<s> Well, there's someone I think might be --

<s> I was?

<s> They do not!
<s> Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?

<s> My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
<s> You're welcome.
<s> Why?
<s> You set me up.
<s> Otherwise known as an orgy?
<s> It's just a party. Daddy.
<s> The prom?  Kat has a date?
<s> You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
<s> North, actually.  How'd you   ?
<s> Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
<s> That's what I just said
<s> I thought you hated those people.
<s> In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
<s> It's a lung cancer issue
<s> So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
<s> She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
<s> Forget it.
<s> Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
<s> But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
<s> William would never have gone to a state school.
<s> I didn't have a choice.
<s> I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
<s> Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
<s> I'm fine. I'm
<s> Who?
<s> But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
<s> Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
<s> It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
<s> Then tell them I had a seizure.
<s> No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
<s> Hi.
<s> Good enough.
<s> Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
<s> Pirate -- no question.
<s> The water's going putrid in the barrels.
<s> The Judgment is ours!
<s> I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
<s> I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
<s> Appointment to what?
<s> I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
<s> If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
<s> Chief says -- he has a God.
<s> You never learned how to speak my language.
<s> With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.

<s> You're right.  Let the men decide.
<s> What's your cut?  How much?
<s> Divorced.
<s> No.
<s> What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
<s> Yeah.
<s> When?
<s> What are you saying?
<s> Watch the news?
<s> Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
<s> Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
<s> I'm on duty.
<s> What would your girlfriend think of that?
<s> My point exactly.
<s> Just a shower?
<s> If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
<s> He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
<s> Hey.
<s> Answer the phone.
<s> That's good.
<s> No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
<s> I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
<s> I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
<s> Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
<s> I'm not moody.
<s> Not what.  Who.
<s> Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
<s> I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
<s> Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
<s> You'll be my first.
<s> Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
<s> Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
<s> I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
<s> I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
<s> And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
<s> Sit down!
<s> As a plumber?!
<s> If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
<s> What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
<s> What are you coming here to do?
<s> That's what it looks like to me.
<s> Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
<s> He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
<s> Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
<s> Oh yeah, why?
<s> Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Not good.
<s> Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
<s> Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
<s> Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
<s> I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
<s> Right. Just a sec.
<s> Sure, what is it?
<s> Yes.
<s> Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
<s> I guess it isn't.
<s> Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
<s> No.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, I know.
<s> Yes, it is, Hal.
<s> The antenna has to be replaced.
<s> Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
<s> Well, where are all of you off to?
<s> No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
<s> Please, it really doesn't matter.
<s> Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
<s> How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
<s> Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
<s> Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
<s> I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
<s> Opening pod bay doors.
<s> Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
<s> No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
<s> Now you're talkin'. See ya...
<s> In the back.  Down the other corridor.
<s> You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
<s> I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
<s> I think you better put him on ice, man.
<s> Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
<s> Last night, two nights ago, three?
<s> You have a good time?
<s> Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
<s> You need five years training to handle a joint like...
<s> I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
<s> What are you talkin' about?
<s> How much?
<s> Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
<s> In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
<s> You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
<s> Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
<s> Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
<s> I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
<s> I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
<s> If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
<s> Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
<s> Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
<s> You stay with me...
<s> You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
<s> Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
<s> Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
<s> I didn't have the time.
<s> Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
<s> Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
<s> What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
<s> This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
<s> I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
<s> Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
<s> Tell me.
<s> Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
<s> You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
<s> You know exactly where they are!
<s> I know...
<s> Dallas. Korben Dallas.
<s> It means, "Never without my permission".
<s> Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
<s> Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
<s> Leeloo..
<s> Vito Cornelius?
<s> ...Leeloo.
<s> Found it?
<s> Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
<s> Where have I heard this song before?
<s> I thought you were divorced.
<s> Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
<s> Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
<s> Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
<s> Exactly.
<s> Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
<s> You gotta push the little yellow button...
<s> It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
<s> How much time is left?
<s> I'm about to, Mr. President.
<s> Got it.
<s> Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
<s> ...I can't wait to be among you.
<s> Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
<s> What's wrong?  Are you alright?
<s> ... What's going on?
<s> You don't understand...
<s> Amy...
<s> There's nothing harder.
<s> Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
<s> Is it?
<s> How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
<s> First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
<s> I'm not so sure about this.
<s> I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
<s> You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
<s> Eddie.
<s> Fuck you!
<s> What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
<s> Why?
<s> Nobody saw you bring her in?
<s> I was well compensated.
<s> They're no friends of mine.
<s> Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
<s> Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
<s> Where does he sell it?
<s> I'm a working stiff, pops.
<s> See ya.
<s> I try to be.
<s> He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
<s> My condolences.
<s> Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.
<s> I don't know.
<s> No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
<s> Will you let me look?
<s> I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
<s> What?
<s> I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
<s> Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
<s> Earth to Alice...
<s> How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
<s> Oh God!  He killed them!
<s> You just stay put.  You need rest.
<s> It's lonely in there, in my room.
<s> Been having bad dreams.
<s> She doesn't want me around
<s> Who said I...wait, what?
<s> My friend, with the funny hand.
<s> No.  A deal's a deal.
<s> Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
<s> I've got to go.
<s> Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
<s> Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
<s> That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
<s> Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
<s> I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
<s> That's their problem.
<s> I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
<s> All of us.  Right?
<s> I can't listen to this.
<s> Stick around, please?
<s> I'd sooner swim!
<s> But if they <u>do</u>?
<s> But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
<s> <u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
<s> I guess.
<s> Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
<s> The sound again?
<s> I...don't know!
<s> Radiation level...constantly rising...
<s> If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
<s> After torpedo room:  Report!
<s> Minus three.
<s> Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
<s> Obviously.
<s> Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
<s> Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
<s> Tell me.
<s> Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
<s> Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
<s> Hmm.
<s> You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
<s> LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
<s> The ambulance guys lugged him up.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> See, I knew you'd be mad.
<s> What are you sorry for?
<s> I want to go home.
<s> I know.
<s> Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
<s> Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
<s> I figured you already heard.
<s> You want me to follow them to Littleton?
<s> What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
<s> Hi honey.
<s> For a while.
<s> See you tomorrow, maybe.
<s> I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
<s> Good.
<s> Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
<s> I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
<s> There's a furnace.
<s> How's that?
<s> Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
<s> You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
<s> Where... how'd you hear that?
<s> Nothing.
<s> From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
<s> In the living room.
<s> You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
<s> You think Jack shot him?
<s> They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
<s> What happened?
<s> No thanks. I don't drink.
<s> Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
<s> Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
<s> Not particularly.
<s> I'm sure he's busy.
<s> Some kids were teasing you?
<s> That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
<s> Alice... I...
<s> Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
<s> Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
<s> Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
<s> We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
<s> Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
<s> Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
<s> Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
<s> This is a remarkable aircraft.
<s> Thank you.
<s> No.
<s> You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
<s> Hold on, Alice.
<s> Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
<s> What?
<s> No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
<s> White House Situation room.
<s> Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
<s> Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
<s> Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
<s> Ted!
<s> Ted, there's no time to explain.
<s> Compute!
<s> And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
<s> No, I've been excited before.
<s> Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
<s> That's okay, ROK.
<s> There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.
<s> It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
<s> Sure.
<s> I don't want to hear that word!
<s> Sixteen 'C', why?
<s> A b...
<s> Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
<s> Don't try to stop me!
<s> I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
<s> Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
<s> Thank you. Cream?
<s> No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
<s> No. I'm all alone.
<s> Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
<s> And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
<s> I can't tell.
<s> Well...not for another two hours.
<s> A hospital? What is it?
<s> Certainly.
<s> No.
<s> I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
<s> I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
<s> That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
<s> Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
<s> Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
<s> Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
<s> Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
<s> Huh?
<s> All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Would you go up, please?
<s> Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
<s> Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
<s> Show me.
<s> This is becoming a serious breach of security.
<s> I am George.
<s> Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
<s> Did you learn anything?
<s> We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
<s> Why'd I do what?
<s> Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
<s> You are married?
<s> We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
<s> Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
<s> ... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
<s> We all did.
<s> No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
<s> Ss-ai!
<s> There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
<s> You understand that.  But how many others will?
<s> Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
<s> Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
<s> Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
<s> Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
<s> Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!

<s> Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
<s> Yes.  That follows.
<s> What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
<s> Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.

<s> ...We're coming in.
<s> Poor bastard.
<s> Maybe.  Maybe not.
<s> Let's waste him.  No offense.
<s> Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
<s> Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
<s> Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
<s> You're really something, ace.
<s> Where is she?
<s> Newt, wait!
<s> That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.

<s> I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
<s> My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
<s> No, sir. This is my own idea.
<s> Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
<s> Yes.
<s> What for?
<s> He asked me to stay.
<s> Hey!
<s> Behold!
<s> I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
<s> I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.

<s> Well. There it is.
<s> Of course not.
<s> Yes?
<s> Yes, indeed.
<s> Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
<s> He's here.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's a secret.
<s> I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
<s> Yes what?
<s> Are you Herr Mozart?
<s> And which one of them do you want me to teach?
<s> Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
<s> She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
<s> So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
<s> I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
<s> Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
<s> How could I not?
<s> How could it not, Excellency?
<s> Who are you?
<s> Please! Just one moment.
<s> I think so.
<s> What for?
<s> But, Your Majesty -
<s> Just let me tell you how it begins.
<s> Certainly, Herr Director.
<s> Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
<s> Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
<s> I know a little. I studied it in my youth.

<s> Dr. Hirsch?
<s> No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
<s> Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
<s> I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
<s> The zoo? Is he rational?
<s> Tea would be nice.
<s> Call me Alex.
<s> A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
<s> I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
<s> Not just a patient -- me.
<s> Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
<s> Your dead friend Jack?
<s> Of course.
<s> I'm freezing.
<s> The zoo?
<s> Don't you remember?
<s> I swear, I don't know this girl.
<s> Has he been refusing food?
<s> This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
<s> You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
<s> No, but we're about to.
<s> Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
<s> Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
<s> Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
<s> Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
<s> I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
<s> She's a jerk.
<s> Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
<s> I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
<s> Pecos Bill.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
<s> I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
<s> What?!
<s> What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
<s> You don't have to say anything.
<s> What about the zoo?
<s> I want you to meet some people.
<s> How shall I do it?
<s> Roger Mathison, Doctor.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> You here again? What do you want?
<s> Yes - sure
<s> Yeah?
<s> I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
<s> Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
<s> All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
<s> Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
<s> That's very simple. I was home.
<s> I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
<s> Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
<s> Why not?
<s> But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
<s> A misunderstood bachelor.
<s> You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
<s> I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
<s> Got a handkerchief?
<s> That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
<s> Hello, darling.
<s> In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
<s> I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
<s> Good morning.
<s> I haven't any.
<s> Was Mrs. Dickson there?
<s> All right. That's all.  Please, Matt.
<s> No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
<s> Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
<s> Did you get the case for the securities?
<s> Is that busy husband of mine busy?
<s> Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
<s> WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
<s> He's not bad at it.
<s> Oh no...
<s> Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
<s> I think I recognize you.
<s> What's going on?
<s> There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
<s> Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.
<s> Pass me some whisky.
<s> I'm out.
<s> Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
<s> I'd appreciate that.
<s> Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
<s> I think he's already feeling better.
<s> You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
<s> No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
<s> We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
<s> Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."
<s> Heard of him.
<s> Don't care.
<s> Bob's upset.
<s> But he killed a lot of men, too.
<s> We're just fine, thank you, sir.
<s> If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
<s> A river pirate.
<s> You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
<s> Where will you find such a girl?
<s> Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
<s> Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
<s> I figured.
<s> Really?
<s> Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
<s> I look forward to seeing it.
<s> So you can't tell me anything?
<s> All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
<s> Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
<s> I'm thinking Dorsia.
<s> Nice?
<s> Yes, dear.
<s> I'm ignoring you.
<s> Oh God, just get it over with.
<s> No. I'm not. Why should I ?
<s> Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
<s> What exactly do you mean?
<s> Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
<s> It's just not.
<s> No, you...didn't?
<s> Maybe it's just the light.
<s> Leaving what?
<s> When?
<s> Just...say...no.
<s> No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
<s> Patrick?
<s> Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
<s> Yes, Patrick?
<s> What are I doing?
<s> No. Flattering, but no.
<s> I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
<s> If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
<s> I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
<s> So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
<s> Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
<s> Who do you ask?
<s> What?
<s> Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
<s> Let's see...  That you were with-
<s> Marcus?
<s> But Marcus denied it?
<s> Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
<s> Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
<s> What am I gonna do?
<s> Al.
<s> You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
<s> Another Martini, Paul?
<s> Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
<s> No, Owen.
<s> Then you've gotta ask him about that.
<s> What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
<s> I know, I know.
<s> You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
<s> Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
<s> Just shut up?
<s> Look at me! I'm gonna change.
<s> Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
<s> 'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
<s> What'd they ever do for you?
<s> Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
<s> Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
<s> Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
<s> Maybe I'm going too fast.
<s> You're making me young again.
<s> It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
<s> 34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
<s> I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
<s> There may be a little less trust after your outburst.
<s> We'll come up with the next big thing.
<s> Cool.
<s> Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
<s> Any irregularity in the pattern.
<s> You know my name.
<s> No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
<s> Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
<s> Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!
<s> Gary.
<s> Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
<s> What d'you mean?
<s> I didn't plan this.
<s> Oh we're not going to the campus.
<s> I've got a girlfriend, remember?
<s> I could get it out of him.
<s> What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
<s> Groovy.
<s> Kiss me.
<s> The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
<s> Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
<s> Yes?
<s> Thanks.
<s> Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
<s> Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
<s> Well, you can't always get what you want.
<s> Good on ya, man.
<s> Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
<s> If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
<s> I'm sorry?
<s> Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
<s> A Chigro?
<s> Sure.
<s> I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
<s> Only sailors use condoms, man.
<s> Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
<s> It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
<s> Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
<s> Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
<s> I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
<s> That's not mine.
<s> Where did you learn to shoot?
<s> Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
<s> Sea bass.
<s> They're mutated sea bass.
<s> Please allow me to demonstrate.
<s> Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
<s> Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
<s> Show me.
<s> You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
<s> I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
<s> Well, it's kind of weird.
<s> ... preserve...
<s> Mr. John Steed, please.
<s> This isn't a game.
<s> Thank you, Steed.
<s> 'Our revels now are ended.'
<s> 1922. Why the kippers?
<s> And just what is the game?
<s> We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
<s> Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
<s> Small talk.  Try the weather.
<s> Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
<s> ... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
<s> Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
<s> I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
<s> The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
<s> Orders.
<s> I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
<s> No idea who. No idea why ...
<s> ... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
<s> I see.
<s> It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
<s> Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
<s> She may try to kill you.
<s> How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
<s> Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
<s> No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
<s> Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
<s> Perish the thought.
<s> Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
<s> He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
<s> I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
<s> Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
<s> You're kidding.
<s> Hey, man, congratulations!
<s> What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
<s> Not interested.
<s> He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
<s> Ooh, be still, my heart.
<s> I'm very happy for you two.
<s> The car for Debbie?
<s> Maybe it had something to do.
<s> Keep me informed.
<s> Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
<s> You're going to have a bachelor party?
<s> I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
<s> Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
<s> C'mon, I knew it was you.
<s> Let's get naked.
<s> Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
<s> Any time, Al.
<s> What are you talking about, asshole?
<s> Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
<s> Yeah, I guess so.
<s> Ha, ha, ha.
<s> This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
<s> Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
<s> Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
<s> The phone made me do it!
<s> No, Brett, I...
<s> C'mon. I insist.
<s> Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
<s> What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
<s> Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
<s> Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
<s> I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
<s> I don't know.
<s> -- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
<s> That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
<s> -- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
<s> Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
<s> Thanks for the speakers.
<s> I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
<s> -- I told you to stay next to me!
<s> -- Never mind.
<s> C'mon, let's crawl home.
<s> Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
<s> I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
<s> When I was twenty.
<s> Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
<s> Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
<s> Well, you did invite me here.
<s> Got anything to drink in there?
<s> Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
<s> You could check. It'd be in his files.
<s> Yes.
<s> So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
<s> Then who --
<s> Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
<s> Fire.
<s> Four months.
<s> Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
<s> Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
<s> What the hell are we waiting for?
<s> Backdraft.
<s> I was ahead of my time.
<s> Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
<s> Okay.
<s> Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
<s> He's out.
<s> Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
<s> In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
<s> Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
<s> You like everybody, Ronald.
<s> I know you.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> "The Strawberries"?
<s> Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
<s> You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
<s> What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
<s> You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
<s> You've really got a problem.
<s> We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.
<s> What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
<s> Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
<s> Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
<s> Meaning?
<s> Damn skippy.
<s> You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
<s> No costume.  No blackface.
<s> Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
<s> Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
<s> So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
<s> What are there character traits?
<s> Who are the other characters?
<s> If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
<s> Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
<s> They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
<s> I want to speak with you.
<s> Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
<s> Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never gave me no trouble.
<s> Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
<s> Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
<s> The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
<s> This is Cheeba.
<s> What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
<s> A gift.
<s> I don't want to hear it.
<s> He's just playing big brother.
<s> DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
<s> Give me the gun.
<s> Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
<s> You sound like the media.
<s> Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
<s> Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
<s> Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
<s> I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
<s> You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
<s> Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
<s> This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
<s> I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
<s> I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
<s> Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
<s> ...I heard different, thought that was...
<s> Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
<s> Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
<s> What do you want to know?
<s> Gots no intention of ending up broke.
<s> Never read a book in my whole life.
<s> Y'know what?
<s> You can go now.
<s> I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
<s> It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
<s> I never was more in earnest.
<s> How do you do, sir?
<s> And so I am.
<s> I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
<s> I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
<s> Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
<s> You are going to drive to the frontier.
<s> The gentleman has nothing contraband.
<s> Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
<s> Only the agency of servants.
<s> I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
<s> Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
<s> How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
<s> I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
<s> Old fool!
<s> Then you must get it.
<s> With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
<s> I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
<s> Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
<s> As much as possible.
<s> Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
<s> Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
<s> When is he to go?
<s> Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him "good luck."
<s> O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
<s> I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
<s> Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
<s> Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
<s> The milkmaid's daughter?
<s> I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
<s> Will he wish to know the details of this night?
<s> None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
<s> We found him like this --
<s> HEY!
<s> Shut up, Mueller.
<s> It's... too slow.
<s> Tell me about them.
<s> I didn't shoot West --
<s> Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
<s> Do what?
<s> Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
<s> Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
<s> Why?
<s> You're the only one missing a grenade.
<s> That's exactly what he says about you.
<s> Look in my pack.
<s> That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
<s> Put it down!
<s> Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
<s> Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
<s> I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
<s> I didn't do anything --
<s> Who killed Pike?
<s> What the hell are you talking about --
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> You're drunk --
<s> You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
<s> Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
<s> Good cop/bad cop?
<s> You're right. We should sit in silence.
<s> So noted.
<s> I don't think that has anything to do with --
<s> Watch me.
<s> Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
<s> That bugs you too?
<s> Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
<s> Good idea.
<s> You couldn't have known --
<s> You mean the falsely accused?
<s> So you took off your shirt?
<s> He wanted more than that.
<s> "You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
<s> Because he'd shot Mueller.
<s> Childs.
<s> He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
<s> Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
<s> Where's your shirt, Mueller?
<s> He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
<s> Sir, yes, sir!
<s> Thank you.
<s> Not yet.
<s> Why?
<s> I'll go in right now and get that eye.
<s> I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
<s> I know.
<s> That's terrible.
<s> No, I understand.
<s> Oh, so this is a tall tale?
<s> That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
<s> Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
<s> You think I'm up for it?
<s> Okay.
<s> I will.
<s> I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
<s> Can we talk?
<s> Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
<s> Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
<s> How what happens?
<s> I have the rest of my life to find out.
<s> 'Fraid so.
<s> I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
<s> This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
<s> It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
<s> Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
<s> Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
<s> We rented a car.
<s> He's up with your father.
<s> You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
<s> I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
<s> Do you want to stop?
<s> Name it.
<s> Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
<s> I'm asking what you're here for.
<s> He says he feels safe here.
<s> Oh.  We are Russian.
<s> Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
<s> So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
<s> I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
<s> He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
<s> It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
<s> Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
<s> You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
<s> What?
<s> I don't want to talk about him.
<s> If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
<s> Okay we won't talk about it.
<s> Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
<s> Sometimes.
<s> Sometimes neither.
<s> There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
<s> You didn't mind too much.
<s> Get out
<s> Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> Not really. Maybe a little.
<s> I'm trying to quit.
<s> It's alright.
<s> No. I think I better just go.
<s> It's not mine either.
<s> Maybe you will find out.
<s> I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
<s> Cash.
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
<s> Can I come in?
<s> I do. God's truth. I do.
<s> Hey.
<s> No, ma'am.
<s> These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
<s> Yeah.
<s> That's not right, really, cuz I...
<s> Stop what?
<s> It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.
<s> Yeah.
<s> That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
<s> Let go of my arm...
<s> BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
<s> Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!
<s> Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the only man with her.
<s> GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
<s> Get this Goddamn thing off me!
<s> I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
<s> Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
<s> Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
<s> You drink whiskey?
<s> Anything.
<s> By myself?
<s> I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
<s> Maybe I won't.
<s> What'chu sayin'?
<s> Don't know if God wanna see me.
<s> I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
<s> I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
<s> All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
<s> Hey, when in Rome --
<s> High spirits, desire, commitment.
<s> Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
<s> I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
<s> Why weren't you at the platform?
<s> I can see that.
<s> You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
<s> Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
<s> You were too far behind.
<s> You can trust me.
<s> San is an honorable title.
<s> What...?  Why?
<s> It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
<s> Let's go.  Him first.
<s> He gets as much as he wants.
<s> Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
<s> He drinks.
<s> The cheese...
<s> No one's keeping him here.
<s> Save it, I already took the tour.
<s> Not in that company.
<s> What?
<s> The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
<s> Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
<s> Look.
<s> I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
<s> Had in mind something a little more radical.
<s> What about E.M.S. recombination?
<s> I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
<s> Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
<s> Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
<s> Garbage man?
<s> Why, yes, of course.
<s> And what in your estimation works?
<s> Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
<s> Nexus designated Zhora:  incept June 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field.
<s> I like you too.
<s> No rust?
<s> They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
<s> For holes.
<s> I bet I would.
<s> I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
<s> So?
<s> Can you?  I couldn't.
<s> Right.
<s> Not too good.
<s> It wasn't very good last night, was it?
<s> Don't be fooled by appearances.
<s> Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
<s> What's a long time?
<s> What?
<s> Sorry.
<s> Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
<s> But how come I'd be there?
<s> A tortoise.  What's that?
<s> Of course.
<s> I never seen a turtle.
<s> As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
<s> Yes?
<s> How do you do?
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> Shallow? I'm shallow?!
<s> It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
<s> Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
<s> You're lost?
<s> Why doesn't that surprise me?
<s> Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
<s> Get away from me!!
<s> Rogers Hornsby?!?
<s> Heck, no!  What?!
<s> I know a short-cut.
<s> Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
<s> Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
<s> The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
<s> Doing what?
<s> How long would you need me?
<s> Sure.
<s> They like Dr. Pepper.
<s> My Mom and Dad.
<s> Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
<s> It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
<s> Okay.
<s> Why?!
<s> Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
<s> Yes!
<s> It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
<s> Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
<s> Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
<s> Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
<s> Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
<s> Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!
<s> You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
<s> Is that what you call it?
<s> My mother's like that.
<s> Gerade aus dann links!
<s> It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
<s> No, son. A pitcher.
<s> Shit is a French word?
<s> Merci!
<s> Adult Bookstore.  Why?
<s> I promise. Is that all?
<s> Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
<s> Uh, I think they have.
<s> You nut!
<s> Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
<s> 1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
<s> You don't have a computer in your cabin?
<s> Goodbye.
<s> What?
<s> Of what?
<s> Up there!!
<s> Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
<s> Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
<s> Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
<s> No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
<s> Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
<s> I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
<s> Then after that it's safe.
<s> No.
<s> All our friends...
<s> I'm not hungry.
<s> Would you like a tranquilizer?
<s> Honey?
<s> No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
<s> Right here!
<s> What?
<s> Well, we did in my family!
<s> Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
<s> Just open the door.
<s> I don't believe it!
<s> To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
<s> Some time.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> Your stuff?  Let me see that.
<s> Oh, yes.
<s> Well, that's blunt!
<s> I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
<s> Yes, you do!
<s> I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
<s> You didn't stop anywhere else?!
<s> Come on.
<s> Um...uh...
<s> I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
<s> Roger, Wolf One.
<s> It must be great.
<s> Yes?
<s> Yes.
<s> I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
<s> Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
<s> Jeffrey.
<s> I'll go then.
<s> No.
<s> Yeah, hurry up though.
<s> Who's it, you mean.
<s> Hello.
<s> Kiss me.
<s> Do you love me?
<s> 'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
<s> Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  Hey, pretty, pretty.
<s> He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
<s> Be right down.
<s> Jeffrey, when you see your father.
<s> Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
<s> Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
<s> Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
<s> Uh-uh.
<s> Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
<s> I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
<s> Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
<s> Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
<s> It's okay. Don't worry about it.
<s> No way. I'm about to blow up.
<s> Actually. I've been in twice.
<s> I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
<s> Okay, Sandy.
<s> Goodnight.
<s> I'm really sorry.
<s> No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
<s> Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
<s> Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
<s> Stop it Mike.
<s> Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
<s> The Duke?  What did you do?
<s> Any tips on where these guys may be?
<s> What?
<s> You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
<s> He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
<s> Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
<s> No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
<s> This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
<s> We're here brother.
<s> Connor, is that you?
<s> What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
<s> I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
<s> German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
<s> All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
<s> Aye.
<s> A-fuckin'-men!
<s> Rule of thumb?
<s> Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
<s> Of course they were. How many?
<s> You killed my... my...
<s> Really want to know?
<s> These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
<s> New hitman wants to leave his mark
<s> They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
<s> Why was I not informed of this?
<s> Sweet-n-low!
<s> It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!
<s> Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
<s> Just called ta torture us did ya?
<s> Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.
<s> We promise.
<s> I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
<s> Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
<s> You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
<s> Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
<s> You know them personally?
<s> Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
<s> I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
<s> God have mercy on my soul.
<s> What do you want me to say?
<s> The... The funny man.
<s> Right. The blond guy.
<s> The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
<s> He says. This is he.
<s> Would they do that?
<s> You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
<s> Yeah, I saw it.
<s> You think we're going to be chased?
<s> Nothing. Go ahead.
<s> Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
<s> He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
<s> I don't want to use it.
<s> I keep it for emergencies.
<s> I'll say it.
<s> It's not a plan. It's just --
<s> Sure.
<s> This morning.
<s> OK.
<s> I don't think we can do that.
<s> You don't know how to hotwire.
<s> Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
<s> That's not correct.
<s> Shut up!
<s> That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
<s> What the fuck are we doing out here?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
<s> I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
<s> Scale the --
<s> Yes, he did.
<s> Death.
<s> Who?
<s> Let them fight.
<s> I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
<s> Who's got the car keys?
<s> I hear you're a good thief.
<s> Uh-uh.
<s> I thought your parents were in Italy.
<s> So who's going to know?
<s> I'll just drive my car.
<s> You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
<s> Well, don't blame me. I told you.
<s> That's your domain.
<s> His name was Swifty?
<s> That's too bad.
<s> He wouldn't move.
<s> But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
<s> The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
<s> Don't threaten me, Bob.
<s> I didn't think there was an alarm.
<s> We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
<s> Now!
<s> Yeah. Hey, Clay.
<s> Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
<s> 26 weeks.
<s> Did you hear that?
<s> He's damn good.
<s> We're just going over a few things.
<s> No, my friend knows her.
<s> Sure.
<s> She is a good looking woman.
<s> There was a mistake.
<s> And the Landy woman?
<s> Save it for Bourne.
<s> With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
<s> I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
<s> No good options left?
<s> Thanks.
<s> And?
<s> Jesus...
<s> Keep going...
<s> How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
<s> I don't know who that is.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> -- my coat -- but we should --
<s> -- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
<s> What?
<s> There must be another way!
<s> Tell me later.
<s> It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
<s> You do?
<s> Yes.
<s> Who is Pamela Landy?
<s> What is this, a game?
<s> I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
<s> Careful...
<s> What's that?
<s> I'm working on it.
<s> Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
<s> Who's this?
<s> Me? Four years.
<s> Yes, sir -- ma'am...
<s> I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
<s> The Scots will fight for us?
<s> You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
<s> You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
<s> Scotland. He intends --
<s> ...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
<s> You mock us with a smile?
<s> You fancy him.
<s> Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
<s> We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
<s> I could crush you like a roach.
<s> I will not.
<s> I should'a remembered the eggs.
<s> We don't split up!
<s> He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
<s> Shall I leave, M'lord?
<s> He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
<s> ...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
<s> This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
<s> Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
<s> Yes, you are. And you must wake.
<s> How do you know this?
<s> ...I wouldn't know.
<s> I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
<s> She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
<s> It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
<s> We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
<s> Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
<s> I am trying.
<s> They've tricked us.
<s> Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
<s> Aye. But it won't let me dream.
<s> How soon?...
<s> So what did you find.
<s> Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
<s> My father has a bad memory, too?
<s> Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
<s> Cute, Evan.
<s> Straight up.
<s> Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
<s> But I... I need those books.
<s> He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
<s> Of course.
<s> Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
<s> You'll see.
<s> Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
<s> Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
<s> Which is?
<s> It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
<s> Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
<s> Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
<s> Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
<s> We'll find out soon enough.
<s> I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
<s> Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
<s> Evan Treborn.
<s> Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
<s> It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
<s> Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
<s> Oh my God oh my God...
<s> Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
<s> I thought so. Where's your husband?
<s> Yes, Monsieur.
<s> -- Will he keep his word?
<s> In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
<s> How long can I afford to stay closed?
<s> Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
<s> I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
<s> -- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
<s> Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
<s> So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
<s> You needn't be concerned about me.
<s> What are they?
<s> And the other alternative?
<s> How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
<s> Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
<s> He hasn't played it in a long time.
<s> In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
<s> Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?
<s> It doesn't matter.
<s> You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
<s> If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
<s> All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
<s> But what about us?
<s> Won't you join us?
<s> Goodnight.
<s> We'll discuss it later.
<s> Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
<s> Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
<s> -- Yes?
<s> I love you very much, my dear.
<s> And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
<s> What for?
<s> Any time.
<s> Here it is.
<s> Yes. What is it you want?
<s> Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
<s> Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
<s> Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
<s> Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
<s> By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
<s> How do you do, Mr. Rick?
<s> Perhaps.
<s> I see what you mean.
<s> How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
<s> When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
<s> It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
<s> -- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
<s> He'll take one.
<s> Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
<s> Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
<s> Huh?
<s> What friend?
<s> Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
<s> Sacha, she's had enough.
<s> -- Sacha, call a cab.
<s> Well, what makes you think I haven't?
<s> If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
<s> Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> Yeah, boss?
<s> Worse than Warsaw.
<s> You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft.
<s> Why do they have to die for me?
<s> Shut up.
<s> It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
<s> Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.
<s> He's your cute thing.
<s> I can't take him to work.
<s> Is that Jango?
<s> That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
<s> Great.  Really.
<s> Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
<s> You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
<s> There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
<s> What about the sender?
<s> What's going on down there?
<s> Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
<s> That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
<s> Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
<s> I braided them.
<s> I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
<s> Hallelujah.
<s> Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
<s> Deep, real deep.
<s> Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
<s> You cook very well!
<s> Better than I can!
<s> I doubt it. She's just an...
<s> She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
<s> Daddy, *please*...
<s> No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
<s> It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
<s> Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
<s> Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
<s> Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
<s> Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
<s> Mr. Rose *knows*?
<s> Nothing.
<s> *Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
<s> What do you want me to *do*?
<s> She knows how to take care of herself.
<s> Sure. Thanks.
<s> No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
<s> Yes, I *have*!
<s> No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
<s> Well, they aren't.
<s> Someone not from Maine.
<s> It's okay--I don't mind.
<s> No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
<s> Have you enlisted?
<s> Really! Is it serious?
<s> *And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
<s> Right.
<s> Okay...
<s> Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
<s> And I *love* her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do!  I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that.
<s> Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
<s> I don't know it.
<s> Nobody's named this one yet.
<s> It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
<s> How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
<s> I'm happy I amuse you.
<s> I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
<s> You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
<s> It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
<s> I don't know.  Just promise me one thing.
<s> Right.
<s> No trouble.
<s> Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
<s> Now, now. He's a good boy.
<s> You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
<s> Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
<s> It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk.
<s> That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
<s> Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
<s> Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
<s> Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
<s> A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
<s> Big.Com. That Internet thing.
<s> Everything looks in order.
<s> The standard ten.
<s> Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
<s> Gee... What makes you say that?
<s> Isn't it always?
<s> Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
<s> After you cut her loose.
<s> It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
<s> And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?
<s> So what? We hide, right?
<s> I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
<s> How's that? He works for Gillette.
<s> Eight A.M. flight.
<s> I have a good crew.
<s> No. Just confidence.
<s> We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
<s> You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
<s> I think I just broke my hand.
<s> Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
<s> All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
<s> Just play a part. A little acting.
<s> Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
<s> You're just going to have to trust me.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> For what? A couple hundred bucks?
<s> You sure we're clear?
<s> Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
<s> Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
<s> But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
<s> Escorts!
<s> Jake? Customs?
<s> Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.
<s> That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different.
<s> No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
<s> HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
<s> You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport...
<s> In over your head?
<s> I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
<s> Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
<s> You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
<s> I try.
<s> Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
<s> What do you want?
<s> Roger that.
<s> That's what I'm talking about.
<s> No. Thanks.
<s> Maybe another time.
<s> I don't know anything about it.
<s> Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
<s> Who was he?
<s> Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
<s> I. sold the car.
<s> I've got something to tell you.
<s> There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
<s> You've got such beautiful hands.
<s> It's only hair. I haven't changed.
<s> What about a drink on the way home?
<s> Marion. It's a book.
<s> Leave it.
<s> Never. Why do you ask?
<s> Well, thank you anyway.
<s> There's a casino in this hotel.
<s> Your father?
<s> You choose.
<s> What kind of trouble?
<s> It won't.
<s> Let it go.
<s> Well, life's not fair. We know that.
<s> Have I?
<s> If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
<s> That bitch? No.
<s> Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
<s> I'll tell you later.
<s> Jack.
<s> No.
<s> What for?
<s> I don't gamble.
<s> No.
<s> Very impressive.
<s> Does he win?
<s> Bruised.
<s> Right, that checks out here.
<s> I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
<s> Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
<s> We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
<s> Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
<s> But how do you know you exist?
<s> Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
<s> Hmmm...
<s> Yes, Doolittle.
<s> I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
<s> Which one?
<s> Commander Powell is dead.
<s> Out where?
<s> Who cares?
<s> Ah, negative drop.
<s> -- Remark.
<s> Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
<s> I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
<s> Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
<s> Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
<s> Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
<s> No?
<s> Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
<s> Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.
<s> You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
<s> You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
<s> I ain't mad at you...
<s> Later.
<s> It's a rule.
<s> Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
<s> But why can't we stay here?
<s> Mommy, where are you?
<s> Girl's gotta make a living.
<s> Logan Cale.
<s> The one you're wearing?
<s> Lauren's not my wife.
<s> So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
<s> You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
<s> Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
<s> The other ones?
<s> Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
<s> On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
<s> Look, thank you for this but--
<s> Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
<s> A friend of your fiance's.
<s> With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
<s> He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
<s> I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
<s> Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
<s> I understand.
<s> You did.
<s> My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
<s> Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
<s> How's this about me?
<s> Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
<s> Got a pencil?
<s> One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
<s> No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
<s> They don't have a lot of moving parts.
<s> Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
<s> I'll bet you can.  Sit.
<s> She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
<s> She's gonna want to hear for herself.
<s> I'm a toy to her.
<s> I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
<s> More than anything in the world.
<s> What's it worth to you?
<s> Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
<s> One more time in English.
<s> Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
<s> Damn straight we are.
<s> The paint!
<s> ...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
<s> Tickets?
<s> And if it ain't cleaned off?
<s> Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
<s> Sure.
<s> The easy way.
<s> Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
<s> What's gone?
<s> Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
<s> Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
<s> That's it?
<s> Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
<s> A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
<s> No, you gimme your gun, boy!
<s> So... that's it?
<s> Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
<s> Not until like... eighth grade.
<s> When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
<s> Donnie! Give it back!
<s> Sure.
<s> I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
<s> So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
<s> And you'd never been there before?
<s> And what?
<s> Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
<s> Where are we going?
<s> Who's Frank?
<s> Yeah...
<s> When did you stop taking your medication?
<s> I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
<s> Why should we care?
<s> Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
<s> Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
<s> Would you like to talk about this friend?
<s> I don't own a television.
<s> I think about girls a lot.
<s> I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
<s> No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
<s> But you were punished.
<s> What else makes you feel regret?
<s> Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
<s> God exists because you're horny.
<s> If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
<s> But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
<s> You're not a bitch.
<s> He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
<s> The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
<s> I think we've all seen "Bonanza".
<s> Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
<s> Beg pardon?
<s> Thank God for bunge cords.
<s> What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
<s> Yah?
<s> They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
<s> Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
<s> I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
<s> Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
<s> Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
<s> We all do. Now let's go.
<s> Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
<s> Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
<s> They told me to practice.
<s> This pageant's like a roach motel.
<s> Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
<s> I wonder how she's gonna fix that one.
<s> I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
<s> "Proud... to be... an... American."
<s> Okay, everybody, listen up!
<s> Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
<s> Harold!
<s> The President of the United States.
<s> "My dear"...
<s> "My dear President"...
<s> Is that all?
<s> Send for my car...
<s> Yankee Poodle.
<s> I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
<s> If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
<s> Then you don't wanna work hard?
<s> In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
<s> By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
<s> I can't do it...
<s> We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
<s> That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
<s> Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
<s> All right -- I'll go out and find one.
<s> Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -
<s> That's it...
<s> Why -- why -- of course.
<s> Oh, would you...?
<s> I've always thought that myself.
<s> If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
<s> Well, these things take time.
<s> Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
<s> Shut up!
<s> Good morning, sir.
<s> Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
<s> Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
<s> Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
<s> Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
<s> Yes, I think I can.
<s> I could easily arrange...
<s> I am very pleased to meet you.
<s> Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
<s> You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
<s> That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
<s> ...I learned a long time ago.
<s> Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
<s> That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
<s> Say "Mmmerrick."
<s> Say "Mmmerrick."
<s> Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
<s> Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.
<s> I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
<s> That's a canopy, John.
<s> How is your tea, John?
<s> Yes, John.
<s> Oh yes! It was wonderful!
<s> Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
<s> Fine.
<s> No, he's very upset about something.
<s> But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
<s> I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
<s> You're losing your temper!
<s> No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!
<s> I... but I...
<s> The second note to wake the Gods...
<s> No... no...
<s> Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
<s> Yes?
<s> What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...
<s> What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
<s> Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
<s> Well you started it.
<s> What a stupid idea.
<s> What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
<s> You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
<s> Come on, move it!
<s> I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
<s> No.
<s> You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
<s> I know!
<s> Don't you FEEL it?
<s> What's it all about?
<s> I met this girl...
<s> Make your mind up.
<s> The sun! That's it!
<s> What "magic"?
<s> So?
<s> No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
<s> Well, come on!
<s> Like fish.
<s> No! Arrgh!
<s> Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
<s> I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
<s> I was sitting there.
<s> It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
<s> Let me do something for myself for a change!
<s> You will wait?
<s> Please.
<s> No, it is NOT.
<s> It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
<s> What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
<s> YOU do it!
<s> Relax!
<s> Sh!
<s> GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
<s> No... he's not... not... there...
<s> I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
<s> In the room?
<s> Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
<s> No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
<s> Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
<s> Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
<s> Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
<s> I don't know any jokes about your name.
<s> Yeah?
<s> It's okay. I didn't think you were.
<s> Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
<s> Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
<s> Very much.
<s> Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
<s> I'm fine.
<s> No, I'm okay for now.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
<s> Sounds good. But right now I should go.
<s> I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
<s> Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
<s> Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> Would you get me another, Joely?
<s> I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
<s> Yeah, Tangerine?
<s> Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
<s> I'd like to... take you out or something.
<s> Not yet. Not married.
<s> Hi.
<s> I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
<s> I'm Joel.
<s> Oh.
<s> Make love?
<s> Hey, Joel --
<s> Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
<s> I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
<s> I guess so.
<s> That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
<s> Hi.
<s> Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
<s> On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
<s> I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
<s> It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
<s> I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
<s> It's not somebody else.
<s> Hi.
<s> Nah, I don't know.
<s> Yeah. Cool.
<s> Very cool. Trippy.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Do you swear you didn't know?
<s> Then why did you ask me?
<s> Alexander Pope?
<s> I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
<s> It was a mutual decision.
<s> December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
<s> She came to help, Howard.
<s> Yeah, probably a good idea.
<s> That's fine, Stan.
<s> Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
<s> She likes you okay.
<s> Siwash, huh?
<s> The Clock People?
<s> Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
<s> Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
<s> If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
<s> Like what?
<s> If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
<s> What guy?
<s> My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
<s> American Cheese. The king of road food.
<s> When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
<s> As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.
<s> I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
<s> A job for me?
<s> On my way.
<s> Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
<s> I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
<s> We'll make it.
<s> "Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
<s> You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
<s> That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
<s> What's on your mind?
<s> Justin.
<s> Justin. I won't let you die.
<s> Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
<s> No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
<s> Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
<s> In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
<s> Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
<s> Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
<s> Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
<s> What do you want me to say?
<s> Yes...
<s> You're insane. You've lost your mind.
<s> We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
<s> Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is?  It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil.  It's a liberating experience.
<s> What makes you think I'll miss?
<s> Then who the fuck are you?
<s> I'm not the Devil.
<s> You're lying...!
<s> Locked and cocked.
<s> ...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Come again, Skipper?
<s> What about the life readings you picked up?
<s> Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
<s> We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
<s> What's going on in there, Starck?
<s> He's dead...
<s> Yes.
<s> Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
<s> Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
<s> Not according to the computer.
<s> Can you shut it down?
<s> Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
<s> Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...
<s> If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
<s> Ship's log.
<s> I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
<s> I can't believe we built this.
<s> "Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
<s> Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
<s> What is this? Where's Reed?
<s> And you can? Power it up?
<s> I don't care about rocks, I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
<s> Youthful high spirits.
<s> Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
<s> Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
<s> I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
<s> Well maybe you should date him.
<s> Ben. Are you okay?
<s> Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
<s> Ben! Ben!
<s> Ben, are you there?
<s> Oh, it is.
<s> I can go hotter!
<s> They're not costumes.
<s> But all these people...
<s> Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
<s> That's the temperature of the sun.
<s> Dude. That's my sister.
<s> Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
<s> And if he's not...?
<s> That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
<s> I was talking about us. Working together.
<s> What? What do you mean you --
<s> What...?  Oh.
<s> What in the world would give me that idea?
<s> You were?
<s> Why didn't you say something?
<s> You need a doctor.
<s> Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
<s> Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
<s> Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
<s> First door on your left!
<s> Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?
<s> Don't strain yourself.
<s> Where did you hear that?
<s> Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
<s> I didn't say that.
<s> It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
<s> Dad says!
<s> I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
<s> Really?
<s> The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
<s> I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
<s> It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
<s> I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
<s> So what makes you so sensitive?
<s> I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
<s> That's me, Merv.
<s> Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards.
<s> This ain't no cop.
<s> Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
<s> What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
<s> What variables?
<s> What's the big deal?
<s> It was okay.
<s> It was nice.
<s> Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
<s> You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
<s> No. But it's a nice idea.
<s> There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
<s> He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
<s> That's the name they gave me.
<s> Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
<s> And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
<s> Thanks. So do you.
<s> The point sounds fine.
<s> We keep them.
<s> We keep them, in case the people come back.
<s> Yeah. It's my sister's.
<s> No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
<s> I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
<s> Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
<s> I'll get you the notes.
<s> Hi, Stacy. How are you?
<s> Awake? What do you mean?
<s> Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.
<s> Tell me. What do you want?
<s> They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
<s> Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
<s> One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
<s> No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
<s> Jesus! Did I say that?
<s> It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
<s> Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.
<s> You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
<s> OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 
<s> Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
<s> What for?
<s> Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
<s> Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
<s> Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
<s> You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport.
<s> Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
<s> It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
<s> That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
<s> Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
<s> Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.
<s> Where'd you get this?
<s> I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
<s> We can't risk letting them in.
<s> I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --
<s> They'll be back.
<s> I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
<s> We're going to get my little girl.
<s> Where is everyone?
<s> But it's got teeth.
<s> We're lucky to be alive.
<s> It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
<s> Follow me.
<s> Fuck you too.
<s> Why don't you go check it out?
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> He's dead.
<s> Anyone else?
<s> But --
<s> Okay then.
<s> He shot you the other time.
<s> The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
<s> Seven.
<s> Oh? And what's that?
<s> They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
<s> F-f-fuck you.
<s> Clear!
<s> Duh hickey.
<s> Gimme the keys.
<s> You keep that key handy.
<s> Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
<s> They'll tear this place down within the hour.
<s> Not without you!!!
<s> All right.
<s> I'm fine, I really am.
<s> Deal.
<s> Putting on my armor.
<s> Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
<s> But I'm the one up there on the screen.
<s> It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
<s> Huh.
<s> I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.
<s> Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
<s> I know, but --
<s> GET OUT!
<s> Fired?
<s> ...Yes.
<s> Dick, we need some time apart --
<s> Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Is Kaminski a Communist?
<s> Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
<s> Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
<s> Please, Francie...
<s> I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
<s> Thank you.
<s> As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
<s> No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
<s> They'll mend.
<s> Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
<s> Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
<s> Enh.
<s> Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
<s> Well, the studio told me not to.
<s> Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
<s> But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something... 
<s> Think I'll have a glass.
<s> I took the early rounds.
<s> I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
<s> And?
<s> That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
<s> Huh?
<s> Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
<s> Huh?
<s> Well... I'll act like I do until I do.
<s> Oh Harry...
<s> Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
<s> Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
<s> Yes.
<s> I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
<s> 'Golden Boy.'
<s> You got it.
<s> Why are these all opened?
<s> You kill me, Mama.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> Yes, Mama.
<s> Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
<s> Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
<s> Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which... 
<s> And what's that?
<s> Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree?
<s> What is that to you? Evil as you are.
<s> People can be kinder than you think.
<s> Kill me and have done with it.
<s> A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
<s> Yes. I want this over and done with.
<s> Quite right!
<s> Is he not back yet?
<s> To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
<s> I wish to be your husband.
<s> Your decision. For us.
<s> I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
<s> It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
<s> Why the change? What about your work?
<s> They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
<s> Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
<s> Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
<s> That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
<s> Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
<s> Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
<s> Thank you, Henry.
<s> Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
<s> So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
<s> Victor, explain yourself.
<s> Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
<s> Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
<s> I was careless.
<s> Sure.
<s> You okay?
<s> Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
<s> Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
<s> Good point.
<s> I'll go take a look.
<s> Wet. I don't know.
<s> Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out...
<s> I can't, Barry...
<s> Somebody'll see.
<s> I need you so much, Claudette.
<s> Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen.
<s> Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
<s> I don't love Neddy.
<s> Ned!
<s> One night on the town.
<s> I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
<s> You've made a science out of coincidence.
<s> Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
<s> Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.
<s> So do I just follow you?
<s> Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?
<s> I'm exhausted.
<s> If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
<s> It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
<s> No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
<s> Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
<s> Yes, they do.
<s> I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
<s> Pass.
<s> He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.
<s> I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
<s> To yours.
<s> I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
<s> You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
<s> Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim.
<s> I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
<s> Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
<s> We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.
<s> Sure.
<s> Where are you taking us?
<s> In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
<s> What you said to me in the room.
<s> Yes.
<s> Okay.
<s> Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
<s> Not many.
<s> You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
<s> Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
<s> Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
<s> Six-fifty.
<s> This is a private club. You're not welcome.
<s> These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
<s> Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
<s> It's not your fault, it's her fault!
<s> Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
<s> Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
<s> What?
<s> It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
<s> Where are you?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Scarred for life, that's how I am!
<s> Don't say my name.
<s> "Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what you can find.
<s> Standing right here in my office.
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
<s> I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
<s> The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
<s> Wouldn't dream of it, sir.
<s> "We'll all have lunch."  Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS!
<s> Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
<s> I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself.
<s> I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.
<s> Motherachrist...
<s> No problem, sir!
<s> Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
<s> Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak it is.
<s> Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
<s> What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
<s> You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
<s> Sir?
<s> She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?
<s> She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
<s> What "all females"?  If I'm the only --
<s> Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.
<s> Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
<s> Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
<s> Is this my glory, sir?
<s> Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
<s> You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
<s> Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much.
<s> I saw an article...
<s> I'm only trying to warn you in case --
<s> What about him.
<s> "Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."
<s> Well, now I feel so much better.
<s> I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
<s> You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
<s> That's a good story.
<s> He was married?
<s> "Dad."
<s> Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.
<s> No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
<s> That's not right.
<s> That your desk?  I'll take this one.
<s> Shut your hole, Slutnik.
<s> I don't know.  Seems...
<s> All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
<s> No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
<s> Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
<s> Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
<s> Oh yes he will.
<s> It's good to see you, Nick.
<s> Most people don't.
<s> When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
<s> I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
<s> I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
<s> How do you know?
<s> Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
<s> Speak of the devil.
<s> He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
<s> Nick Tatopoulos.
<s> That's the problem. He did.
<s> Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
<s> Five bucks.
<s> He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
<s> So have dinner with me tonight.
<s> Where's Luc and Pierre?
<s> You're fast.
<s> It's Tatopoulos.
<s> We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Uh uh! What did we talk about?
<s> Open.
<s> ... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I...
<s> ... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
<s> I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
<s> I played Richard III...
<s> No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
<s> ...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
<s> Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
<s> Could they be the miners?
<s> You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
<s> We'd never have the budget for this.
<s> Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
<s> My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
<s> Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit.
<s> Lt. Madison, GO.
<s> Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
<s> All systems are working, Commander.
<s> I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
<s> Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
<s> Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
<s> Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
<s> All right. Put me back on with him.
<s> Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
<s> Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
<s> You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
<s> It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
<s> I don't think that's a cloud...
<s> Why does this sound so familiar?
<s> Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
<s> Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
<s> Stop, please! I don't know!
<s> It's perfectly safe. I promise.
<s> Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!
<s> NO, Thank God he has not.
<s> I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
<s> But there it is!...
<s> But... Inside, I have seen-
<s> I didn't say that.  I said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together." That's what I said.
<s> Wh... Where are we?
<s> What kind of signal?
<s> Okay, let's go.
<s> It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
<s> We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry
<s> Pedal to the metal...
<s> Commander?... Call me Laredo?
<s> Patience, Lt. . Patience.
<s> But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
<s> They always say that.
<s> Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
<s> You seem pleased by the prospect.
<s> It comes down to leaders.  If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die?  The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation.
<s> The army can survive without me.
<s> While they're strung out?
<s> Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.
<s> The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
<s> Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
<s> It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.
<s> To learn to shoot cannon?
<s> I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
<s> Is this a coup?  Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don't agree?
<s> But it's more than just that, am I right?
<s> As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
<s> I don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  And, if he's popular with his men...
<s> I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
<s> It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
<s> We already have black soldiers in our army...
<s> I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
<s> They help me understand why we fight.
<s> I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
<s> Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!
<s> I rode here, on my horse.
<s> My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
<s> That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
<s> Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
<s> We're leaving them?
<s> Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
<s> Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
<s> You know, I came back to Mount Vernon to retire.  I don't need to be in government.
<s> I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
<s> Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
<s> Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?
<s> Africa, of course.
<s> Slavers capture them and bring them here.
<s> It's stupid, of course.
<s> The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
<s> Well, we must be who we must be...
<s> Come here, Farrah...
<s> You spotted them, huh?
<s> Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
<s> I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
<s> I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
<s> Harry, let me answer that.
<s> That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
<s> She can't talk right now.
<s> Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
<s> Leo, I don't know.
<s> By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco.
<s> Who is this?
<s> Never heard of him.
<s> Or else use your fucking imagination.
<s> Ray. Look at me.
<s> Whatever you want, Ray.
<s> Ray Barboni. From Miami.
<s> Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
<s> I'm a producer.
<s> Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
<s> Harry, look at me.
<s> A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
<s> Who's the star?
<s> So what's the problem?
<s> So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
<s> Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
<s> Read it. It's a grabber.
<s> Never say anything unless you have to.
<s> I'm up twelve grand today.
<s> You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
<s> Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
<s> He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
<s> Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
<s> Don't go out of your way.
<s> And you think the movie business is any different?
<s> The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
<s> You don't like Martin much, do you?
<s> Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
<s> Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
<s> Are you going down?
<s> Go get your stuff.
<s> Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.
<s> Don't say a fuckin' word.
<s> What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
<s> Pick 'n' Save.
<s> He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
<s> Harry -
<s> I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
<s> They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
<s> Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
<s> She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
<s> Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
<s> Roger?
<s> I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
<s> Seen a lota movies.
<s> Why not?
<s> Yeah, yeah.
<s> How long to fix?
<s> Turbine rotor's shot.
<s> Man, it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.
<s> She take a radio?
<s> What, you think there's something funny about it?
<s> Then it happened before they scuttled her.
<s> It looks like it.
<s> The sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours.
<s> How about you Epps?
<s> Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
<s> And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
<s> If they knew what they were carrying.
<s> You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
<s> Conveniently enough for you.
<s> If money can buy what he wants.
<s> Right.
<s> Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
<s> Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
<s> Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
<s> I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
<s> It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
<s> We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
<s> Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?
<s> If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
<s> Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
<s> Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
<s> Hey.
<s> Victims of what?
<s> He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
<s> We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
<s> The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
<s> I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
<s> I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
<s> There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
<s> How's that?
<s> You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
<s> You're up late.
<s> Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
<s> Drink up then.
<s> A what?
<s> Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
<s> Fine with me.
<s> Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
<s> You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
<s> I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
<s> Nothing.
<s> Are you going to yell at me?
<s> Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
<s> Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
<s> Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
<s> It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.
<s> I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
<s> I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
<s> So what do you think?
<s> But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
<s> Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm almost done.
<s> Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
<s> This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
<s> Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
<s> Okay, okay!
<s> I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.
<s> What a little hosebag.
<s> He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
<s> I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."
<s> Somewhere downtown.
<s> You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
<s> Let's go hassle Josh.
<s> I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
<s> Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
<s> Everybody's too stupid!
<s> Yeah, thanks.
<s> I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
<s> I can't afford stuff like this right now.
<s> You're insane.
<s> It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
<s> That's all you're bringing?
<s> Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
<s> Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Well, we won't keep you.
<s> Shhh!
<s> Seymour does.
<s> Indian records?
<s> The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
<s> NO!!!
<s> Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...
<s> Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
<s> PLEASE? We have to!
<s> Fine, I'll go by myself then...
<s> I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
<s> I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
<s> Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
<s> What are you, a fry cook or something?
<s> What? Why?
<s> I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
<s> I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
<s> Really?
<s> Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
<s> Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time...
<s> I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
<s> So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
<s> What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
<s> FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
<s> That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
<s> Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
<s> I dunno, I...
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
<s> Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
<s> Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
<s> Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!
<s> Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
<s> Am I to take it you want to live?
<s> You never had it.
<s> -please- you needn't be so graphic-
<s> -I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
<s> Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.
<s> Shhh.
<s> -you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
<s> Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.
<s> John, it will not be easy.
<s> But you said they were always old.
<s> What did I do?
<s> It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
<s> Has it ever done that before?
<s> Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
<s> He doesn't. He needs nobody. But we have hunted many times...  ...he knows I am afraid of lions...
<s> Not even close.  What happened?
<s> You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
<s> Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
<s> Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
<s> Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
<s> Okay, that's no problem.
<s> I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.
<s> Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Peter, what about the bathtub?
<s> I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
<s> Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
<s> Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
<s> Finally came to your senses, huh?
<s> A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
<s> Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
<s> Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
<s> Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
<s> Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.
<s> Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
<s> Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
<s> Oh, sure, that sounds great.
<s> How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
<s> My pleasure.
<s> I know.
<s> Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
<s> Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
<s> I knew that.
<s> Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
<s> This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."
<s> I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
<s> Something good --
<s> You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
<s> Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.
<s> Who?  Just -- someone we know.
<s> This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
<s> Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
<s> She's new in town.
<s> Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.
<s> Now if you don't want to be the --  -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift, I suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal "Stabilize -- All Clear."
<s> No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.
<s> Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
<s> I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
<s> Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
<s> I am Zuul.
<s> So what do you think it was?
<s> Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
<s> Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
<s> You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
<s> Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
<s> Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
<s> Print is dead.
<s> I think it's the food of the future.
<s> Did you ever report it to anyone?
<s> The magic word is "please."
<s> Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
<s> I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
<s> Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
<s> What do you mean "bad?"
<s> What is it?
<s> Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
<s> I agree.
<s> Oh, shit!
<s> Full-stream with strogon pulse.
<s> No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
<s> We'd better adjust our streams.
<s> The storage facility blew.  This one ...  ... shut off the protection grid.
<s> It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
<s> What do I say?
<s> Ray, I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too.
<s> So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
<s> Where are you, Pete?
<s> The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
<s> No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
<s> Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
<s> If I may be so bold...
<s> Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
<s> Gladly Caesar.
<s> On what charge?
<s> Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
<s> Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
<s> That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
<s> Yes, because I know they'll read it.
<s> Yes!  The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate are over -- thanks to your father!  Now report to the Senate, Master Galen:  what is Marcus' state?
<s> The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
<s> The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
<s> You're hearing about somebody else.
<s> Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
<s> The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
<s> You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
<s> What deal?
<s> I can't let you do that.
<s> It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
<s> Can you stop that slaughter?!  Can you free these men?
<s> Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
<s> I killed too many barbarians.
<s> Chain him.
<s> Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
<s> Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
<s> You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
<s> I want nothing to do with the arena.
<s> No.
<s> I'm sorry I took you in there.
<s> I just want to tell you something.
<s> No.
<s> Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
<s> Yes. She had a husband and a son.
<s> Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
<s> Ah. Where?
<s> I thought he said by the monkey house.
<s> Here? In Berkeley?
<s> I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.
<s> Because -- I am.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
<s> Tomorrow?
<s> I just don't think it would...
<s> No, Benjamin.
<s> Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
<s> There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
<s> Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
<s> All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
<s> You heard me. Out of here.
<s> I want you out of here.
<s> Yes.
<s> Will you bring it in to me?
<s> -- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
<s> The Singleman party, sir?
<s> A room. I'd like a room, please.
<s> Right.
<s> What?
<s> What do you drink?
<s> Look -- I think I should be going --
<s> What?
<s> I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
<s> Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.
<s> Where is it?
<s> Oh. Hello. Hello.
<s> Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
<s> The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Is this -- what?
<s> If you want.
<s> I don't.
<s> We don't.
<s> No we don't.
<s> No.
<s> See if you can guess.
<s> Kind of.
<s> How do you think.
<s> Oh my God.
<s> Why not?
<s> I was just kidding around.
<s> Of course you did.
<s> You wouldn't.
<s> That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
<s> But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
<s> I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
<s> Very good, sir.
<s> Yes, but I'm afraid --
<s> What else?
<s> Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
<s> We haven't.
<s> About what?
<s> To be what?
<s> Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
<s> No. She doesn't know about it.
<s> Oh no.
<s> Oh yes.
<s> You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
<s> Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
<s> Can you look through the glass.
<s> I'd like to discuss this.
<s> I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
<s> You might find a bullet through that head...
<s> You're very funny --
<s> Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
<s> Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
<s> For tonight. 
<s> Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
<s> I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
<s> I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
<s> Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
<s> When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
<s> I don't want them now.
<s> I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
<s> I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
<s> Yes.
<s> For Vienna?
<s> No?
<s> They've brought me such good luck -- you --
<s> We could come to my room.
<s> No -- not at all.
<s> Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again... 
<s> No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone, Baron.
<s> How's the beautiful lady?
<s> No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
<s> That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
<s> Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
<s> No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
<s> Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
<s> Send his bags up to my room.
<s> What, Doctor?
<s> Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
<s> Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
<s> You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
<s> Oh, don't go.
<s> She's beautiful -- isn't she?
<s> I never danced before -- in public.
<s> You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
<s> Money!
<s> Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
<s> Later?
<s> I'm the stenographer.
<s> Moreover --
<s> My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
<s> Well?
<s> I understand perfectly.
<s> You think so?
<s> Exactly.
<s> We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
<s> You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
<s> What a session this has been.
<s> Why waste time -- it's getting late.
<s> Oh, yes, Suzette.
<s> You haven't time.
<s> What -- what is it? Last night...
<s> There was -- there was.
<s> Me?
<s> He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
<s> -- We must do something...
<s> Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself.  There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
<s> I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
<s> I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
<s> That.
<s> I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
<s> Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
<s> You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.
<s> I never fucked up before, Bobo.
<s> You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
<s> One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
<s> Well, make it stop!
<s> You know who I work for.
<s> I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
<s> Oh, sure. Fine.
<s> And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
<s> You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?
<s> You don't have the stomach for it.
<s> Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.
<s> Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
<s> No. That was the point.
<s> Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
<s> Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
<s> She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
<s> And Myra's stuff?
<s> Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
<s> No.
<s> It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
<s> My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
<s> All? It ain't bad.
<s> I just do what the doctor says, babe.
<s> Mama!
<s> I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
<s> And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
<s> You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
<s> Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?
<s> Thank you.
<s> You up to it now?
<s> Not many.
<s> Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
<s> Happy to see you looking so good.
<s> They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
<s> Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
<s> The cemetery...
<s> Charming.
<s> Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
<s> Detective...
<s> Doesn't look good.
<s> Betcha' didn't predict that.
<s> You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
<s> No.
<s> John...
<s> Call me Laurie, will ya?
<s> Where'd you get it?
<s> Can I come in?
<s> Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
<s> Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
<s> Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
<s> Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
<s> Then they can watch.
<s> Okay ... But just for tonight.
<s> I promise.
<s> What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
<s> No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
<s> Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
<s> Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
<s> Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --
<s> But surely Rogers isn't --
<s> I'll meet you over there.
<s> Samhain.
<s> Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
<s> At least!
<s> The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
<s> Go home!
<s> I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.
<s> What's this?
<s> Maybe it's time you got out.
<s> The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
<s> I forget mine for years on end.
<s> You actually sold insurance!
<s> I just want one true adventure before I die.
<s> You're making a joke.
<s> It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
<s> Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things!
<s> For what?
<s> We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
<s> It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
<s> You're hollow, like a woman.
<s> He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
<s> Out!
<s> Dr. Woodly.
<s> They were in the same creative writing class.
<s> Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
<s> No, no, no, no, no.
<s> Sir?
<s> Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
<s> Will you go to bed?
<s> Damn.
<s> We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?
<s> Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!`
<s> I'm talking to you gently now.
<s> I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
<s> The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
<s> Situation.
<s> Have some.
<s> Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
<s> It's so--so stark.
<s> You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
<s> Ram it up your ass!
<s> Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
<s> They don't have to feel like slaves.
<s> I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
<s> The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
<s> I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
<s> Yes.
<s> No you're not!
<s> Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
<s> If he wants to go.
<s> I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
<s> How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
<s> I plan to live one hundred years!
<s> Gentlemen--that's nice.
<s> It's always locked.
<s> He's dead, you know.
<s> Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
<s> Ahh--then she's still alive.
<s> I came back.
<s> I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
<s> Are you've seen it work cures?
<s> You haven't heard me yet.
<s> Oooooo.  That hurt.
<s> King Arthur.
<s> Get up.
<s> I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
<s> I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
<s> Premature ejaculation.
<s> Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
<s> All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
<s> He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
<s> You're married!  You've already got a husband!
<s> A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
<s> I was afraid to ask.
<s> I didn't know that.
<s> I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
<s> How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
<s> He isn't any friend of Father.
<s> That's something I suppose.
<s> How nice.
<s> He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
<s> We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?
<s> Take plenty of cigars.
<s> What?
<s> It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
<s> Paul's only twelve years old.
<s> He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged.
<s> Penelope!  We're late!
<s> Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
<s> Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve, let him rage.  There has never been a funeral for his father.
<s> Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
<s> No.
<s> But is she, has...
<s> What are you doing?
<s> We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
<s> I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
<s> Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
<s> What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
<s> Wait?
<s> How many weeks?
<s> Overpowering?
<s> Yeah.
<s> You know her?
<s> Last I heard he went to San Diego.
<s> You're not a film producer, are you?
<s> No.
<s> You don't understand shit.
<s> Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
<s> You really believe all that?
<s> Where does he live.
<s> But then you'll forget about me.
<s> Who's paying you?
<s> And better?
<s> They are?
<s> Hmm.
<s> Get out!
<s> Just leave me alone.
<s> They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
<s> Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
<s> That's not true, Mr...?
<s> That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for.
<s> Where does he hang out?
<s> Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
<s> Is this with a girl named Kristen?
<s> If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper.
<s> To anybody.
<s> Who's that?
<s> Well, he can just fuck himself.
<s> Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
<s> Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
<s> I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
<s> Out!
<s> Where are the papers?
<s> Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
<s> I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
<s> Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
<s> You're welcome.  Did you know him?
<s> Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
<s> Nice to meet you.
<s> And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
<s> Thank you, but I really have to go.
<s> Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
<s> Certainly a new experience for me.
<s> Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
<s> Is he all right?
<s> But I don't play anything.
<s> I like you, Maude.
<s> Pray? No.  I communicate. 
<s> Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
<s> Really. Just put it there, Harold.
<s> Here.
<s> They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
<s> But why now?
<s> To whom?
<s> Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on "Sunshine." Dore is my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here.
<s> No. My uncle.
<s> Like a tea ceremony?
<s> A rough estimate.
<s> Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
<s> During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
<s> I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
<s> To pit your own life against another.
<s> Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
<s> Eh, yes, ma'm.
<s> I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
<s> The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
<s> Kyle, you don't have...
<s> You were ALL human!
<s> You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
<s> Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
<s> From where??!!
<s> No. It's not.
<s> I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
<s> Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
<s> That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
<s> This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
<s> Anung-un-Rama...
<s> In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
<s> Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
<s> That's right, Stud, hold me down.
<s> Shh! Just a second.
<s> Not hungry.
<s> No. Myers is taking me.
<s> What -- ?
<s> What?
<s> We're leaving.
<s> Sure.
<s> You did this before, right?
<s> I could lead you right to him. You could take him back to Hell instead of me.
<s> I don't remember.
<s> What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.
<s> That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
<s> I'm very happy.
<s> Tell me who you are.
<s> Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
<s> His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
<s> Ssh!
<s> What do you want me to do.
<s> Who?
<s> I have to see my father.
<s> The best part of ten years.
<s> He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
<s> No. I'm not.
<s> Why not?
<s> Larry....
<s> I'm here.
<s> Can I get you anything?
<s> No. I'll do it.
<s> Please. I can't bear it...
<s> Not much.
<s> I... suppose so, yes.
<s> Let's keep it that way, shall we?
<s> I prefer the floor.
<s> Am I?
<s> Wait a moment --
<s> Well come over, will you? See the place?
<s> You like?
<s> Is Julia here?
<s> Maybe you should give it some time.
<s> She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
<s> Just trying to get my apartment in order.
<s> As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
<s> Will you GO, damn you?
<s> 'Bye.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
<s> Well what's the point in that?
<s> Oh, so what's the point then?
<s> What do you mean, "what?"
<s> Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
<s> -- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
<s> Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
<s> Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
<s> No, you can't.
<s> Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
<s> On Clark Street!
<s> Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
<s> Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
<s> No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
<s> I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
<s> So.  Is now a good time?
<s> OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
<s> Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
<s> Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
<s> I want a tape.
<s> We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
<s> I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
<s> We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.
<s> I thought I could give you a lift back.
<s> Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
<s> Is what better?  Better than what?
<s> Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
<s> I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
<s> No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
<s> It's me.
<s> That bad, eh?
<s> Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
<s> Want to know what, exactly?
<s> It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
<s> Okay.
<s> Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?
<s> Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
<s> Fair enough.
<s> I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
<s> You called this morning?
<s> Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --
<s> -- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
<s> God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
<s> Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
<s> Yes.  You?
<s> Whiskey.
<s> I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
<s> God, you ask a lot of questions.
<s> And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
<s> Right.
<s> Well call her mother.
<s> Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
<s> Naw.  Those are for us.
<s> Go to hell.
<s> Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
<s> Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
<s> It's my birthday.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Why?
<s> I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
<s> The boy _died_?
<s> Basil the II.
<s> Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
<s> I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
<s> I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright.
<s> You?
<s> No one knows you're here?
<s> You're a fool.
<s> Yes.
<s> A factor of age.
<s> What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
<s> Come here, Brenna.
<s> The inheritance.
<s> I'm just curious.
<s> You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
<s> All I need is for you to check the name.
<s> It's that important?
<s> Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.
<s> You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
<s> What are you doing man?
<s> I was nearly killed.
<s> You know me home.  Me name.
<s> This can't be.
<s> Go to hell.
<s> And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
<s> So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
<s> Do what you must.
<s> Certainly not me.
<s> Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
<s> Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
<s> Kahn?
<s> Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
<s> Offered the Pope one of his whores.
<s> How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
<s> I've had a few more concerns.
<s> Leave her out of this.
<s> Should I care?
<s> I've got all the time in the world.  Except right now.  If you will excuse me, Lieutenant.
<s> Same.
<s> A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
<s> The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
<s> Open this door!
<s> Hello, Bensinger.
<s> Yes, wasn't it?
<s> Hello, Bruce...
<s> Oh, yes. Here it is.
<s> Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
<s> How?
<s> Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
<s> Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
<s> And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
<s> Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
<s> Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
<s> She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
<s> The money? Why?
<s> Say, I want to be sure, too!
<s> Out of the mouths of babes.
<s> What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
<s> You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
<s> Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
<s> What's the matter?
<s> Keep away --
<s> Please! Will you just --
<s> Where'd you meet this man?
<s> He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
<s> Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
<s> You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
<s> I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
<s> You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
<s> Hold on a minute.
<s> Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
<s> Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
<s> All right, Walter.
<s> Where's Butch?
<s> Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
<s> What did you do with her?
<s> Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
<s> Is this the Community Hospital?
<s> Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
<s> Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
<s> Murder, uh?
<s> I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy.
<s> It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
<s> Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
<s> Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
<s> Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
<s> You know you did!
<s> What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
<s> Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
<s> Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
<s> First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
<s> The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
<s> I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
<s> What have you got, Hildy?
<s> Now, where is he?
<s> I can't complain.
<s> Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
<s> I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
<s> Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.
<s> That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
<s> I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
<s> We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'.
<s> I did.  Hold the wire.
<s> So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
<s> Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.
<s> And up a dime.
<s> Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
<s> Huh?
<s> From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
<s> I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
<s> "Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
<s> Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
<s> No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
<s> Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?
<s> They're not human!
<s> Wait a minute, Mollie.
<s> Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
<s> Shut up, you!
<s> I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
<s> The reprieve for Earl Williams.
<s> I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
<s> No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
<s> It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job.  Take it away, Fred Wilson!
<s> Look out where you're aiming, will you?
<s> Come on, fellas.
<s> -- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
<s> I give that marriage six months.
<s> Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.
<s> No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.
<s> Why?
<s> No, she didn't.
<s> Yes.
<s> Bugger off.
<s> Bugger off, you bloody sod.
<s> It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
<s> ...and six...
<s> The sodding water table.
<s> They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
<s> Please yourself.
<s> Kiss me Hardy.
<s> And absent bridegrooms!
<s> We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
<s> Oh, that.
<s> Fair enough.  The river.
<s> Out.
<s> It's not. It's happening to me.
<s> How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
<s> Grace!
<s> We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
<s> Really, that's a long time.
<s> Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.
<s> OK.
<s> Come on.
<s> You're welcome.
<s> Whoopie fucking doo.
<s> Yeah, I'll do something.
<s> Great story Goober, how much?
<s> How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
<s> Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
<s> Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
<s> I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
<s> Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
<s> I'll help ya.
<s> Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
<s> And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
<s> Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
<s> I know, this is fucking nuts.
<s> We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
<s> There's not enough room.
<s> Quiet.
<s> I hear ya.
<s> Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
<s> I don't know... about half an hour.
<s> Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
<s> I don't doubt that.
<s> Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
<s> Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
<s> I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
<s> Oh, alright... I guess I can trust you... being a man of the law and all.
<s> That's it?
<s> Dr. Satan?
<s> Christ, you know it's crazy...  I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?
<s> Aw, fuck.
<s> Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
<s> Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms.
<s> Right...  ...come on.
<s> Gabrielle.
<s> I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
<s> When you were a little French girl?
<s> Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
<s> Shh.
<s> Urgh.
<s> Where do we look for little lost Puff?
<s> What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together.
<s> Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Really?
<s> Shut up, you.
<s> No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do.
<s> You've got to respect that.
<s> How's it going?
<s> Paper or cloth?
<s> We are animals after all.
<s> I like you, too, Nathan.
<s> Yes.
<s> Good. Making progress.
<s> Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
<s> ...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
<s> How come?
<s> Oook. Oook.
<s> I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
<s> Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
<s> Unka unka unka unka unka.
<s> I have to talk. Is that okay?
<s> I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
<s> Yep.
<s> You want a chaser?
<s> Check!
<s> We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
<s> It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
<s> All I want's the money.
<s> Good, good.
<s> It's possible.
<s> Two.
<s> Yeah. Sure, sure.
<s> I got drunk.
<s> To do what?
<s> Why?
<s> There are places. I'll scuffle around.
<s> Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
<s> Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
<s> You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
<s> I been thinking.
<s> Well, I win sometimes.
<s> How're the hands?
<s> And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
<s> No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
<s> Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
<s> Give me a drink, will ya?
<s> What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
<s> Yeah. Just like that.
<s> Would you like to come out tonight?
<s> I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
<s> Oh no, nothing for me.
<s> Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
<s> Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
<s> Oh man, you're way out of our league.
<s> Yes.
<s> Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
<s> Then why go to the bus station?
<s> Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
<s> No.
<s> Come here.
<s> I'm getting treatments right here.
<s> Yes, I'm glad.
<s> Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
<s> No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
<s> Leave now.
<s> I'll be up later.
<s> Well, what's the matter?
<s> Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!
<s> You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota Fats is the best in the country out where I come from.
<s> Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
<s> Game's over, Eddie.
<s> Thousand dollars a game.
<s> So do you, Fast Eddie.
<s> My name is Robert.
<s> Listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could find some way to --
<s> Dark and large.  With vines -- no, not vines.  Not alive.
<s> Yes.
<s> Have you looked inside?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
<s> Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
<s> Virginia...?
<s> Please.
<s> That's fine.
<s> I guess you could say that.
<s> Round back.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
<s> That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.
<s> Was there anything over the hill?
<s> I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
<s> He was upset with moving, I believe.
<s> No.
<s> I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
<s> I want you to leave with us. Right now.
<s> He's a good man.
<s> We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
<s> Punched the President? Oh my god.
<s> More than likely.
<s> So sue me.
<s> Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
<s> Huh? Oh, good, good.
<s> Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.
<s> The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
<s> This, pops, is every phone book in America.
<s> College nickname.
<s> It's perfect the line is busy?
<s> You can do that?
<s> Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
<s> Great.
<s> But Mr. President...
<s> And our troops here?
<s> I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us.
<s> It had been deemed classified.
<s> Well, er... it's slowing down.
<s> He's doing a good job.
<s> Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
<s> Yes, I am.
<s> Butt-munch.
<s> You know how I like to make a big entrance.
<s> He's my angel.
<s> No. Exotic.
<s> Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
<s> I thought you didn't recognize me.
<s> I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
<s> Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
<s> Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
<s> Above American soil?
<s> Yes.
<s> Here... now.
<s> Die.
<s> Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
<s> You've got it!
<s> The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
<s> I'm going after Dad.
<s> What?
<s> Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
<s> Yes?
<s> You had it? You didn't trust me!
<s> It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
<s> Don't know. Think of something.
<s> I can reach it. I can reach it...
<s> Out!
<s> And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
<s> Head for the fireplace!
<s> What about Marcus?
<s> I was the next man.
<s> Junior...
<s> I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
<s> After you, Junior.
<s> Come on -- come on!
<s> My soul is prepared. How's yours?
<s> The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
<s> This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
<s> No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province.
<s> Finally!
<s> We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
<s> Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me -- my god, I've to get ready!
<s> When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
<s> And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
<s> Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.
<s> Just a statue.
<s> Why?
<s> Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
<s> I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.
<s> Who cares? Where's that diamond!
<s> No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead.  Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?
<s> The old man saw it in a dream.
<s> That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too...
<s> Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
<s> It's pulling me deeper!
<s> I know the feeling...
<s> Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
<s> Maybe he likes older women.
<s> I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
<s> What -- the bug?
<s> A what?!
<s> It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.
<s> Willie, come on!
<s> Don't do that.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> I just got here.
<s> Where are we?
<s> What street?
<s> ...I need to make a phone call.
<s> No.
<s> I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
<s> Kill myself.
<s> Yep.
<s> Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
<s> Then what are you stopping for?
<s> Can't see a Goddamn thi..
<s> No. Don't tell the guards.
<s> I don't know. I don't want to find out.
<s> We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
<s> Don't know.
<s> You are in trouble. Now do it.
<s> You'll be me.
<s> To the hotel. To register.
<s> What are you looking at?
<s> What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
<s> Not blue enough.
<s> You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
<s> That place. By the window.
<s> You can't listen. You can't watch either.
<s> What if she says something important?
<s> Run, stupid!
<s> Just stay here and rest.
<s> Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
<s> It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
<s> I told you, I have a feeling...
<s> A hard left. A hard left.
<s> Never mind, just say it.
<s> I've got an idea.
<s> The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
<s> Losing power. The laser drained it.
<s> JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
<s> I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
<s> Who's our little man?
<s> We insist.
<s> Oh...that's okay.
<s> Do what?
<s> Remember what?
<s> I don't know Who.
<s> Been complaning of hallucinations.
<s> Just give me the keys.
<s> Sir?
<s> You did. JOE No I didn't. You said   something first.
<s> ...right here too.
<s> Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
<s> ...Rene.
<s> Me still. They left you alone?
<s> Why?
<s> ...Naw. Made that up.
<s> Hires you for what?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
<s> I'm just on vacation.
<s> He must be a good friend.
<s> Ryuji and Gruner.
<s> It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
<s> Beats me.
<s> You coming along?
<s> I can't fly it.
<s> Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
<s> Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?
<s> Why are you on to him?
<s> ...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
<s> Tear it apart?
<s> Yes, baby?
<s> You got a deal. 
<s> C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
<s> End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
<s> No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
<s> What caliber is your gun?
<s> Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
<s> If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
<s> Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
<s> "Mike?"
<s> And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
<s> Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard... for everyone else...
<s> Catch you later.
<s> Call me back in ten.
<s> Don't you have to be at the office?
<s> Yes, it's on the stove...
<s> Can we talk about this when I get back?
<s> "60 Minutes"?
<s> Hello? Yeah...
<s> They're killing the Wigand interview...
<s> They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
<s> I'm alone on this...
<s> You're not listening.  Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
<s> Alright.
<s> What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
<s> Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
<s> Okay. Thank you.
<s> ...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
<s> You eating with us?
<s> Hardly new news.
<s> What's this?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
<s> Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
<s> Far as you go where?
<s> To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
<s> Why am I gonna mention your name?
<s> No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell.  But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people.
<s> The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
<s> Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
<s> I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
<s> No.
<s> You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
<s> They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it.
<s> ABC...?
<s> And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
<s> I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
<s> I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
<s> Yeah. Yeah, I will.
<s> A delivery device for nicotine.
<s> "The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
<s> Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...
<s> Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
<s> When should we do this?
<s> Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
<s> I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
<s> Chapter and verse.
<s> I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
<s> They hate each other --
<s> Here. Got pictures.
<s> She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
<s> Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.
<s> Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
<s> Is that... one person?
<s> Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
<s> Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
<s> Got any symptoms?
<s> What?
<s> Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
<s> I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
<s> I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.
<s> Oh boy. If he only knew.
<s> Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
<s> What does your lawyer think?
<s> Have you ever been married, Miles?
<s> You just haven't met the right person.
<s> He wants a reconciliation.
<s> Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
<s> So I hear. Is that all?
<s> You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You --  sound like my mother.
<s> Miles?
<s> You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
<s> I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
<s> I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
<s> No. Don't stop.
<s> No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
<s> Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
<s> Boy. Boy, oh boy.
<s> Do you want to sleep on it?
<s> In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
<s> Hello Marylin.
<s> I love you. I want to have your baby.
<s> May I come in?
<s> The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
<s> You can't prove anything.
<s> You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
<s> But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
<s> Oh, God!
<s> So where are you now?
<s> Shit.
<s> They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
<s> No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
<s> I want to be exposed.
<s> Yes?
<s> Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
<s> My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
<s> My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
<s> Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
<s> Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
<s> Video.
<s> I am very sorry.
<s> Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
<s> Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
<s> Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
<s> Maybe next time.
<s> I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 
<s> Yes, sir?
<s> I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for
<s> Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
<s> I'll get it annulled.
<s> He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
<s> Oh, no.
<s> Why? Do you know him? 
<s> You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
<s> I suppose so.
<s> You've made that quite evidentwith all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
<s> Sock her!
<s> Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that
<s> Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye. 
<s> I haven't the slightest idea.
<s> Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
<s> Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
<s> You win!
<s> Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
<s> Why, you ungrateful brat!
<s> I found it on the seat.
<s> You must have me confused with
<s> I didn't ask for your advice. 
<s> If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. 
<s> Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
<s> Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
<s> Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
<s> What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  Youyou had it pressed.
<s> Outside!
<s> I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
<s> What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
<s> No. No. It's too good a story.
<s> One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
<s> Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
<s> That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
<s> There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
<s> I refuse to resign!
<s> Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old womana trip like this.
<s> At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
<s> I'm following you.
<s> Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
<s> was so scaredthat it scared
<s> No. But I've got a penknife. 
<s> There's no end to your accomplishments.
<s> Oh, no!
<s> Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
<s> Why not? I'm hungry.
<s> A black eye. 
<s> I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
<s> Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
<s> Maybe.  Suresure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd  Yeah, but where you going to find hersomebody that's realsomebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.
<s> I love you.
<s> I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself.  Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you.  Oh, Peter
<s> Why, you bully. I believe you would.
<s> Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
<s> Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
<s> Why, he'll be back.
<s> Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
<s> Ain't gonna wait a minute.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Wait a minute, GordonI
<s> Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
<s> When you sober upcome in and see me.
<s> Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
<s> Yeah, you'll have to git .
<s> I'd like to sit with myuhwifeif you don't mind. 
<s> That's right.
<s> Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, seeand
<s> Orange, New Jersey.
<s> No.
<s> Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
<s> Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
<s> Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
<s> You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
<s> Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
<s> Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
<s> And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
<s> Go on, Willie.
<s> It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing.  It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue.  There's no chain of evidence, Bill.  And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository?  One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - "a patsy".  Take it at face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here.  He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, "O.H. Lee" to rent the room, right?  What's in a name, right?  In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?
<s> So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
<s> No, I did not.
<s> Calm down, Dave, what?
<s> Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays for keeps...  I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.  I taught him everything.  A "wanna be," y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency fucked him.  Just like they're gonna fuck me.
<s> Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
<s> Did you bag any geese on this trip?
<s> If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
<s> Hi, Freckle Face.
<s> Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
<s> No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
<s> I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
<s> Goddamn!  They put Oswald together from Day One!  Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board.  Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems.  You got the word "microdots" in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination.  Does the real Oswald know he's been put together?  Who knows.  It doesn't matter, does it?  He's a low level spy, he doesn't know who he really works for...
<s> It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then.  I call him Smedley.  His real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering "Frankie!" .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?
<s> Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
<s> Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
<s> That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
<s> Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
<s> I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
<s> Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
<s> I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything.
<s> I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
<s> I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
<s> Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
<s> No.
<s> The Warren Commission call him?
<s> You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
<s> Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
<s> Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
<s> I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
<s> Yes.
<s> No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
<s> I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now.
<s> His name?
<s> Anything more specific, Jack?  It's important.
<s> You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when...
<s> Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
<s> I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
<s> The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
<s> Yes.
<s> No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
<s> Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
<s> I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
<s> I'll call her.
<s> Three years.
<s> She almost sounds scared.
<s> The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
<s> I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
<s> Take your time.
<s> Help you get Ordell Robbie.
<s> Can you do it or not?
<s> What's her name?
<s> She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
<s> We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
<s> Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
<s> Ordell pick up his bond?
<s> It was the other guy who busted me.
<s> Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
<s> I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
<s> I don't care.
<s> He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
<s> If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
<s> Which one?
<s> What if I've figured a way?
<s> Do you think they bought it?
<s> Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
<s> Set him up.
<s> Why?
<s> We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?
<s> Did you tell him you were leaving?
<s> I didn't say you did.
<s> You'll get over that.
<s> Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
<s> With the prior? You could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge. You want to think about it? You got two minutes before we're up.
<s> Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.
<s> It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
<s> Can I smoke?
<s> We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.
<s> What's her story?
<s> Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
<s> You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
<s> You'd take a polygraph on it?
<s> I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie.
<s> So what happens now?
<s> Do you think I took some of that money?
<s> Gimme one anyway.
<s> This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
<s> That coke was yours, wasn't it?
<s> Keep it between us girls?
<s> The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
<s> I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
<s> That's a good idea.
<s> I can do that.
<s> Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
<s> She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
<s> Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
<s> Detroit.
<s> I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
<s> Uh-huh?
<s> We shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around!
<s> Fuck you. I can carry it.
<s> Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
<s> Who's your partner?
<s> Then what?
<s> Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
<s> I dunno.
<s> You're outside?
<s> I'm in my underwear.
<s> Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
<s> He's a big one. You two tight?
<s> House.
<s> Did the police contact you?
<s> The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
<s> Was she?
<s> Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
<s> Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
<s> And where's Jackie?
<s> By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
<s> Yeah.
<s> What isn't happening?
<s> No, thanks.
<s> Oh God!
<s> What do you want from me?
<s> Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
<s> Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
<s> War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
<s> How do you know?
<s> What can I tell you?
<s> She talk about the boys?
<s> She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
<s> I know.
<s> I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
<s> See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
<s> Carlson? Is he new here?
<s> Jacob Singer.
<s> That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
<s> No. Don't move me.
<s> Where is the lamp?
<s> If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
<s> Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
<s> Jezzie, I can't see.
<s> No. The little one.
<s> They're weird names.
<s> Jake, you are never out of your head!
<s> Look at her face. A real bitch.
<s> Why do you bring her up?
<s> I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
<s> Where's Della? Bring her here?
<s> Get your clothes off!
<s> Lie down!
<s> What?
<s> He did? When?
<s> What? What do you mean?
<s> What's he talking about?
<s> I can do anything I want.
<s> It might be for me.
<s> Me neither.
<s> No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
<s> Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
<s> What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
<s> You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
<s> I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
<s> I'm tired.
<s> I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
<s> You know who I am.
<s> Long time ago.
<s> If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
<s> Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.
<s> You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
<s> Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
<s> I'm awake?
<s> Of course it is. What else could it be?
<s> I need to see you.
<s> Count 'em on one hand.
<s> You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
<s> You can't talk in Brownsville?
<s> Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
<s> I don't know what to do.
<s> God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
<s> Oh God. I know. I know.
<s> Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
<s> Bring it in.
<s> Punk?
<s> Yes it does.
<s> What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
<s> If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
<s> Sergeant? We thought you were...
<s> Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
<s> What?!
<s> And you said high school was boring.
<s> The hull's imploding!
<s> Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
<s> Two more charges to go.
<s> And now we're all out of it.
<s> I am an expert!
<s> That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
<s> My job.
<s> Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
<s> You got that right.
<s> You just keep an eye out.
<s> What?
<s> Fuckin A...
<s> Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
<s> I'm pulling, damnit!
<s> We have to get off this ship.
<s> Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
<s> Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
<s> Not so bad.
<s> I think I had some when I was eight.
<s> I think so, why?
<s> I know you.
<s> She needs a little time.
<s> Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
<s> GO, GO, GO!
<s> Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
<s> You're leaving me here alone?
<s> Later.
<s> Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
<s> Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
<s> Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
<s> But?!!
<s> We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
<s> We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
<s> You wanna die?
<s> They can deal with this sort of thing.
<s> 4You're not going anywhere.
<s> You're crazy!
<s> What have I done?! Idiots.
<s> Sure but what good will that do?
<s> Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
<s> Sure, Dad.
<s> You got it.
<s> Tattoo. Had it taken off.
<s> Full throttle! To port!
<s> Thank you.
<s> Can you do that?
<s> Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
<s> I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...
<s> I don't know if I can do that without a...
<s> You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
<s> About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
<s> Rogue?
<s> A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
<s> I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
<s> I wish it would rain...
<s> Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
<s> Is that a boat?
<s> Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
<s> Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
<s> Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!
<s> I don't know...
<s> What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
<s> Also, I think I'm in love with you.
<s> Yup.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
<s> No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
<s> You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
<s> First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
<s> It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
<s> Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
<s> No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
<s> Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
<s> You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
<s> Oh.
<s> '93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
<s> Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
<s> That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
<s> Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
<s> Frankly, this looks kind of stupid.
<s> You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
<s> Why? What the big deal?
<s> I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
<s> Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
<s> What are you?
<s> I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
<s> I heard that was you.
<s> Vanessa, right?
<s> Sure.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Your name, please?
<s> Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
<s> I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
<s> You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
<s> I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
<s> I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.
<s> No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
<s> Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
<s> I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
<s> I'm staying pregnant, Le.
<s> What?
<s> I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
<s> Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.
<s> Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
<s> Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
<s> Don't mock me.
<s> Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
<s> Adele for god sake please lis...
<s> So you don't do any of those things.
<s> I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
<s> Could I try that?
<s> It's a portfolio of my work.
<s> Took 'em all.
<s> What's Early been in jail for?
<s> Almost.
<s> I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
<s> Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
<s> Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.
<s> I don't want to talk about it.
<s> How do you know that?
<s> Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
<s> What are you going to do?
<s> No.
<s> He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
<s> ...You're hurting me...
<s> You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
<s> I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
<s> Who are you?
<s> Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
<s> With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
<s> Yes!
<s> You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
<s> You think he's got any herb?
<s> A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
<s> Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
<s> Who?
<s> Yeah. She's only 13.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Nothen' B.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
<s> Is it cold?
<s> You have?
<s> Come on.
<s> I like you too.
<s> Do you care about me?
<s> Bang up stuff.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No.
<s> What?
<s> You're OK?
<s> And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
<s> I know.
<s> No, I didn't bleed.
<s> That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
<s> I only did it once and...
<s> No. I just gotta go find him.
<s> Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
<s> Whah is dissdee?
<s> Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
<s> Hi Telly. Where you been?
<s> Four-thirty in the morning?
<s> Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What kind of problem?
<s> It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
<s> You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
<s> What?
<s> What do you want?
<s> I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
<s> No, I need the original note.
<s> Homesearchers.
<s> I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
<s> Local?
<s> He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
<s> You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
<s> Who is this?
<s> You're not going to tell me that.
<s> I know what I said!  She looks just like...
<s> You're not playing very well.  There are clues all around you and you keep missing them.
<s> Then call them!
<s> I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
<s> If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
<s> Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
<s> Very good.
<s> If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
<s> You told me.  When you called you said she was in the other room.  Drop the knife.
<s> New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
<s> Fuck off!
<s> Nice meeting you.
<s> My cheering section.
<s> No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio.
<s> Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
<s> I'd say at least eighteen hours.
<s> And this Jeremy--
<s> Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
<s> Anything else?
<s> We're going to work on the message.
<s> To my room and then I went for a walk.
<s> Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
<s> On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
<s> I want to be the best I can.
<s> Mate in five.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> Yes.
<s> When I was very young.
<s> It is.
<s> Getting too hot in here for you?
<s> I can't right now.  I've got a game.
<s> Another kind of game?
<s> This isn't a game.
<s> How can you look at it so clinically?
<s> Why?
<s> No.  You were talking about chess.
<s> The line was busy.  I'll try again.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Then why are you backing up?
<s> I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
<s> Of course not.
<s> You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
<s> If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
<s> No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
<s> You must move away from the Center.
<s> Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast.
<s> Does the Queen live?
<s> But there is another entrance to this place.
<s> Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
<s> Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
<s> The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
<s> I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
<s> I was hoping I might be your friend.
<s> <u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
<s> How did you know I had sons?
<s> Not sleepy, either?
<s> I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you.
<s> We must try to get horses.
<s> What kind of friend do you think I am?
<s> Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
<s> I am Quell.
<s> We'll meet you at the inn.
<s> No.
<s> I ...  ... am Titch.
<s> I only want one.
<s> Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
<s> If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death.
<s> And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
<s> Then he will die!
<s> We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
<s> Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
<s> Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
<s> Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
<s> Where is he? My son.
<s> ...What?
<s> Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
<s> Good.
<s> Huh... 500 meters?
<s> Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
<s> I killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... I left nothing for you!
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> No, you can't go out.
<s> ...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
<s> Mathilda?!
<s> ...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
<s> Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
<s> You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
<s> I love you so much, Leon.
<s> ...Yes.
<s> Yeah, what?
<s> It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
<s> Huh? That's smart!
<s> Huh? Why?
<s> Can I sit on the stairways now?
<s> Where?
<s> Why am I such an authority?
<s> It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
<s> No it's not.
<s> If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
<s> Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan.
<s> I'm completing the walk.  I'm almost there.
<s> Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
<s> Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
<s> You need a ride, Preacher?
<s> We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
<s> It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
<s> Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
<s> Then why?
<s> I've changed my mind.
<s> You can change.
<s> He's plastered.
<s> When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
<s> Yes.
<s> If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
<s> By car right?
<s> Mammoth.
<s> I told you.
<s> I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
<s> Why know?
<s> It's mine to risk.
<s> Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?
<s> Oh, that's not mine.
<s> You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.
<s> Forty-seven years.
<s> What?  Who are you?
<s> Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
<s> No alcohol?
<s> Water.
<s> We can go to one if you'd prefer.
<s> Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
<s> Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
<s> Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
<s> Are you serious.
<s> No, I can't have dinner with you.
<s> Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
<s> Is that really what you want to ask me?
<s> Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
<s> Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
<s> Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
<s> There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
<s> What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
<s> So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
<s> No?
<s> I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
<s> Oh, and what did you do?
<s> That's impressive. How did you do that?
<s> Yes... I'll give you that.
<s> One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
<s> I want this, Sera. I need this!
<s> I've been all right.
<s> Yuri... are you...
<s> I have a 4.0.
<s> Who could better understand than me?
<s> Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
<s> Thank you!
<s> Is everything okay?
<s> Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
<s> I'm a man who knows what I want.
<s> No, she was crying her eyes out.
<s> Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six- carat on her bony, unpolished finger.
<s> What'd you do?
<s> She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate-looking.
<s> No.
<s> No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
<s> I'm so happy for you!
<s> Relation?
<s> Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
<s> Yes, he is.
<s> I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
<s> Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --
<s> I wasn't gonna --
<s> Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
<s> She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
<s> But maybe it is --
<s> Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
<s> Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
<s> Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
<s> Oh, my God!!
<s> I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
<s> I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
<s> Absolutely!
<s> You should. Do you have a resume?
<s> She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing!
<s> She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
<s> You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
<s> No.
<s> Harvard. Law school.
<s> Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
<s> Really?
<s> It's not a Theta --
<s> Then we smash 'em?
<s> Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
<s> Purely a precaution...
<s> I doubt the faeries will admire their beauty... Come, this will be fun to watch.
<s> To finish last evening's delightful work.
<s> Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
<s> I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
<s> I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
<s> We're both of us damned, my beauty.
<s> Do it now!
<s> Or looked so beautiful...
<s> Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
<s> Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
<s> Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged.
<s> Didn't you now?  Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
<s> Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
<s> It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
<s> Will you lead me to her?
<s> Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
<s> Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
<s> I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
<s> Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
<s> You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
<s> Better we eat him than the other way round.
<s> Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad.
<s> Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
<s> We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
<s> What know you of fields of war?
<s> Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
<s> Something the matter?
<s> Be gentle with them, Jack.  They only march to please you.  Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.
<s> It bodes evil.
<s> Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
<s> Never mind.  Just do it!  Retrieve the arrows somehow.
<s> Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
<s> It doesn't matter.
<s> ... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
<s> I don't... understand.
<s> Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
<s> Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
<s> Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
<s> Blackheart.  Aptly named.
<s> I'll go search for it.
<s> I'm not its master.
<s> Shhh!
<s> To fetch your napkin.
<s> I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
<s> Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
<s> Sunlight... It destroys him.
<s> I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
<s> Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
<s> Princess?  I know of no princess.
<s> Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
<s> Only that?
<s> Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
<s> And am I not fair?
<s> Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
<s> The Black Baron, you say?
<s> Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
<s> You follow.
<s> You've been inside?
<s> What are you doing?
<s> I guess it depends on what you give up on.
<s> He's here.  Check the bathroom.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> You'd better call and cancel.
<s> Who are all these people?
<s> He seems lonely.
<s> Your dad's really gonna build his house?
<s> Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
<s> Why?
<s> Not if what he left me was real.
<s> Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
<s> If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
<s> Will he talk to me?
<s> He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
<s> A violation?
<s> We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
<s> For everything.
<s> Thank you.
<s> He escaped.  He's going back in.
<s> Why would you be there?
<s> You have everything?
<s> Goodnight.
<s> I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
<s> It'll be fine.
<s> You know that great thing, though?  Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.  It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  Or it can just blow you away.  Make you something different in an instant.  It happened to me.
<s> See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
<s> He's got nothing to do with me.
<s> I'm telling you now.
<s> Getting high, I guess.
<s> I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
<s> To hide a black eye.
<s> Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
<s> Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
<s> Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!
<s> Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
<s> I can die trying.
<s> Thanks for telling me.
<s> I want you to find someone for me.
<s> Three.
<s> Oh.  Sorry.
<s> Ring the bell before you try the door.
<s> But you can't call me while you think?
<s> Where will you live?
<s> I want him with me.
<s> Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
<s> Which?
<s> What have you been before today?
<s> Do you remember?
<s> My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
<s> No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
<s> You got any weed?
<s> She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen.  I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing.  She like figures things out on her own and then that's it.
<s> We should take a vacation.
<s> You can't go with me because of Sam?
<s> Hey.
<s> It's not ours.  It's George's.
<s> I don't know what I'm doing.
<s> This is what he wants.
<s> Nagger?
<s> We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
<s> Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
<s> But you can't.
<s> Is Spanky here?
<s> She got married last month.
<s> I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
<s> Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
<s> It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
<s> You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
<s> As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.
<s> Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
<s> I can't wait to see that. You slay me, man.
<s> Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
<s> I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
<s> Why didn't you take it?
<s> Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
<s> Yeah, I want some pie.
<s> Still got that ten dollars?
<s> While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.
<s> My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --
<s> Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
<s> Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
<s> Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
<s> My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
<s> Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
<s> Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
<s> They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
<s> Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
<s> So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?
<s> Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
<s> Whatever.
<s> Make 'em throw strikes.
<s> My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
<s> I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
<s> I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
<s> He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
<s> That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
<s> They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
<s> Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
<s> You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
<s> You didn't get ketchup?
<s> So?
<s> Made just for you, Cookie.
<s> New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here.
<s> That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line...
<s> Hey, Ray...
<s> Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York.
<s> You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously.
<s> You should have come by last night, Radio. You woulda had yourself some fun.
<s> Me? Willie Long.
<s> But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
<s> If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
<s> No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
<s> And he's dead serious.
<s> I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
<s> My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
<s> Well tell her I said "hi" back.
<s> We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
<s> You're already there...
<s> That turn you on there, RuPaul?
<s> It's not me, moron.
<s> Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
<s> Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
<s> Look. You were really high. Things happen.
<s> I think you're looking at him.
<s> Please, pop, just go back to your room.
<s> This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
<s> Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
<s> The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
<s> Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
<s> I know, your wickedness.
<s> That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
<s> I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
<s> By she, do you mean he?
<s> We know where to find Nicky.
<s> You followed him?
<s> You keep a bat under your seat?
<s> All right...
<s> Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
<s> Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
<s> Why are you laughing?
<s> My dad's an optometrist.
<s> If you want to.
<s> Okay, I do. Get back up here.
<s> That was Cassius!
<s> Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
<s> A black guy?
<s> Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
<s> See something you like, my man?
<s> I don't know?
<s> No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
<s> Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
<s> You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
<s> Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
<s> Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
<s> Of course not! I'm curious, not sick. 
<s> What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than --  come on, Sandman.
<s> Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
<s> You? Why? You're already beautiful.
<s> I'm fine...  See you...
<s> It has nothing to do with you.
<s> I'm very smart.
<s> How a Sandman lives.
<s> I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
<s> All right.
<s> What do you need?
<s> We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
<s> I have.
<s> Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
<s> Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
<s> Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
<s> Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
<s> You know, Jessica.
<s> Of course.
<s> You want there to be one... that doesn't...
<s> You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
<s> All this. All of it.
<s> Oh, my...
<s> No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.
<s> Gracious... no.
<s> I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
<s> More... many more.
<s> Yes...
<s> You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think.
<s> And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
<s> Or not so recently?
<s> You know what I think?
<s> I don't know.
<s> I used to.
<s> No, honey... It was part of the deal.
<s> He works for Mr. Eddy.
<s> He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
<s> Yeah.
<s> We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
<s> Up the stairs - down the hall.
<s> You really don't remember the other night, do you?
<s> Sit down.
<s> Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
<s> I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
<s> I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
<s> Who was the man?
<s> I... I didn't say anything...
<s> FUCKIN' "A".
<s> Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
<s> But my head...
<s> What do you mean? You're where right now?
<s> Wake me up when you get home.
<s> What night?
<s> Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
<s> Thanks, guys.
<s> Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
<s> At your house. Don't you remember?
<s> Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
<s> Come on... get in.
<s> FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
<s> A paleontologist.
<s> You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
<s> It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
<s> I see.
<s> All right, all right. Keep quiet.
<s> That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
<s> All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
<s> As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
<s> I'll say.
<s> Gold. You were going to
<s> Leaving?
<s> I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
<s> So there are others?
<s> You're startled?
<s> Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
<s> Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
<s> I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
<s> Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!
<s> The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
<s> Oh, dear.
<s> Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
<s> But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
<s> I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
<s> Mine?
<s> Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
<s> You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
<s> What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
<s> There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
<s> I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
<s> Chang! Chang! Chang!
<s> Porters?
<s> I don't see that there's anything to say.
<s> You're wrong, George.
<s> What if he refuses?
<s> We'd be eternally grateful if you
<s> Yes. Hold this pigeon.
<s> Bump?
<s> Why?
<s> I was just going to.
<s> Why, mother?
<s> It's Fenner.
<s> I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
<s> It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
<s> No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
<s> Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
<s> Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
<s> Yup.  Sure is.
<s> Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
<s> I taught kindergarten.
<s> If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
<s> It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
<s> Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
<s> No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
<s> We're rising.
<s> I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
<s> Since as long as we've been keeping records...
<s> In case I need it.
<s> Kay!?
<s> Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
<s> There wasn't time, sport!
<s> Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
<s> Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.
<s> I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.
<s> Actually, you may have.
<s> I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
<s> Why not?
<s> What do we do?    Lean into it.
<s> Out of focus?
<s> Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
<s> You're not taking me in!
<s> Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
<s> It's... coming.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Nope.  Nothing at all.
<s> Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
<s> What the hell is going on?
<s> What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
<s> Just a guess.  But I think found a nest.
<s> Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
<s> And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
<s> Is it now?
<s> Agatha...
<s> She died?
<s> That's comforting.
<s> Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
<s> We know each other?
<s> Yes, you did.
<s> Show me just Agatha's data stream.
<s> Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
<s> I understand.  Sir.
<s> He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
<s> I go running down there.
<s> We won't let them.
<s> How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
<s> The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
<s> No maglev system.
<s> That was easy.
<s> Maybe you didn't hear me.
<s> There's no question.  You don't have any.
<s> There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
<s> Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
<s> I need your help.
<s> So?
<s> Once I even told him I loved him.
<s> The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
<s> Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
<s> Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
<s> I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
<s> What the fuck is going on?
<s> Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
<s> So you won't help me?
<s> I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
<s> No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
<s> I thought you were retiring?
<s> Lamar --
<s> Yes.  This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...
<s> Yes.
<s> Two?
<s> I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
<s> I forgot my glasses.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
<s> Is it a good room?
<s> Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
<s> Bullshit.
<s> Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
<s> Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
<s> The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
<s> Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
<s> Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
<s> I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
<s> She'll be out in a minute.
<s> To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
<s> This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
<s> We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
<s> Yeah?
<s> What do you mean 'troughed?'
<s> Ruiz tied in out there?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Ruiz knows about this?
<s> He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
<s> Nah, man...
<s> Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
<s> Ricky's taken care of.
<s> Yeah, he's getting there on his own.
<s> He's not here.
<s> Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
<s> I know the number.
<s> We'll kill Fairfax this year.
<s> Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
<s> Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
<s> To keep?
<s> But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
<s> Sold it, stole it, whatever...
<s> You would think.
<s> Fuck this.
<s> Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
<s> What do you have left?
<s> I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
<s> Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
<s> How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
<s> I don't want to take any more chances.
<s> Tom. How's it going?
<s> What do you mean 'kinda?'
<s> You want your surprise?
<s> You see a Ricky Slade?
<s> S'up.
<s> A little.
<s> Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
<s> I know what 'strapped' means, motherfucker. What the fuck you think this shit is? '21 Jump Street?'  Cool out, they're coming back. Just throw up your screw face and don't speak unless spoken to.
<s> Why? What I say bad?
<s> Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.
<s> Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
<s> Does anyone want another?
<s> No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
<s> You'll love it.
<s> Different.
<s> Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
<s> What?
<s> And where might that be?
<s> Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
<s> Red, and I ain't no punk.
<s> YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
<s> Let 'em come. I'm ready.
<s> Nnnnnnn!
<s> Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
<s> I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
<s> You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
<s> I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
<s> When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
<s> Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
<s> Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
<s> You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
<s> Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
<s> Okay, okay.
<s> But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
<s> Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
<s> You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
<s> Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
<s> Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
<s> No. That's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you?
<s> I sure met some.
<s> -- the hardest and the greatest.
<s> All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
<s> And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
<s> What?
<s> How old are you, Betty?
<s> Are you?
<s> What do you want me to do?
<s> What did I tell you about assuming?
<s> Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
<s> Please, go ahead.
<s> For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.
<s> Let me do it then.
<s> Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
<s> The sentences to run concurrently.
<s> These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
<s> Please make way, please --
<s> And don't come back.
<s> How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
<s> Might be all right.
<s> Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
<s> All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood.
<s> It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
<s> [Daniel what?]
<s> [Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]
<s> [Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
<s> [I want you.]
<s> [You stole the drop.]
<s> Yes.
<s> It's loaded.
<s> Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
<s> Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
<s> Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
<s> Pinta...
<s> Yes or no?
<s> I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.
<s> Different door. Not far from here.
<s> The United States.
<s> Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
<s> I go to school, don't I?
<s> Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
<s> It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
<s> You need to practice.
<s> [Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
<s> Still not a question.
<s> Never.
<s> It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
<s> Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
<s> It's Creasy.
<s> Her beauty fucks with your mind.
<s> When?
<s> We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
<s> He has to go.
<s> [He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
<s> [We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
<s> I already ate.
<s> You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
<s> Two tourists who never went home.
<s> I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
<s> And they took that away.
<s> Oh, yeah.
<s> What makes you say that?
<s> My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.
<s> I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
<s> There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
<s> I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
<s> Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
<s> I feel fine.
<s> Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
<s> What happen?
<s> You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
<s> Catherine, don't make an opera outta this. The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. You are an old goat, and she has an Italian temper. She is a good girl, but you drive her crazy. Catherine, you are no fool. You know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down.
<s> Your son Marty?
<s> Maybe that would be a good idea.
<s> All right.
<s> Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
<s> Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody to take her home, you know what I mean? I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.
<s> No, I'm not kidding.
<s> Where you going now?
<s> Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
<s> That's the one.
<s> Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.
<s> That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
<s> You gotta good heart.
<s> You gonna get married.
<s> Well, let's not get inna fight about it, Ma.
<s> Hey, Ang'...
<s> Hey, Marty, come over here a minute.
<s> Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
<s> This is a good deal here, Marty.
<s> Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?
<s> You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking. 
<s> Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
<s> Sure, sure.
<s> How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
<s> Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
<s> Waddaya talking about?!!
<s> Hospital.
<s> No.  Or why you should.
<s> Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
<s> I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
<s> I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
<s> Or her figger.
<s> Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
<s> What the hell's going on here?
<s> What's there to do? You found the sliver.
<s> You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
<s> What's he got to write, for God's sake?
<s> You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
<s> Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
<s> Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
<s> Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
<s> I want to talk to you, Pierce.
<s> Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
<s> If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
<s> And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
<s> No, no, that one.
<s> And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
<s> Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!
<s> They're coming.
<s> That's right. We work well together.
<s> We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
<s> No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
<s> Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
<s> You're leaving tomorrow?
<s> That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
<s> It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
<s> It happens to be a matter of life and death.
<s> Second pint.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Just in dreams?
<s> Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
<s> Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
<s> I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.
<s> I'm afraid so, Colonel.
<s> Morning, Captain.
<s> I used to throw the javelin.
<s> Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
<s> No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
<s> A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paperand forty heads are chopped off!
<s> Hello.
<s> Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
<s> All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.
<s> Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
<s> You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor
<s> Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
<s> What letter?
<s> Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
<s> Plus a bonus.
<s> Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
<s> No, no, no. Now that's too much!
<s> Yeah, a little.
<s> Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
<s> You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
<s> Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
<s> Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?
<s> Shut up! If you weren't drunk I'd
<s> That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
<s> And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
<s> No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
<s> Did you want to see her about something important?
<s> Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers.
<s> You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
<s> How?
<s> Yeah.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.
<s> He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
<s> You're my hero.
<s> It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
<s> I need to get something straight first.
<s> Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
<s> Yep.
<s> Like it had to be done.
<s> National Marksman Competition.
<s> I have two words for you... Seek help.
<s> We lost.
<s> Damnit!
<s> Pull up alongside.
<s> Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
<s> I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
<s> I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
<s> Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
<s> Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
<s> Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
<s> You heard.
<s> You got a bet on the game tonight?
<s> Mmm, needs a little something.
<s> It's okay. We broke up.

<s> Okay, I think I could swing that.
<s> Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
<s> What happened to your Trans Am?
<s> I'll provide you with transportation.
<s> Who's running it!
<s> We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
<s> Yes, I believe he has --
<s> Because I took it out of your memory.
<s> -- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
<s> About what?
<s> Guests?
<s> That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.
<s> Nothing, go back to sleep.
<s> True.  But why?
<s> In a computer program.
<s> It's not real.
<s> Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
<s> And all dreams, no matter how appealing, must eventually end.
<s> Unfinished business.
<s> At least a day.
<s> -- He says the maze has been changed. I need to know for sure.
<s> The weather.
<s> -- He won't.
<s> Go!
<s> The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
<s> -- You told me.
<s> This.  No point to it.
<s> Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.

<s> LET'S FLY!
<s> There's enough for everybody!
<s> BULK!!

<s> How about Major Moron?
<s> And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky!
<s> Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
<s> Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
<s> Scared.
<s> I cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
<s> Can't we get a couple whores over?
<s> What's that divided four ways?
<s> You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
<s> Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
<s> Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
<s> For being a bootlegger?
<s> I'm already late.
<s> And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.

<s> Come off it, Bugs.
<s> So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.

<s> Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
<s> My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
<s> That's not going to stop his nightmare -
<s> Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
<s> You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
<s> Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
<s> YOU SET ME UP!!
<s> Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
<s> But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
<s> Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
<s> They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
<s> Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
<s> <u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
<s> He called me "Doc."
<s> They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
<s> <i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
<s> Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
<s> THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
<s> Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
<s> What?
<s> I'm just concerned about my daughter.
<s> What pictures?
<s> I don't want to talk about it.
<s> No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
<s> What does he do?
<s> Are you sure you got my bag in?
<s> Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
<s> Thanks very much, sonny--
<s> Looks like it, but--
<s> It couldn't be.
<s> Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
<s> I would cherish you--and stay sober.
<s> Who?
<s> They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
<s> He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
<s> Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--
<s> I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
<s> Waiter!
<s> Yeah, I know. That's okay.
<s> You said it!
<s> Why me?
<s> You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?
<s> Well, then, that's great! And that's a great place to leave it! It's no use *my* barging into this now and--
<s> Yes, yes--phone, phone--  A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll look into this--  Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! Terrible!
<s> Great saints!
<s> For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!
<s> Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
<s> Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
<s> Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
<s> Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
<s> I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
<s> Is *what* getting me down?
<s> Oh, a *boy*!
<s> Than what?
<s> Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
<s> H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
<s> Here--where are you running off to?
<s> That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
<s> I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
<s> The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?
<s> Mr. President, have I permission to bring into this Chamber evidence of the response from my State?
<s> Jefferson--
<s> Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
<s> Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--
<s> What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
<s> There *what* was?
<s> Most natural thing in the world!
<s> You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
<s> Punch?
<s> Oh, but this one is so simple.
<s> Oh, just a day--
<s> Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
<s> Why?
<s> Yes, I see that.
<s> The Steering Committee.
<s> Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
<s> Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
<s> I want to make that come to life-- yes, and lighted up like that, too-- for every boy in the land. Boys forget what their country means--just reading "land of the free" in history books. And they get to be men--and forget even more. Liberty is too precious to get buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men ought to hold it up in front of them--every day of their lives and say: "I am free--to think--to speak. My ancestors couldn't. I can. My children will."
<s> He did?
<s> I also answer to whistles.
<s> No--
<s> Great.
<s> Must have been tickled pink.
<s> Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
<s> Not another bill?
<s> Don't mention it--
<s> That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
<s> And how's your bill, Senator?
<s> Well--I--
<s> The Senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered!
<s> I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--
<s> What do you mean? What's going on?
<s> Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
<s> I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.
<s> What's the matter?
<s> Let's get away from here. 
<s> Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
<s> Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
<s> Susan!
<s> Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
<s> Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
<s> Go away, Nosey.
<s> Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
<s> You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
<s> I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--
<s> Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
<s> Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
<s> All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
<s> Will Senator Smith yield to--?
<s> Morning, neighbors. Morning.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> He sure is.
<s> No, no children.
<s> Thank you very much.
<s> Would you like to go for a walk?
<s> Yes!
<s> What happened?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> He did? I play the tuba
<s> Sure!
<s> Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
<s> Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
<s> Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
<s> Let's just walk, okay?
<s> Why? Why do we have to do it?
<s> We're not going out tonight.
<s> I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
<s> With pay!  She is out the door.
<s> Last night he proposed to me.
<s> Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Me, sir?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Perfect! Perfect!
<s> I wanna see that guy!
<s> The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
<s> See you later, kid.
<s> Buffer?
<s> When?
<s> No, thank you.
<s> Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
<s> Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
<s> No, thanks.
<s> Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
<s> Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
<s> Only common sense.
<s> No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
<s> That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
<s> Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
<s> Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
<s> But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
<s> You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
<s> Ja.
<s> Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
<s> That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
<s> You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
<s> One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
<s> Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
<s> Yes?
<s> Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I
<s> Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.
<s> No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
<s> Thank you, Your Honor.
<s> Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
<s> Oh, the poet? Where?
<s> That's all right. I got it off my chest.
<s> Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
<s> Of course they're going to stay.  She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top?  Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.
<s> Don't pay any attention to her.
<s> South Dakota north.
<s> South Dakota - but on the top.
<s> Yeah. What?
<s> Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
<s> Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
<s> Excuse me. What did you say?
<s> Every man to his taste, sir.
<s> Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
<s> Oh, I do too, sir.
<s> You have no pants, sir.
<s> What two policemen?
<s> You try it.
<s> One hundred books?
<s> You must have been concerned.
<s> "There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
<s> And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
<s> Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
<s> Now we're back on track.
<s> There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
<s> We've been talking about her, mostly.
<s> A little.
<s> No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
<s> It's a pretty piece of land.
<s> ...And?
<s> Why do you watch?
<s> Lily.
<s> -- Go on!
<s> Thanks for your help, Lionel.
<s> Don't need it.
<s> Is she a friend of yours?
<s> We're going for a walk.
<s> Mother... go away!
<s> What do you mean?
<s> About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
<s> You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
<s> No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
<s> Maybe you'll catch it.
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
<s> Disgusting.
<s> You like it?
<s> That's what I like.
<s> I think so.
<s> I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
<s> Will you be here?
<s> It's a big part of the show.
<s> Where was this?
<s> What do you want me to see?
<s> What happened today?
<s> Is that the question?
<s> I understand.
<s> No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
<s> It's not?
<s> Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
<s> Everybody has a story, Skip.
<s> It wasn't the best situation.
<s> Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
<s> Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
<s> You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
<s> You're completely reliable.
<s> You want my advice? Far out!
<s> Wow.
<s> What?
<s> When?
<s> I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
<s> Priests. Imhotep's priests.
<s> They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
<s> Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
<s> Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
<s> Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
<s> Why do you like to fight so much?
<s> This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
<s> Perhaps.
<s> To have stopped this creature? Yes!
<s> You will not believe it.
<s> Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
<s> Want to know?
<s> Oh that's comforting.
<s> What are those mirrors for?
<s> Preparation for what?
<s> Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
<s> Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
<s> And what is that?
<s> That bad huh?
<s> The creature!? Are you sure!?
<s> Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
<s> That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
<s> He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
<s> Of course.
<s> I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
<s> Fantasizing... about you.
<s> I'm his daughter.
<s> So who killed him?
<s> And some sandwiches --
<s> Do it, big boy!
<s> I'm the Bowler.
<s> But you're a superhero.
<s> It's me... Elizabeth.
<s> He's dead.
<s> Ummm.
<s> You're nuts.
<s> They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
<s> Really?
<s> Sure -- I guess.
<s> Are you nuts? Get out of there!
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
<s> But look at him... and look at us.
<s> I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
<s> Come on.
<s> And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
<s> But... the silverware?
<s> Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
<s> We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
<s> And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
<s> Who are they?
<s> Sorry.
<s> Are you sure he's still alive?
<s> Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
<s> It's suicide.
<s> Great timing!
<s> I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
<s> I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
<s> Proceed.
<s> Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
<s> No, thank you.
<s> Fair enough.
<s> It is a terrible shock.
<s> I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
<s> Yes, I am.
<s> I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
<s> You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
<s> His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
<s> What is that?
<s> I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
<s> Yes -- an excellent idea.
<s> I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
<s> My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
<s> Would you like some brandy?
<s> Good evening, Mademoiselle.
<s> One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
<s> Are you staying with a friend, sir?
<s> Is it a nice warm room, sir?
<s> Are you trying to insult me?
<s> You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
<s> Will you be joining us, soon?
<s> It's me.
<s> Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
<s> I couldn't face telling you.
<s> About Hippolyte Charles.
<s> God help me -- yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
<s> Of course, my dear.
<s> I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
<s> We have a treaty with Austria.
<s> I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
<s> No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.
<s> Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
<s> Thanks, Unc.
<s> You paid cash?
<s> Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.
<s> If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!
<s> I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
<s> Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
<s> Thanks for reminding me.
<s> I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
<s> Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
<s> Fuuuuuuck -- U!
<s> I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
<s> Ain't no windows in here.
<s> Still gonna smell it.
<s> I don't know yet.
<s> I didn't see nothing.
<s> No.
<s> That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
<s> Oh yeah, why you walking?
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
<s> Okay.
<s> Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
<s> No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
<s> I'll remember.
<s> Have you seen Day-Day?
<s> Come on.
<s> Strange activity.  I think they running drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe me.
<s> You damn right that's the big one.
<s> And some rolling papers.
<s> Ya'll live around here?
<s> Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday.
<s> Bite his ear!
<s> He's a boy, dude.
<s> What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
<s> Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
<s> He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
<s> That ain't gonna work.
<s> What?
<s> Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
<s> Take your car.
<s> I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
<s> Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.
<s> That's my girl.
<s> What?
<s> Business.
<s> What?
<s> My security people are right next door.
<s> I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
<s> Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
<s> What's your point?
<s> At one thirty my little girl is dead.
<s> That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
<s> That's right. That gives you...
<s> I think you're right.
<s> I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
<s> I'm just an accountant.
<s> I remember. The big tipper.
<s> In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
<s> It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
<s> Yeah, all right, listen...
<s> I don't know.
<s> I see. Where is this gun?
<s> Shut up.
<s> What gives?
<s> No.
<s> Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
<s> Yes, Dad.
<s> Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
<s> Yes! Yes!
<s> Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
<s> Say what, Walt Spoon!
<s> Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
<s> Bluebeard!
<s> The money, Icey.
<s> It's a shame!
<s> I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
<s> Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
<s> Who's them Blue Men yonder?
<s> Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
<s> Sshhh...
<s> She's gone to Moundsville.
<s> Why?
<s> Somewheres. I don't know yet.
<s> That's Daddy!
<s> She talks to herself.
<s> About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
<s> I'll make coffee.
<s> A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
<s> You could save him, little bird.
<s> Yes?
<s> What secret shall I tell?
<s> All right.
<s> Naturally.
<s> Yes; from the first night.
<s> What you been up to?
<s> It's just made her think... her dreams are real...
<s> She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
<s> Hi.
<s> Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
<s> My dream.
<s> You got a sane explanation for what he did?
<s> No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
<s> S'curity.
<s> Go on...
<s> Have you any money?
<s> Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
<s> It's from Paris.
<s> From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?
<s> Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
<s> I see.
<s> Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
<s> I don't want to go to Siberia.
<s> Possibly.
<s> I can tell you exactly.
<s> That's right... and we might as well face it.
<s> And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
<s> How many families live here with you?
<s> Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
<s> Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.
<s> Yes, Comrade?
<s> Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.
<s> I must be stern with you.
<s> Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
<s> Oh, yes, yes.
<s> Good morning, Gaston.
<s> Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
<s> No, sir.
<s> While you eat, you look at the view.
<s> Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
<s> ...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
<s> But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
<s> Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
<s> You mean you are deserting Russia?
<s> We can't... but you are so ingenious, Leon...
<s> It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
<s> We did our best, Comrade.
<s> We did it with the best intentions...
<s> Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
<s> Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
<s> Yes. It is unfortunate.
<s> Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
<s> I think so too.
<s> I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
<s> I'll try.
<s> And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
<s> You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!
<s> No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
<s> Thank you. Thank you.
<s> Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
<s> Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...
<s> The telephone is ringing.
<s> But one of your friends may be in need of you. You must answer.
<s> All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
<s> Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
<s> Why?
<s> No.
<s> A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
<s> My darling.
<s> Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
<s> No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
<s> No! No!
<s> Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
<s> ...but big.
<s> Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
<s> Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
<s> Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
<s> Is this your new dress suit?
<s> How do you do?
<s> Yes.
<s> Has done what?
<s> Hello.
<s> What?
<s> I told you to go, madame.
<s> Go on.
<s> That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
<s> What do you want?
<s> Yes.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Where do you eat?
<s> Where is that?
<s> What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
<s> Where the hell is he?
<s> Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
<s> Son of a bitch.
<s> You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John.  It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...
<s> In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.
<s> Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time.
<s> You do it.
<s> 'Cause he hates you.  It's worse when you get it from someone you trust.
<s> Well, he's photogenic.  Let's try dog bones?
<s> Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
<s> No, sir.
<s> Well, no place where they speak English.  That way he can always say he was misquoted.
<s> Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
<s> It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...
<s> At least Mitchell stood up to it.
<s> How do you see this?
<s> There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.
<s> That fruitcake!  What about him?
<s> Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
<s> No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
<s> You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
<s> He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
<s> Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
<s> Sir?
<s> This could be it ... this could be it. Four long years ...
<s> For God's sake, when does this end?!
<s> Sir ... six bodies.
<s> Why me?
<s> Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
<s> Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.
<s> The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
<s> Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
<s> My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
<s> Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
<s> Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
<s> Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
<s> It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
<s> It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
<s> Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President: "The power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up."  The Communists have never been closer.  Now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president.  Let the Communists know you're onto them.
<s> Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
<s> He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
<s> I always get my man.
<s> Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
<s> A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
<s> Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
<s> ... and what do we get for it?  Gobs and gobs of bullshit, gossip, nothing! Someone is leaking. We've got to stop the leaks, Henry, at any cost, do you hear me?  Then we can go for the big play -- China, Russia.
<s> I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
<s> How a fat man gets so many girls.
<s> Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
<s> Sure, I'd like to offer condolences.
<s> But change always comes slowly.  I've withdrawn more than half the troops. I'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years.  I want an all-volunteer army.  But it's also a question of American credibility, our position in the world ...
<s> I like jazz ...
<s> Elvis I like, too.
<s> She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
<s> What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
<s> Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
<s> That's right.
<s> Compassionate.  Grateful.
<s> ... and get rid of all these "goddamns" and "Jesus Christs"!
<s> I want a divorce.
<s> You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
<s> Are you serious?
<s> De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
<s> You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
<s> Will you ... would you kiss me?
<s> I've missed you.
<s> You personally?
<s> Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
<s> Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Dick? Call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ...
<s> No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
<s> I deduced it. Once you walked in.
<s> I don't know. I feel overmatched.
<s> I'm... discouraged.
<s> That's very linear Sheriff.
<s> I don't know...
<s> So when was he here?
<s> I don't know. He ought to...
<s> Okay.
<s> I always am.
<s> Well. If you say so.
<s> Lord no. I'm not retired.
<s> Well they always is to the party concerned.
<s> I didn't see my Prednizone.
<s> Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
<s> You should be used to that.
<s> Yes ma'am?
<s> I know where it's going to be.
<s> You know who it is.
<s> Why would I care where you're going.
<s> Sixty-nine cent.
<s> I was just passin' the time.
<s> ...Where you want me to put it?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Somethin' like that.
<s> Let's just call it square.
<s> That's got two double beds.
<s> What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
<s> I know what it is. He won't find me again.
<s> Yes.
<s> What did I say?
<s> To kill your wife.
<s> No I don't have it.
<s> I don't know.
<s> BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
<s> GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
<s> You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
<s> It's fine. Mind your own meal...
<s> Anyway, so what?
<s> So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
<s> You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
<s> I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
<s> Little place called "Williams," why?
<s> No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
<s> This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
<s> I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
<s> I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
<s> "Thirty-two?"
<s> Oh, Betty --
<s> I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
<s> I gotta go make dinner.
<s> Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
<s> The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --
<s> No, Del.
<s> What happened when you were twelve?
<s> I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
<s> It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
<s> What do you mean? What did I do to you...
<s> ...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
<s> I ran back in to get the phone.
<s> Make sure it's elevated...
<s> What's his real name?
<s> Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
<s> Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
<s> Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
<s> I have no idea what you're talking about.
<s> I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
<s> Fine.
<s> ...okay.
<s> I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
<s> I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
<s> No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...
<s> Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
<s> Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
<s> You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
<s> Ahh... my wife's.
<s> It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
<s> Of what?
<s> Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?  Is that stupid, Wesley?
<s> Beer, please.
<s> Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
<s> ...that's a good motto.
<s> I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
<s> Should I kill him now?
<s> ...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
<s> You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
<s> A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
<s> I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
<s> You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
<s> Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
<s> Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
<s> Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
<s> I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
<s> "It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
<s> Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
<s> I said I'll think about it.
<s> Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
<s> No! Let me try this!
<s> What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
<s> Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
<s> Better.
<s> Sure.
<s> What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
<s> Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
<s> I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
<s> I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
<s> The law. Well the law is a human institution.
<s> That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
<s> What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?
<s> Do not seek the treasure!
<s> Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
<s> That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
<s> I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
<s> I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
<s> Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option!
<s> Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
<s> Problem a p'seption.
<s> Helluva awgazation.
<s> Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
<s> Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
<s> Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
<s> Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
<s> Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
<s> Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.
<s> He's a suitor!
<s> Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
<s> You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
<s> Naw. That's over with.
<s> Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am...
<s> Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
<s> Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
<s> Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you.  Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here!  No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!
<s> Yes, Joe.
<s> I don't mean anything by it.
<s> No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
<s> I'm doing okay, sir.
<s> Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
<s> Yes, sir!
<s> How're you doing, Sarge?
<s> I didn't call you anything before that.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Yes, sir!!
<s> Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
<s> Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
<s> What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
<s> What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
<s> We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
<s> I got my foot on the floor.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
<s> Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
<s> You're better than candy.
<s> I've never had a girl.
<s> I'll get it if you want.
<s> I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
<s> No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
<s> No. Is that what you want?
<s> Your real father?
<s> I bet you do!
<s> He said he grew up poor?
<s> Sure.
<s> A little.
<s> You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
<s> But it can't wait.
<s> Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
<s> God.
<s> Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
<s> I can't just...
<s> The kid in here.  The other two when we come out.
<s> Keep your voice down.
<s> Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?
<s> Yeah.  Kidnapping.
<s> Pure idiot.
<s> Shut up and let me think.
<s> Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
<s> KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
<s> Not at all.
<s> A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A castle keep, in medieval times.
<s> No fucking way.
<s> Why?
<s> People.  In the house.
<s> Chills?
<s> Little bit.  Yeah.
<s> Shhh...
<s> Yeah, but where's the third guy?
<s> Stop it.
<s> I'm dizzy and thirsty.
<s> What if I do?
<s> No man. PE -- "political education."
<s> Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
<s> Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made...
<s> Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.
<s> Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
<s> I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
<s> A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
<s> Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important.
<s> They were empty...
<s> You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
<s> Maybe...
<s> He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
<s> Nothing.
<s> What are you saying?
<s> Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk.
<s> Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
<s> I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
<s> What?
<s> You don't look alright.
<s> I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
<s> It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> Late summer.
<s> I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
<s> No, he takes after his mother...
<s> Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
<s> As do you.
<s> You couldn't have known.
<s> Lovely.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> With a lace table cloth?
<s> My pleasure, sir.
<s> That one is a bit more difficult.
<s> As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  And my men are excellent marksmen.
<s> If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
<s> Perhaps.
<s> Not yet.  What happened?
<s> Where?
<s> He left us.
<s> Thirteen years...
<s> Name five hundred.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
<s> Long time.
<s> How many men have we seen die?
<s> No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another.  Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
<s> I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.
<s> He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
<s> When?
<s> But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
<s> Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?
<s> Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
<s> Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
<s> Yayyy!
<s> Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
<s> Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
<s> Yes.
<s> I know.
<s> I'm sure you're not.
<s> Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
<s> Don't worry about that.
<s> No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
<s> Well...a touch of the flu...
<s> It's Ellie's cat.
<s> Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
<s> Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
<s> AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
<s> They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --
<s> She.  Goes.  Free.
<s> Say the name, or I slit your throat.
<s> I'll torture it out of you.
<s> Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
<s> All right then.
<s> Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
<s> By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
<s> Did you, now?
<s> Then I can wear men's clothing.
<s> I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
<s> Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
<s> Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
<s> A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
<s> Not when you can drink instead, at least.
<s> Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
<s> More to drink!
<s> Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
<s> Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
<s> Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
<s> Pirate.
<s> Somewhat.
<s> Why ask me?
<s> My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
<s> Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
<s> So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
<s> Aye!  Avast!
<s> He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
<s> The worst.  On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.
<s> Yes it is.  I've seen it.
<s> Bleak.  Very bleak.
<s> A moment.
<s> No.
<s> Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
<s> A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.
<s> You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
<s> You mean besides kicking your ass?!
<s> She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
<s> In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
<s> Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here.
<s> You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
<s> What did he want?
<s> That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
<s> No!  Well, not those exact words.
<s> Same old Daniel.
<s> It was a long time ago, Daniel.  We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all.
<s> You think the chemists that invented Agent Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'Boy, I really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.'  You think Oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?
<s> You're insane.
<s> Susan, this is the future of America here.
<s> Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
<s> Daniel!
<s> If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
<s> Got it.
<s> Three days ago it was.
<s> And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!
<s> Yeah.  Old times.
<s> No problem.
<s> The nanobot... it's not here...
<s> What did you want my hair for?
<s> I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
<s> Like a glove.
<s> The head shrinker at the prison.
<s> Did you think I could just leave you...?
<s> I'm real touched.  Now get your Sunday's on.  We're going for a ride.
<s> Yeah, and what might that be?
<s> Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
<s> While you remain on the staff at Argon Laboratories, your priorities will always be the same as Dr. Argon's priorities.  I imagine that is a simple enough equation for a bright girl like you to figure out.
<s> Get him, Daniel!  Knock his block off!
<s> Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
<s> Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
<s> I'm glad.
<s> I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
<s> I see.
<s> Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
<s> I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
<s> Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
<s> Hey, make up your mind, will you?
<s> Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.
<s> Yeah - go on.
<s> Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
<s> It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.
<s> The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
<s> Do you call yourself a reporter?
<s> You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
<s> No? Well, where were you when that happened?
<s> Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
<s> I'm not quitting!
<s> Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir.
<s> I beg your pardon, sir?
<s> A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
<s> Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
<s> Yes.
<s> There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
<s> Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
<s> Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
<s> Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
<s> Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
<s> Right!
<s> Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
<s> Yeah?
<s> It'll be ready in a minute.
<s> Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
<s> Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
<s> And now for that twentieth crack
<s> Hello, Joe.
<s> "Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"
<s> Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> I understand, sir.
<s> Now the lady said you may go
<s> Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
<s> Yeah?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Yeah ...  That--and ...
<s> No ... They won't be able to tell.
<s> Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
<s> ... It's a pretty short trip.
<s> I'm sorry ...
<s> Thanks.
<s> She's crying.
<s> But I really should get home.
<s> All night?
<s> I told you, George. I'm not going.
<s> Really Biff? The keenest?
<s> ... Lover's Lane.
<s> It's better, Mary Sue.
<s> No it couldn't!
<s> Oh, no thanks ...
<s> "Changes."
<s> Thank you very much.
<s> No. Of course not.
<s> Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
<s> The other one?
<s> No way.
<s> Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this.
<s> I don't know.
<s> As a matter of fact he does.
<s> Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
<s> One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
<s> What?
<s> What were you doing in a library?
<s> Jen please ...
<s> So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
<s> Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
<s> Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
<s> I told you. I'm like positive.
<s> Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
<s> Hunh?
<s> Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
<s> Nice ... Nice ...
<s> Because we don't belong!
<s> But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
<s> Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
<s> Re-runs?
<s> Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
<s> Why don't you just take me back without it?
<s> ... Yeah.
<s> Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
<s> Yeah ...
<s> Just listen to me ...
<s> Why?
<s> ... What's that?
<s> I'll never be able to do that.
<s> I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
<s> No.
<s> ......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
<s> I'm in my bedroom.
<s> What do you mean it doesn't matter?
<s> You have a girlfriend?
<s> Where is she?
<s> I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
<s> I do pretty good, I think. I wish I was making more, doing a little bit better. I can,t get over a certain hump. I will...I will crack something soon I think and really do better...I'd like to diversify...but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.
<s> Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
<s> Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
<s> ....what....?
<s> We got disconnected before....
<s> I don't know.
<s> It's fine. It was fun, though.
<s> Yeah, not really.
<s> Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
<s> That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
<s> Are you guys hurt?
<s> Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
<s> Yes? I'm trying.
<s> So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
<s> yeah.
<s> I think maybe over a hundred.
<s> You can't do that.
<s> Did you do it?
<s> You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
<s> That's fine.
<s> CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
<s> NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
<s> You came all the way from Los Angeles to tell me that?
<s> We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
<s> Business is very food, thanks. ELIZABETH What's very food?
<s> You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
<s> It takes time to process --
<s> Yes I'm fine.
<s> Hi, Lance.
<s> You should go on a trip.
<s> ....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....
<s> Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
<s> You know, please, I just wanna say that I didn't say I would help her out; I was very clear about it....I don't think that this is fair.....wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch.....
<s> This is a bunch of bullshit.
<s> I'm serious.
<s> Don't puss out.
<s> I want you to go right away, I think that's best. I also need you to check out a car for me down there that this guy is selling.
<s> I'm only paying two of you guys.
<s> Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
<s> Ok.
<s> He did seem a little strange.
<s> My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
<s> For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
<s> "One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."
<s> Yes, Abbe?
<s> Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
<s> It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
<s> But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
<s> Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
<s> I'll fill page after page, I promise.
<s> Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?
<s> A man after my own heart...
<s> Coulmier, you animal!
<s> Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
<s> An innocent child is dead.
<s> Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
<s> Was it impotence?
<s> It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
<s> A few indiscretions in his youth.
<s> Do you favor its publication?
<s> Shut down?
<s> But he's one among some two hundred wards --
<s> Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
<s> Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
<s> How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
<s> Go on, child.
<s> Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
<s> Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
<s> No. But tell him I would.
<s> What thought is that?
<s> And I in yours.
<s> Of course.
<s> Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
<s> The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
<s> Uh-hub.
<s> Why is that, Louis?
<s> She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
<s> How much?
<s> You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
<s> It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
<s> You will not walk out on me
<s> I will not have this in my home.
<s> Sir? 
<s> Sir?
<s> We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some of us humans need sleep!
<s> Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
<s> Uh-huh
<s> Telling stories.
<s> You're a laugh-riot, kid.
<s> Like a bug.
<s> No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
<s> Okay, boy wonder, what?
<s> How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?!
<s> Don't do this
<s> Uh huh.
<s> I don't give a shit about-
<s> Christ.
<s> Herman.
<s> That's for me to decide.
<s> Get out.
<s> Again.
<s> Again
<s> Jesus
<s> They've all seen a rough cut
<s> "Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
<s> It's just that my movie is so-
<s> So, on to the Life Of Christ!
<s> Yes!
<s> Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West--
<s> For what?
<s> What?
<s> Where's your wife, Jake?
<s> Yeah. Do me a favor.
<s> Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
<s> You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
<s> What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
<s> Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> C'mon, Joey.
<s> What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
<s> Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
<s> Where you been?
<s> I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
<s> It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
<s> Stop it. What're you, crazy?
<s> What time is it?
<s> It's OK.
<s> Oh, Jake.
<s> What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
<s> I went to the movies.
<s> Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
<s> You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  You're rotten.  Rotten.  Rotten.  You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.
<s> Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
<s> What friends?
<s> He should.
<s> Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
<s> Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
<s> Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
<s> You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
<s> But his leg!
<s> Namely?
<s> Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
<s> Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.
<s> Well, officer -- do your duty.
<s> I'll bet it's been done.
<s> I was jaywalking.
<s> What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
<s> Mrs. Thorwald.
<s> I told you that --
<s> Like what?
<s> I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
<s> Did you get my note?
<s> I don't know what you mean.
<s> Lisa Fremont.
<s> No.
<s> It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
<s> Police?
<s> Got a shovel?
<s> There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
<s> That'll get her out of there, won't it?
<s> Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
<s> You haven't even heard from him?
<s> Empty as a football.
<s> We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
<s> That's good news.
<s> You mean leave the magazine?
<s> Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
<s> You'd better before you catch the disease!
<s> You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
<s> And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
<s> What's the apartment house number?
<s> To get on home.
<s> Not yet!
<s> That's what the witnesses told him.
<s> It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
<s> Well, -- if there was one less thread this way --  -- and two less that way --  -- I might give up bachelorhood.
<s> Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
<s> Shall we vote him in, Stella?
<s> Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
<s> I'm glad they let you out.
<s> What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
<s> Stay there.
<s> Jim Stark.
<s> Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
<s> And you dropped it?
<s> I'm not hungry.
<s> No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
<s> A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
<s> What's that pounding?
<s> Look--can't you see I'm writing?
<s> My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
<s> I'll wait for him.
<s> What?
<s> I just don't want trouble.
<s> Who knows.  Plato?
<s> How'd you find me?  What's happening?
<s> It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
<s> Not lately.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> I promise nothing'll happen if you do.  You want my jacket?  It's warm.
<s> They like you.  Okay?
<s> Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
<s> Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore!
<s> I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
<s> Mom--I'm not--
<s> Good Lord!
<s> No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
<s> You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
<s> Leave me alone.
<s> I don't know why--!
<s> And your folks didn't understand?
<s> Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> Listen--
<s> No.
<s> Why?
<s> There's just one thing.  What about--
<s> See, we're very modern.
<s> We have to go back!
<s> Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
<s> It's all right.
<s> Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
<s> You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
<s> I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
<s> YES!!!
<s> -- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
<s> Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
<s> No, hey, I like your coat --
<s> I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
<s> Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
<s> Nick --
<s> I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
<s> Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
<s> Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now.
<s> Nick, the ice is --
<s> Don't say my name...
<s> We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
<s> Who wouldn't.
<s> I shared his cell!
<s> What?
<s> J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
<s> Samantha.
<s> No. It's her brother.
<s> Nick don't talk till Nick gets something.
<s> Why not.
<s> We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
<s> No, Gabriel... no...
<s> Leave the tree.
<s> And where they hide the real money.
<s> I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
<s> I'm just talking.
<s> Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
<s> I don't know, I've seen the business world.
<s> I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
<s> Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
<s> No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! "  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.
<s> Was he all pissed off?
<s> Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
<s> And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
<s> I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's a scene. Memorize it.
<s> It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
<s> Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
<s> The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.
<s> He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
<s> It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
<s> Why am I Mr. Pink?
<s> Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.
<s> I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
<s> Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
<s> Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
<s> Don't ask me that.
<s> Mr. Pink.
<s> Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
<s> Why not?
<s> The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
<s> Uh-uh, just cops.
<s> You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
<s> How can you be so sure?
<s> I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
<s> One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
<s> We don't think this place is safe.
<s> Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade?
<s> I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
<s> As far as -- Sonora?
<s> Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
<s> You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
<s> I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
<s> Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
<s> Go on. Tell me more about her.
<s> I'll make the soap myself.
<s> Will she be dark or fair?
<s> Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
<s> Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
<s> Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
<s> So did I. They were in it.
<s> The thing to do is stick to rabbits.
<s> You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
<s> Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
<s> How'd you happen to miss?
<s> Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.
<s> Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
<s> But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?
<s> That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
<s> I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
<s> What makes you think you're so almighty? Telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself.
<s> You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
<s> Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China...
<s> All right, you didn't know.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> He certainly could. About a month.
<s> Stop it --
<s> Yeah, we sure have.
<s> Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
<s> I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
<s> Since I can remember, Ma'am.
<s> Don't you even know your letters?
<s> I sure would.
<s> Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
<s> Thanks, Steve.
<s> Wife?!
<s> Alex, what are you doing?
<s> Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
<s> What?! What is it, a monster?!
<s> Okay.
<s> It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
<s> Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
<s> Then what kinda stuff can we do?
<s> Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
<s> Great!!!
<s> Well... okay... but only as a friend.
<s> No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
<s> No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
<s> Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
<s> Yes!!!!
<s> I don't need your help.
<s> Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together.
<s> Uh, uh.
<s> What are you getting at, Professor?
<s> What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
<s> What is it, Dwight?
<s> What?
<s> Oh, I couldn't do that.
<s> Yours, or the turkeys?
<s> What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
<s> Alright, go to the belt store...
<s> Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.
<s> Washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask Jesse Jackson.
<s> I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...
<s> Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
<s> Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
<s> You don't think...
<s> Is MOM... in there?
<s> MURDERED?!!
<s> I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
<s> I don't feel like rewinding it!
<s> Looks good, Mom!
<s> I'm so happy I could shit.
<s> You scared me.
<s> But, Chip...
<s> Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
<s> MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!
<s> Oohhhh, Eugene!
<s> Yes, I did.
<s> GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!
<s> Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
<s> Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
<s> Marvin A. Pickles.
<s> Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
<s> We all have bad nights. 
<s> Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
<s> Watch the booth! I'll be back! 
<s> But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
<s> Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
<s> I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
<s> Bon Appetit!
<s> I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
<s> What's he know?
<s> Sure I do.
<s> I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
<s> Which room is it?
<s> Thank you.
<s> You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
<s> I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
<s> But I like teaching school.
<s> Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
<s> I guess most people are.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Good.
<s> Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -
<s> Yes.
<s> I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
<s> We could tell him.
<s> I'm afraid.
<s> Yes.
<s> I have something even better.
<s> I can imagine.
<s> It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
<s> Bella Romari	If I were not seated, I would embrace you in three movements like a sonata.  Ah, my wonderful one. Fly with me tonight. We will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies.
<s> What a peculiar question.
<s> She was my patient.
<s> I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
<s> I don't know.
<s> It seems right to us.
<s> I always thought it was a more intimate relationship.
<s> It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
<s> I never thought you did.
<s> And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.
<s> That's too bad.
<s> Why?
<s> Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
<s> I know this is difficult for you. I know that you love her.
<s> Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
<s> Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
<s> Thank you.
<s> What's the first?
<s> You had sex with you therapist?
<s> Well, I wasn't always impotent.
<s> I know.
<s> I know.
<s> What do you have to do to get ready?
<s> Do you want me to stop?
<s> Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
<s> Yes.
<s> How come?
<s> I'm babbling.
<s> God, I m so mad at him!!
<s> Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!!
<s> That's very flattering.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine.
<s> I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
<s> Yes.
<s> He does.
<s> Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me.
<s> Yes.
<s> Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
<s> He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
<s> I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
<s> Will you stop? Jesus.
<s> Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
<s> What kinds of questions?
<s> Did he touch you?
<s> You touched him?
<s> That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
<s> Thirty-two dollars.
<s> Okay.
<s> She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
<s> Nope.
<s> What do you get?
<s> Just a moment.
<s> I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
<s> No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Different.
<s> So make an exception.
<s> Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
<s> I did.
<s> No, I mean doing it at my house.
<s> What's so stupid about it?
<s> I just... Ann is very...
<s> Or go someplace in a hurry.
<s> You know which tapes! Where are they?
<s> Goddamit...
<s> Brian Kirkland, please.
<s> Anyway, I've always said, the work is the thing. I can be happy without a marriage, but take away my work, that's different. And if Ann can't handle that, that's her problem, like we re all alone in this world, you know what I'm saying? I mean, fuck.  Jesus, what's takin' this guy?
<s> Sure.
<s> Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
<s> Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
<s> Nick, you're so strange...
<s> Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm.
<s> We live in 703.
<s> Gonna cut me open?
<s> That you, Rog?
<s> Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
<s> A wreck.
<s> What?
<s> As Janet's parents this should be really easy.  Your last clue... Mental Instability.  You have thirty seconds.
<s> I've caught it once or twice.
<s> On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
<s> Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
<s> No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
<s> ...closed?
<s> SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
<s> YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
<s> Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
<s> He's a lame dog, remember?  But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
<s> Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
<s> Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
<s> OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!
<s> No...couldn't I do this later?
<s> I understand your concern, but I feel it's time you started thinking of yourself.  Look at yourself.
<s> ...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
<s> No.
<s> I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
<s> I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
<s> Yeah, I'm here.
<s> Bottle.
<s> Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?
<s> Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
<s> A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
<s> No, we're paying for the wine.
<s> Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
<s> 100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
<s> Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
<s> Um... seventy... something.
<s> And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
<s> She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
<s> And Lexapro, yes.
<s> Let me call Christine.
<s> I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
<s> So you're going to stop acting?
<s> And she likes Pinot.
<s> How do you know?
<s> Miles.
<s> Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
<s> About a month ago. Six weeks.
<s> You have the keys.
<s> What?
<s> Nah. I want to watch this.
<s> You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
<s> I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
<s> Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
<s> Put me down, Jack.
<s> Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
<s> I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
<s> Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
<s> Hold on.
<s> I know. I love that.
<s> Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
<s> Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
<s> My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
<s> What about me?
<s> Great. What's the latest we can get there?
<s> It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
<s> So how're you doing?
<s> Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
<s> I guess.
<s> About a year.
<s> Both.
<s> This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
<s> Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
<s> Exactement!
<s> He had to make a phone call.
<s> Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed. Make sure the knot's tight.
<s> You don't even know what that word means.
<s> Me too.
<s> It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
<s> This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
<s> Curse and stuff.
<s> You don't mean it. It's just for show.
<s> Yes it was.
<s> He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.
<s> Yes.
<s> The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
<s> I'm close.
<s> It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.
<s> Have they said anything about our area?
<s> Me too.
<s> Don't.
<s> Where are we going to sleep?
<s> We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
<s> Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
<s> There are none.
<s> Six months.
<s> Pinned? What does that mean?
<s> Posse? What the hell you talking about?
<s> Where were you?
<s> Have you thought at all about your plans?
<s> They've been kind to me.
<s> I just came out to say goodbye.
<s> I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
<s> I'll be long gone.
<s> Looks like that's not all they admired.
<s> Where's Turley?
<s> And bridle-wise, too. She's the only thing I lost I really cared about.  'Cept for maybe my hat. It's a great one. Got a pretty silver band on it. My head spent three years training it.  I surely do miss that hat.
<s> Going to Turley, was it?
<s> Oh, I was just checking the, ah...  ...you know, lookin' in.
<s> Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.
<s> I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
<s> The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
<s> The other guy drew first.
<s> All I did was kiss the girl.
<s> Howdy.
<s> We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
<s> So this is the guy you're going to hang?
<s> Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
<s> It's none of your business.
<s> Good luck, Mal.
<s> Lucky.
<s> This is a lot of money.
<s> You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
<s> Why'd you go into business with him?
<s> He left me.
<s> If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
<s> I wouldn't worry about that.
<s> He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be.
<s> It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
<s> Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
<s> Please.
<s> We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
<s> Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
<s> Out of the question.  A circus like that?
<s> There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument".
<s> That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
<s> -- I can explain.
<s> Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
<s> No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
<s> Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
<s> -- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
<s> That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
<s> So you did meet her?
<s> Of course.
<s> ... so much like her?
<s> Please put your clothes on
<s> Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
<s> Hello, Hal.
<s> For you.  I want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale.  But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself.  She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins.  She's on the line now.
<s> Why not?
<s> I was misquoted.
<s> That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
<s> I've seen them all before.
<s> Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
<s> That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
<s> You do?
<s> You saw that?
<s> I'm already dead.
<s> Night, Lainey.
<s> I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
<s> She did... didn't she?
<s> Lainey...
<s> Max Sayer -- National Echo.
<s> It's a yacht.
<s> Why?
<s> You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
<s> I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
<s> Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
<s> --Do I know you?
<s> They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
<s> You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
<s> Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
<s> Yes.
<s> No, we're not.
<s> I guess she did.
<s> Maybe.
<s> What?
<s> Oh my God.
<s> Dead people.
<s> Ghosts.
<s> ...I don't know.
<s> Like what?
<s> You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
<s> S-ssstop that!
<s> I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.
<s> Oh yeah? Why's that?
<s> Someone actually... employs you?
<s> The band.
<s> Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
<s> Book of Jeremiah.
<s> Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
<s> Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
<s> It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
<s> Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
<s> I'll be fine here.
<s> "Blood?"
<s> People say he was a murderer.
<s> I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
<s> Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
<s> Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
<s> Who you callin' "boy?"
<s> What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
<s> Yeah. That sounds good. "Hang a left at the first cow patty, then make a right when you see porky pig".
<s> This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
<s> Let it go.
<s> I said that's enough!
<s> Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
<s> Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
<s> I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.
<s> You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
<s> Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
<s> Jeez, what's the difference? Just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone.
<s> Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
<s> Bill, we need to talk!
<s> Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
<s> Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
<s> I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
<s> We're coming your way, man!
<s> What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
<s> Shelby --
<s> Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
<s> Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
<s> I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
<s> Okay.
<s> It's just one of my students, Grant.
<s> Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
<s> A what?
<s> I give up.
<s> You know, you're not a bad passenger.
<s> I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
<s> Enjoy your Kenworth.
<s> Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.
<s> Ummm?
<s> Yes.
<s> I'll do it.
<s> See.
<s> I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
<s> Because they said it couldn't be done.
<s> This is Bandit I, come back.
<s> On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
<s> What's your twenty?
<s> I'll believe it when I see it.
<s> We'll be waiting. Over.
<s> God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
<s> We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
<s> You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
<s> Yeah, but...
<s> What's your twenty and what's your handle?
<s> Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.
<s> Believe me, that won't be a problem.
<s> -- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
<s> -- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
<s> You have a butler working that floor?
<s> So there are no guests staying on that floor?
<s> All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
<s> Mmm-hmm.
<s> Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
<s> Shoot, I appreciate that man.
<s> I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
<s> I sent Hugo, he should be there!
<s> Your attitude sucks.
<s> Okay.
<s> I was kinda hoping, yeah.
<s> Only if you really, truly mean it.
<s> We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
<s> I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
<s> His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection.
<s> We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.
<s> -- will be handled back in --
<s> And you just figured that out?  The Swede isn't a hitman, is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant... why?
<s> ...So you made another deal?
<s> No... We're trying to save Heller.
<s> Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
<s> Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
<s> Yeah, I can front this.
<s> A million flat.
<s> None whatsoever.
<s> Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
<s> I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
<s> -- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
<s> What?
<s> Leave the light off.
<s> That depends.
<s> To who?
<s> I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
<s> -- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
<s> Not necessarily.
<s> I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
<s> Yes.
<s> I want you inside me right now.
<s> You're talking about a man in a white beard again.  You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.  Human beings look for causes and patterns.  How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything?
<s> I been thinking about how much I hate you.
<s> It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
<s> That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different.
<s> Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
<s> Do you?
<s> I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
<s> I can't stay here.
<s> A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?
<s> You still writing the occasional magazine article?
<s> It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
<s> Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
<s> Can we go then?
<s> Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
<s> Big talk... Desperate guy.
<s> Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
<s> They're kind of fuzzy.
<s> No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
<s> That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
<s> I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
<s> But "nice".
<s> You don't like him, do you?
<s> Tell it like it is.
<s> What do you want?
<s> Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
<s> Do you dance?
<s> ... Don't explain.
<s> Claire...
<s> Sure we are, let's go!
<s> You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
<s> You don't want to hear about it.
<s> Why?
<s> What're you talking about --
<s> I'm all right.
<s> Koontz!  I need you guys!
<s> No, I need'm now!
<s> I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.
<s> Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.
<s> That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
<s> Is she injured?
<s> I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
<s> My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
<s> Yeah, I think so.
<s> I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
<s> They'll never take me alive.
<s> Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
<s> Mm-hmm.
<s> Get away from me, freak!
<s> Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
<s> You make your own luck, Parker! Get into the middle of things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--
<s> Well...
<s> Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
<s> When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
<s> How very dull, Peter Parker.
<s> Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
<s> That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
<s> Oh, God, I forgot to--
<s> Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
<s> It's fine.  Tell me what--
<s> Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
<s> Power down.  I need to talk to you.
<s> I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
<s> No!
<s> No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
<s> I'll try. Thanks.
<s> Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
<s> The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
<s> I'm not so happy myself.
<s> They may. That's why I would keep my mouth shut.
<s> There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
<s> In this barracks?
<s> Anybody here wanna double their bet?
<s> And maybe a little something else?
<s> Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
<s> You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
<s> We're looking at it.
<s> Which one of you is what?
<s> Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
<s> What exactly is he charged with?
<s> He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
<s> All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
<s> Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
<s> Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
<s> It's a mouse trap.
<s> Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
<s> They'll shoot you, Animal!
<s> Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
<s> What's the award?
<s> I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
<s> She'll never forgive me!
<s> Blind? How stupid can you get, Animal? I drank the stuff myself.
<s> Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
<s> Animal! Got a little something for you!
<s> This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
<s> You want to go?
<s> Anything else?
<s> Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?
<s> Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
<s> Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
<s> Give this to Joey, will you?
<s> Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
<s> They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
<s> Thirty-fifth.
<s> Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
<s> You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
<s> Ich weiss alles.
<s> Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
<s> You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
<s> Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
<s> A chicken?
<s> Just don't drool on it.
<s> What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
<s> Where is he?
<s> When is it expected back?
<s> The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
<s> I believe so.
<s> It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
<s> It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
<s> I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong
<s> I hope so, sir.
<s> Beam them directly to Sickbay.
<s> I'll go. You have the Bridge.
<s> For you. This is where you wanted to be.
<s> Why would you want to leave?
<s> I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
<s> Please, please.
<s> Oh, of course.
<s> I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
<s> Better?
<s> I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.
<s> It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
<s> No, sir.
<s> No. Thank you.
<s> In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.
<s> Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...
<s> An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> What did you see, Chekov?
<s> Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
<s> Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
<s> Locate.
<s> On screen.
<s> David!... What went wrong?
<s> ... How long?
<s> I'll go...
<s> You said there wouldn't be any.
<s> Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
<s> I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
<s> Aye, sir!
<s> Saavik... Is... David with you?
<s> But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
<s> I'll need it, Sulu.
<s> Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
<s> Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
<s> Genesis?! Whatever for?
<s> 
<s> One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
<s> Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
<s> Yes, my lord!
<s> How is that...?
<s> More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
<s> Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
<s> Amazing! I don't know what to say --
<s> Thank you.
<s> At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
<s> This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
<s> I have my orders.
<s> I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
<s> Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
<s> Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
<s> I know, I know...
<s> Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
<s> Mother, go back!
<s> But we can't just sit here -- !
<s> There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.
<s> <u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
<s> Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Let them eat static.
<s> We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
<s> <u>Full power damn you</u>!
<s> I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.
<s> A few shots, sir.
<s> He'll die -- !
<s> Admiral, this is Spock.
<s> I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
<s> Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
<s> It would explain a great many things --
<s> Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
<s> The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
<s> Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
<s> Or the one.
<s> Spock...!
<s> Permission to speak candidly, sir?
<s> It is still regulation, Admiral.
<s> Take the test again.
<s> We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...
<s> Phasers on stun. Move out.
<s> Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Hello, Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...
<s> All stop, sir.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> Scotty!
<s> Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
<s> Never, sir.
<s> Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
<s> Where must you go?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
<s> Gillian --
<s> Would you prefer to do nothing?
<s> Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
<s> Come on, Pavel...
<s> It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
<s> Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
<s> That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
<s> Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
<s> No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts.
<s> Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
<s> Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
<s> Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
<s> Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
<s> You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
<s> Is there something wrong with the one I have?
<s> Why's that?
<s> It's his way.
<s> It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
<s> Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
<s> You need me.
<s> Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
<s> You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
<s> Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
<s> Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
<s> That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
<s> What are the variables...?
<s> But you said toxic.
<s> The tank will be finished by morning...
<s> No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
<s> In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
<s> Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
<s> 283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
<s> I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
<s> How long, Scotty?
<s> Mr. Sulu, if you please.
<s> It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
<s> Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
<s> We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
<s> I demand to see the owners! I demand --
<s> Sill? What else would I be working with?
<s> That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
<s> I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
<s> Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
<s> It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
<s> What's the rush?
<s> I thought it might begin the healing process.
<s> You're what?
<s> I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
<s> No one's ever asked me that before.
<s> The artificial lifeform was right?
<s> Yes. But look at this medscan...
<s> Is it safe to move her?
<s> Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
<s> That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
<s> Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
<s> The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
<s> It's nothing. I'm just tired.
<s> We're through running from these bastards.
<s> We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
<s> Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...
<s> Sir?
<s> Make it so.
<s> No, sir...
<s> We have to find shelter...
<s> Is there any other way to disable the injector?
<s> They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline...
<s> Activating injector assembly.
<s> Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
<s> Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
<s> Vulcan?
<s> The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
<s> Ready quantum torpedo.
<s> What?
<s> I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
<s> Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
<s> If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
<s> I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
<s> Active.
<s> Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
<s> Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
<s> I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
<s> Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
<s> Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
<s> 'Fraid not.
<s> You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
<s> No... I'm from France.
<s> Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
<s> We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
<s> Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?
<s> Go to manual.
<s> Onscreen.
<s> They did it... they assimilated Earth.
<s> In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
<s> Unless you'd like to stay.
<s> Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
<s> Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
<s> It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.
<s> They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
<s> Hold that thought.
<s> Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
<s> Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
<s> What kind of message?
<s> The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
<s> We DO sleep lying down.
<s> You heard the order, Lieutenant.
<s> That cunning little Vulcan...
<s> Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
<s> Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
<s> Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
<s> Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
<s> Aye, sir; thrusters...
<s> Second star to the right - and straight on till morning...
<s> Now we go to Starfleet?
<s> She programmed the torpedo hits?
<s> Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
<s> They'll be here...
<s> I like it here...
<s> Anything else you want to tell me?
<s> I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
<s> You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
<s> Uhura, signal our surrender.
<s> When does this conference start?
<s> There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
<s> I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
<s> According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
<s> So, that's it..
<s> What peace conference?
<s> I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn.
<s> In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
<s> I don't want to.
<s> Confirmed, Captain!
<s> I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.
<s> What?
<s> That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.
<s> Maybe we should write them a letter?
<s> Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
<s> But you didn't join a conspiracy.
<s> I know.
<s> Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
<s> About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
<s> Is he very much like you were?
<s> Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...
<s> Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
<s> Sorry, sir.
<s> Divert power and compensate.
<s> Negative.
<s> Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
<s> It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
<s> 
<s> The resemblance is... striking.
<s> I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
<s> Counselor?
<s> This isn't about me anymore.
<s> You sick bastard!
<s> What do we know about the planet?
<s> What do we know about the population?
<s> What programs were accessed?
<s> And that's exactly what he's going to do.
<s> He wants to look me in the eye.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> Ready, sir!
<s> The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
<s> I'll take care of it, sir.
<s> What sort of signature?
<s> If you don't mind.
<s> Who was it?
<s> Counselor?
<s> And the Romulans invade.
<s> I know.
<s> You'll acquire a taste for it.
<s> No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
<s> What's this all about?
<s> I won't defend my life to you.
<s> Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
<s> Long ago.
<s> He is what his life has made him!
<s> Let's go.
<s> My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
<s> FULL STOP AND FIRE !
<s> We should have. Let me see.
<s> Eh... yes.
<s> No.
<s> What the hell do you think you're doing?
<s> There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
<s> I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
<s> Shermin...
<s> We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
<s> You're not hearing me.
<s> No, we don't.
<s> Okay...
<s> Watch it. They're coming out.
<s> No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
<s> Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
<s> Don't... don't do this... please...
<s> Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever...
<s> Which way do you want to go?
<s> Ah no.
<s> Gear shift.
<s> Dashboard.
<s> Good.
<s> Pancakes.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> I am...
<s> Shit?
<s> Shit... shit... what shit?
<s> This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
<s> Music.
<s> Yes. Day... night.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
<s> Yes?
<s> It was a mistake.
<s> He will.
<s> Yes. Sing some more.
<s> You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
<s> I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
<s> No.
<s> I understand.
<s> I understand.  Thank you.
<s> This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
<s> I understand.
<s> You want the baby to laugh at me.
<s> This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
<s> I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
<s> Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
<s> Doesn't make sense.
<s> People have made mistakes in these situations before.
<s> It was only an accident that we discovered them.
<s> Twenty-eight years.
<s> Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
<s> It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
<s> Leave him alone, Tran.
<s> Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
<s> I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
<s> What?  He gonna record you on his label?
<s> Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!
<s> Yeah.  No, not really.
<s> Where's Faith?
<s> I won't say anything.
<s> Naawww.
<s> Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
<s> Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
<s> What clip?  What was it?
<s> I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?
<s> They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
<s> Fumitsu.
<s> Coming with you.
<s> I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
<s> Get it.
<s> It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
<s> Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
<s> Wants to share.
<s> So that gives you something.
<s> Sure.
<s> This tie doesn't go with blue!
<s> Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
<s> It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
<s> Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
<s> People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
<s> Well, look at the plus side.
<s> It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
<s> This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
<s> Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
<s> Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
<s> I'm sorry. This won't take long.
<s> I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
<s> Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
<s> You must travel a lot, huh?
<s> Whole country or just hereabouts?
<s> Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
<s> Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
<s> What do you want from me?
<s> Maybe cause he's smart.
<s> If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
<s> I don't believe this.
<s> I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
<s> Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
<s> The Academy, then CIIAC.
<s> Not especially.
<s> The other reason?
<s> Sex.
<s> My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
<s> Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
<s> Don't be too harsh.
<s> Huh?
<s> "Intra-Agency fraternizing."
<s> We did find these, however.
<s> No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
<s> You did.
<s> Not the way I can.
<s> Koessler doesn't know any of this?
<s> Yeah, of course.
<s> Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me.
<s> I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
<s> Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
<s> Who told you about her?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Something came up, Murman, my man.
<s> [Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
<s> [Not the heart, the watch.]
<s> [Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
<s> [What does the file say?]
<s> [And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
<s> [I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
<s> I screwed up twice, sir.
<s> Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
<s> You're a comedian?
<s> Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
<s> Uh, if the guy wants to.
<s> I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
<s> I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
<s> Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
<s> ...I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud...
<s> Did you get it?
<s> Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
<s> There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
<s> I would love to see you again sometime.
<s> That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
<s> Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
<s> ...Six months.
<s> Really?
<s> ...the Michelin commercial...
<s> I heard you might be moving back...
<s> Right.
<s> It sucks.
<s> Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
<s> What do you want? You're tall.
<s> What'd you get?
<s> ..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
<s> Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup.
<s> You asshole.
<s> She's really special, guys.
<s> Wow, I guess you were home... 
<s> I don't know...
<s> What Vegas?
<s> What?
<s> Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
<s> I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
<s> But I lost! How can you say always?!?
<s> Thanks for clarifying that.
<s> Did she, or did she not smile.
<s> Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
<s> You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
<s> ...gotta...
<s> That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
<s> I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
<s> ...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
<s> Minnie Pearl.
<s> She didn't notice.
<s> We're not messing with you...
<s> Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
<s> You could make their heads bleed, though.
<s> ...double diamond...
<s> You are so money, and you don't even know it...
<s> Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
<s> I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
<s> Good.  He never doubted you.
<s> America has been good to me...
<s> You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.
<s> The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
<s> So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
<s> When did he call?
<s> Should I bring him in.
<s> They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
<s> I'm going to finish school.
<s> A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
<s> How did you find out?
<s> I'll need him.
<s> Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
<s> Yes.
<s> This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
<s> Come Sunday morning:  My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village.
<s> He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.
<s> No.
<s> Come here a minute, Fredo.
<s> I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
<s> No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
<s> Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
<s> Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
<s> Can you do it Mike?
<s> You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
<s> Did he give you his politicians?
<s> How will they come at you?
<s> They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
<s> Sure.
<s> As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
<s> Huh?
<s> When will I see you again?
<s> I'm busy.
<s> All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
<s> You've read about my father in the papers.  You've seen that no one's here to guard him.  Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him.  Believe me and help me.
<s> Until the old man tells me different.
<s> Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
<s> Just be patient.
<s> You're unlucky.
<s> What are you doing in Mongi?
<s> Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
<s> Oh, it was.
<s> Okay.
<s> It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
<s> Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
<s> That's funny.
<s> I love jazz.
<s> He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
<s> I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
<s> I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
<s> To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
<s> I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
<s> I love Marge.
<s> Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.
<s> We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
<s> Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
<s> Thanks, yes, I think we did.
<s> Bird. That's jazz.
<s> Frances?
<s> Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
<s> I think you're right.
<s> Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
<s> My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
<s> Get on. I'll take you to him.
<s> I don't believe a single word you've said.
<s> I think we sort of found each other.
<s> I'll take them both.
<s> Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you.
<s> Not at all. Morning Tom.
<s> But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
<s> That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.
<s> It's okay.
<s> You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
<s> I'll fix some drinks.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> You try. You try talking to her.
<s> Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
<s> Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
<s> I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
<s> Peter, I... I...
<s> Postmortem?
<s> Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
<s> Even your fiance...?
<s> November 7th is my information.
<s> I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
<s> Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
<s> I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"
<s> The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.
<s> If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
<s> I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
<s> It keeps ya busy.
<s> I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
<s> No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
<s> I'm leaving.
<s> I mean porno movies.
<s> Hello, Betsy.
<s> Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
<s> This is gotta be a game, right?
<s> Ouch!
<s> Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
<s> I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
<s> Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
<s> No.
<s> I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
<s> I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
<s> I don't like my real name.
<s> Iris.
<s> It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
<s> Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
<s> Where is home?
<s> I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
<s> Damn straight.
<s> I can't sleep nights.
<s> How's your driving record?
<s> Education?
<s> We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
<s> Well then check back tomorrow.
<s> What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
<s> Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
<s> O.K., cowboy.
<s> Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
<s> Yeah?
<s> The taxi life, you mean.
<s> Travis, look, I dig it. Let me explain. You choose a certain way of life. You live it. It becomes what you are. I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab. I guess that's the way I want it.  You see, that must be what I am.
<s> You want to talk about it?
<s> Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
<s> Wrong.
<s> I'm not a fool, Billy.
<s> You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
<s> Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
<s> Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
<s> No hiccups, which was good.  Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  "Your  honor, I  object!"
<s> You mean,  me?
<s> Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
<s> You must not remember anything. Come on.
<s> Why me?
<s> Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
<s> I don't smoke?
<s> Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
<s> No... I can't... I have to... I can't...
<s> Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right.
<s> We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
<s> I'm not refuting anything.
<s> We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
<s> Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
<s> Harry, son.  Harry.
<s> Nine and-a-half years...
<s> Mother.  She's beautiful.
<s> Oh.  What... what time is it?
<s> Oh, hi Cue... Carl.  Sorry.
<s> Yes?
<s> Oh, no, I...
<s> Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
<s> What.
<s> Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
<s> Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
<s> Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
<s> Then I'll call you a cab.
<s> Call me... Ishmael?
<s> We live in a theater?
<s> Hey, it's the best way to tell.
<s> What's his rent?
<s> I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
<s> So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
<s> Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
<s> You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
<s> Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
<s> Oh...
<s> No.  No, not Miss Sinclair.  I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
<s> No. Just a few hours.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
<s> When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
<s> Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
<s> I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
<s> Well, I suppose...
<s> I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
<s> Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
<s> I think they'll be all right, honey.
<s> The little Brenner girl.
<s> Yep.
<s> Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
<s> Alice, I think.  Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?
<s> Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
<s> Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
<s> I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
<s> I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
<s> No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
<s> I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
<s> I know exactly what I want, Mother.
<s> You're doing fine.
<s> But they'll be back.
<s> If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
<s> What?
<s> Annie's there. She'll be all right.
<s> Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
<s> Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
<s> We know what it is, Al.
<s> What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know? Ain't much we can do about it. 
<s> No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?
<s> Monday?
<s> Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
<s> I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
<s> I'm awfully sorry.
<s> I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
<s> I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
<s> A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
<s> I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
<s> You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
<s> Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
<s> How do you know Annie?
<s> I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
<s> I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
<s> Famished.
<s> Yes, but...
<s> It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
<s> Like what?
<s> Take wing!
<s> With my little sparrow leading team.
<s> We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
<s> I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.
<s> Hello, Miss Daniels.
<s> I have no idea.
<s> What? Oh, yes, certainly.
<s> I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!
<s> Then let's go. Now!
<s> I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
<s> Did he tell you about Georgina?
<s> I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
<s> I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
<s> I've heard of it.
<s> But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
<s> Well? And are you not a good student?
<s> Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --
<s> What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
<s> I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
<s> Wait, Doctor -- wait!  The child's fainting.
<s> That's only our duty, Fettes -- that's the end at which we aim with all this nasty business.
<s> But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
<s> The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
<s> I want it --
<s> Your son, ma'am?  He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.
<s> A doctor?
<s> Don't call me that confounded name.
<s> Maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours.  Say that you'll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here.
<s> That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
<s> The nerve centers -- the brain --
<s> I've ordered nothing from you.
<s> I have other means of sustenance.
<s> Burke them?
<s> I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
<s> A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
<s> But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
<s> You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
<s> I'll get him.
<s> I'm looking for my friends.
<s> You're wrong.
<s> Tell her... we'll get him.
<s> Yeah. I sure will.
<s> A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
<s> I don't know you, man.
<s> They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
<s> A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
<s> You're the guy killed Dutton.
<s> Someone else did it.
<s> My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
<s> I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
<s> No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
<s> You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
<s> She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
<s> Let's hope not. License and registration please.
<s> This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
<s> Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
<s> Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
<s> I don't believe you.
<s> Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
<s> What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
<s> Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
<s> That was my first question.
<s> That's what I came to see you about.
<s> I assure you such power exists.
<s> Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
<s> No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.
<s> Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
<s> Gee! How could they make a landing?
<s> You're just kidding, aren't you?
<s> Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
<s> Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
<s> You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
<s> How long will I live?  That no one can say.
<s> I'd give you a very good price.
<s> In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
<s> It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
<s> Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
<s> We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
<s> That's just the way we like it.
<s> You don't have to beat me, Michael.  Just try to keep up.
<s> You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
<s> That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin.  Let's stake 'em.
<s> I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
<s> It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
<s> I told Max eight o'clock.
<s> Whatcha doin' over here?
<s> No.  Just you.
<s> I like Michael.
<s> He's just a deep sleeper.
<s> I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
<s> Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
<s> Gotta go, Mom.
<s> Michael!...
<s> Soon.
<s> C'mere, Nanook.
<s> Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
<s> Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
<s> No... no, everything's different now...
<s> They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
<s> Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
<s> The Marines.
<s> I... I don't feel any differently.  Do you?
<s> Just listen.
<s> Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
<s> If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
<s> Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
<s> Finish what?
<s> Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
<s> We'll see...
<s> Now who'd go and do...
<s> What's it going to do, being a plant?
<s> Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker?  I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them.
<s> That's good enough.
<s> How the fuck do I know?!
<s> We ain't buying that.
<s> Smart S.O.B.  He put it together piece by piece.
<s> If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
<s> In this weather?
<s> When was the last time you used it?
<s> After all this mess.
<s> That far?
<s> Well, stick to it.
<s> Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
<s> Don't let up, Childs!
<s> Could anyone have gotten it from you?
<s> What are you going to do?  Drink it?
<s> Everything that's been missing.
<s> We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
<s> So what do you make of it?
<s> MacReady, that you?
<s> It's the generator I think!  No power.
<s> What happened?
<s> 1899.
<s> Can you show us where they live?
<s> Kalen... hold on a minute.
<s> It frightens you.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> I'll never forget this.
<s> How?
<s> I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
<s> Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
<s> A man can change his history.
<s> I'm a foolish man.
<s> I know.
<s> Oh, you won't be running for long...
<s> I mean... well... affection.
<s> Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
<s> The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
<s> Let them.
<s> Do you know you were humming?
<s> Tonight's the night?
<s> You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
<s> That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
<s> There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
<s> In a week... we will never have had this conversation.
<s> His home.
<s> Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
<s> Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
<s> More than 800,000 years.
<s> Yes.
<s> I can see Kalen's point.
<s> You lost someone.
<s> Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
<s> My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
<s> Do you have it?!
<s> Tell him to go away --
<s> I see.
<s> Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
<s> Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
<s> What are your people called?
<s> New Yorkers.
<s> I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
<s> We don't know.
<s> We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.
<s> Dean Fulton...
<s> I'm fine.
<s> We never should have done this to him...
<s> In where?
<s> Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
<s> Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
<s> I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
<s> No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
<s> His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
<s> Why?
<s> After I...
<s> What?
<s> I know.
<s> No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
<s> Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
<s> There're no cars on this street.
<s> [Beat] I don't know.
<s> William, you're not making sense.
<s> You're bleeding pretty bad there.
<s> I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
<s> It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
<s> I still don't either, even after all these years.
<s> I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
<s> I guess I'd ask you why.
<s> I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
<s> Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
<s> Maybe.
<s> I did?
<s> What for?
<s> Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
<s> No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
<s> [Beat] Thanks.
<s> Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
<s> Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
<s> No, I'm ok.
<s> You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.
<s> Sure.
<s> Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
<s> I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
<s> What.
<s> See ya.
<s> I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
<s> I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
<s> Umm, yes.  She was driving.
<s> You might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes.
<s> Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
<s> Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
<s> Louise, I'll do anything.  I know what's makin' you run.  I know what happened to you in Texas.
<s> Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
<s> I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something.
<s> You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause if he is, then he and I got somethin' in common.
<s> Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
<s> Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.
<s> Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care.
<s> She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
<s> Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
<s> Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...
<s> Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
<s> It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel.  The address is 1921 North East 23.  It's under your name.
<s> It's nothin' like that.
<s> Jimmy... it's beautiful!
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
<s> Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
<s> We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
<s> Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
<s> Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
<s> So this is all my fault, is it.
<s> I don't know.  I won't be.
<s> I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
<s> Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
<s> Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
<s> Nothing.  It got messed up.
<s> Yes!  I believe I am!
<s> Yeah.
<s> Let's get it over with.
<s> I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
<s> Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
<s> Okay, Louise... It's okay.
<s> I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
<s> Hit it.
<s> Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
<s> That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
<s> No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
<s> Did you see that guy?!  He was right in the middle of the road!
<s> No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
<s> Where?!
<s> It's grand!
<s> What are you talkin' about?
<s> Say you're sorry.
<s> You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
<s> Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
<s> I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
<s> Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
<s> Hey, look on the bright side --
<s> No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
<s> No.
<s> Huh.
<s> But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
<s> Who?
<s> Loser? Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class.
<s> You got a brew?
<s> No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
<s> Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
<s> Thanks.
<s> No I can't.
<s> Am I?
<s> Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
<s> Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
<s> Ahh.
<s> Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
<s> I already know it, Mary.
<s> Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
<s> Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
<s> The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
<s> Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
<s> Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
<s> Have you seen it?
<s> -- Love story of our time.
<s> Huh... that's strange.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Well, I know you're busy...
<s> Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
<s> Really?  Very, very?
<s> Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
<s> Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna.
<s> Do what?
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> What?
<s> Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
<s> And you met Mary how?
<s> Fucking sickening.
<s> Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
<s> You were following us?
<s> That must make it tough.
<s> Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
<s> What's that supposed to mean?
<s> No I'm not.
<s> Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
<s> These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
<s> That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
<s> I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
<s> Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
<s> Where's Puffy?
<s> Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
<s> No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
<s> Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
<s> No no no, Tucker, thank you.
<s> Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
<s> No, it's an old football injury.
<s> Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
<s> You betcha!
<s> Really? I never got a message.
<s> Hm?
<s> Oh great, I ran out.
<s> Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Trying to be.
<s> We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
<s> All right, let's go.
<s> Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
<s> You're Woogie?
<s> You forgot your keys!
<s> I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a baseball.
<s> You got what stuck?
<s> So what's up?
<s> Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
<s> What are you doing?
<s> We've got bigger problems right now.
<s> Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
<s> -- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.
<s> He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
<s> -- Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I told you how stupid it was to float the Lippman article! But you wouldn't listen to me. What if there hasn't been a coup at all? What if it's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade?
<s> Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
<s> I think it's a bad idea.
<s> -- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Time is of the essence.
<s> 48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.
<s> Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
<s> Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
<s> Forget it, Scotty.
<s> And we can't purge the Chiefs. Our invasion talk will look like a bluff. Or even that there's been an attempted coup.
<s> Yeah, a good political solution.
<s> You're sure...
<s> Okay, Ken. We're going.
<s> You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.
<s> That may be what they want us to think.
<s> Hey. Nice tie.
<s> Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
<s> The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
<s> Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.
<s> We'll have to give Leo a refund. Because he's gotta go to the M.E. In case you don't know, Officer, violation of the Major Crimes Act on --
<s> I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
<s> Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> Cooch. You're my hero.
<s> Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
<s> She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
<s> Let's see it.
<s> Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
<s> Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar.
<s> Yes.
<s> Let's go.
<s> She's your sister?
<s> What you call myths, we call our history.
<s> Likewise.
<s> We're in there. We're in there --
<s> You bought her some time, Kola. Ain't never gonna be over... but you bought her some time.
<s> You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
<s> Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
<s> Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.
<s> Good.
<s> I'm on my way back in. Over.
<s> Well, it is. It is that, too.
<s> What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
<s> I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
<s> Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
<s> You know. The finger.
<s> No.
<s> Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
<s> Evan... or Maverick.
<s> How about anything, anything you want to do.
<s> I'm starting to sense that now.
<s> You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
<s> All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
<s> Where?
<s> He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
<s> I was flying...my responsibility.
<s> What do you want?
<s> What?
<s> It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
<s> Take something off.
<s> Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
<s> Well?
<s> F-14's sir.
<s> What is?
<s> No! Now we're inverted!
<s> NO. NO GOOD.
<s> Rudder's left, stick's forward.
<s> Any more MiGs?
<s> So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was a good man.
<s> Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.
<s> Right.
<s> Nothing. Let's just go fight.
<s> Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on!
<s> They should have warned you about that one.
<s> Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
<s> What now?
<s> Nope.
<s> It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
<s> I talked a man back once. Three months later, we lost him. It's his decision. Only he knows.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> No bother.
<s> You think I should quit?!
<s> But maybe you can change all that.
<s> My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.
<s> Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
<s> No, sir.
<s> I know that.
<s> Come on...put his head in place.
<s> Hetero.
<s> Brunette.
<s> At Rekall.
<s> Where?
<s> Melina!
<s> Harry!
<s> Come on, let's go have that drink.
<s> What the hell is this?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Bye.
<s> Doug...
<s> I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
<s> Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
<s> You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".
<s> Aaah, let me tantalize you.  You're a top operative, back under deep cover on your most important mission.  People are trying to kill you left and right. You meet a beautiful, exotic woman...
<s> What's he talking about?
<s> There's something I have to tell you...
<s> Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
<s> Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
<s> He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
<s> I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
<s> Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
<s> Enough for everybody to breathe?
<s> Some kind of mutation...?
<s> No problem.
<s> Burt, can you hear me now?
<s> Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
<s> Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
<s> No.  We go straight.
<s> I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.
<s> In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
<s> One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
<s> Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
<s> Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
<s> You got <u>that</u> right!
<s> First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
<s> Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
<s> I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.
<s> Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
<s> I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
<s> Not yet, not yet...
<s> No ties.
<s> You are so full of shit...
<s> Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
<s> They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
<s> Yeah.  One, two, three...
<s> Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
<s> Why do you all keep asking me?
<s> LET'S DO IT!
<s> Please... I need to sleep...
<s> That-a-boy. Hospital.
<s> Correct.
<s> Complain to the Bar Commission.
<s> Do you see a toilet here you think is really me?
<s> Shut your sewer mouth!
<s> No. No...
<s> Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
<s> I specialize, Roger...
<s> I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
<s> So go take your job on Wall Street.
<s> You really think that's what happened?
<s> What, the lunatic who --
<s> Roger Baron.
<s> What's Art Esparza?
<s> You're doing a murder case?
<s> But I like that theory. And since I'm not putting Twerp Professor on the stand, and since I don't have a better theory, I'm sticking with that theory. Meantime I want pictures of the Joes. What'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses!
<s> Right.
<s> About Chinatown. What went down.
<s> "No," what?
<s> When I joined up I took an oath of secrecy. I told you what you needed to know.
<s> That's right.
<s> You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu.
<s> -- alleged crime --
<s> The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
<s> -- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
<s> I would tend to plead the Fifth.
<s> Soldado.
<s> Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
<s> The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
<s> I want you to kill for me.
<s> You killed Mike.
<s> Oh.
<s> Sorry to hear it.
<s> Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
<s> What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
<s> Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
<s> I'll get my kit.
<s> He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
<s> Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
<s> No, you're the muffin.
<s> No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
<s> Nothing.
<s> YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
<s> I'm not.
<s> James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
<s> You know it and I know it.
<s> You mean the ones you pity.
<s> What?
<s> Trees?
<s> They were looking for wood.
<s> That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
<s> Mom, take it easy.
<s> Not really.
<s> Look at this finger here.
<s> That's right.
<s> Nothing.
<s> As far as we know, nothing.
<s> Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
<s> Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
<s> Yes. It would be.
<s> And no one will know the truth.
<s> To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
<s> I wouldn't do it.
<s> I...
<s> 'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
<s> Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
<s> Huh!
<s> You may step down.
<s> ...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
<s> 'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
<s> I understand.  I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
<s> It was good of you to meet...
<s> In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
<s> That's perfectly all right. I'm kind of rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
<s> How old is he?
<s> That's a wonderful profession. My daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did you do, stop?
<s> Yes...
<s> These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
<s> Ready, your Honor.
<s> Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
<s> My ex-husband was a lawyer.
<s> Yes. It was, actually.
<s> Is there going to be a later...?
<s> Kathy Price.
<s> It's locked.
<s> Yes. Yes, I have.
<s> He's not in, Sir.
<s> I'm going to help her.
<s> I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
<s> Oh shit, what's today?
<s> Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
<s> Yeah. I'm awake.
<s> The Doctors.
<s> Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
<s> We got to talk.
<s> I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
<s> She did?
<s> You saw Kat in New York...  ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
<s> We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
<s> Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
<s> Let's go.
<s> There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
<s> What's he like?
<s> I didn't know how to stop you...!
<s> There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?
<s> Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
<s> You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
<s> It's gone now.
<s> Don't you live at home?
<s> But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
<s> I liked him.
<s> I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
<s> Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
<s> I wonder if they're going through this too...?
<s> How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
<s> It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
<s> Right.
<s> So is the town, I notice!
<s> They'll probably move at dawn.
<s> I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.
<s> Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
<s> Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
<s> I don't follow.
<s> No biggie, really.
<s> You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
<s> Chase, you'd better come home.
<s> Chase, it's Dylan!
<s> Like what?
<s> Heather, has there been another call?
<s> No.
<s> Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him.  Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
<s> He sleepwalks, you idiot!  He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital.  Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home...
<s> Finish, please!
<s> I like this story.
<s> No.  Tonight.  It's important!
<s> Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
<s> Right 'cross the freeway.
<s> Here.
<s> Read me some?
<s> Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
<s> Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
<s> That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
<s> Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
<s> Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
<s> John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  I'm gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me, John?  Please!
<s> Yes?
<s> No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
<s> Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
<s> By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
<s> Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
<s> Do you let your child watch your movies?
<s> Maybe we should ask him, hmmm?  We've got a surprised, Heather.  A great big surprise for you and our audience.
<s> Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
<s> He has a lot of hurt inside him.
<s> My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
<s> Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> You're not a moron.
<s> Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
<s> Figured what out?
<s> Because it looks good.
<s> What's the difference?
<s> Well that's just typical isn't it?
<s> I know enough.
<s> That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
<s> No, I didn't.
<s> I know you will.
<s> Fine.
<s> Come on man, what'd they look like?
<s> My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?"
<s> Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep.
<s> I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
<s> Sir...?
<s> I don't know.
<s> No.
<s> I know.
<s> This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed.
<s> Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
<s> Why are you here?
<s> They'll know about it in the morning.
<s> She's Cuban.
<s> Why would you do that?
<s> I couldn't do it.
<s> Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
<s> Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.
<s> Joy, rapture...
<s> You already have.  Now go on.  Do it.
<s> I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
<s> Yes, I was.
<s> ... and that you invited him to strike you?  To fight it out on the deck of your ship?!
<s> I understand.
<s> It wasn't hard.
<s> How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
<s> Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
<s> Yessir.
<s> Well... Yeah - okay.
<s> Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
<s> Ready for another?
<s> Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
<s> When did you talk to Lula?
<s> Forty bucks...
<s> That's right... Take one of these.
<s> Whattaya do there?
<s> We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.
<s> United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.
<s> She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
<s> Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
<s> Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
<s> Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
<s> The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
<s> He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
<s> No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
<s> I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
<s> Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em...  Now tell me...
<s> Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
<s> You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?
<s> Didn't he say somethin'?
<s> One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a '54 Ford Pick-Up and a '64 Chevy Station Wagon. No survivors. Balls of flame and grinding metal.
<s> Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
<s> Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
<s> We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
<s> Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
<s> We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
<s> No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
<s> It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.
<s> Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
<s> Gotta hex from a voodoo?
<s> Lula, darlin'... Makes no difference anyway... We're outta here.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
<s> That'd be good, Lula.
<s> This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
<s> Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
<s> We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
<s> Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.
<s> My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
<s> Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
<s> I'm afraid she is, baby.
<s> Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.
<s> No radio or TV...
<s> Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
<s> We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
<s> That was in Vietnam.
<s> Lula, he mighta did, I don't know. But it don't matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault.
<s> Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
<s> Shake hands with your daddy.
<s> Damn!
<s> Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
<s> What time's Sailor's train get in?
<s> Santos... It isn't.
<s> What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
<s> I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
<s> In the head.
<s> Yes.
<s> See! I knew you had it all under control.
<s> No...
<s> Shhhhhh...  Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now...
<s> No.
<s> Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
<s> Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
<s> Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
<s> I sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling.
<s> Perfect. Well then, shall we?
<s> Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
<s> Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
<s> Because... because...
<s> He heard everything we were saying.
<s> What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
<s> Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
<s> What's to tell?
<s> 'That's my car, motherfucker.'
<s> No wonder he screwed us over.
<s> Gee, I don't know, Crabs...  Improvise. You're good at that.
<s> I peeked.
<s> Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.
<s> I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
<s> I just want you to know that's why I dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo- Faulknerian nobody.
<s> You must be mistaken.
<s> Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
<s> Shoot.
<s> It's very convincing.
<s> ...You carry firearms.
<s> No! What gave you that idea?
<s> You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
<s> A little.
<s> That's really it.
<s> I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
<s> What'd you tell him?
<s> That's a big book you're writing.
<s> Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
<s> I guess there's probably a story behind that.
<s> So where have you been staying?
<s> Kinship.
<s> That's right. That one.
<s> I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
<s> I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
<s> Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
<s> I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
<s> Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
<s> Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.
<s> James, like it or not, they're your parents.
<s> I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
<s> Ah, wear whatever you want.
<s> I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.
<s> I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.
<s> Uh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence.'
<s> Chancellor.
<s> I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
<s> Is the thing -- is it over?
<s> You got me.
<s> I heard.
<s> James Leer.
<s> I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
<s> Dozens. It's very sad.
<s> Oh?
<s> Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.
<s> James is... I don't know...
<s> Jesus. Is that what he told you?
<s> Her husband.
<s> I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
<s> I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
<s> Just kidding.
<s> I doubt it, darling.
<s> I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
<s> Something wrong with that?
<s> Mariners are pounding the shit out of the Tigers.
<s> The birthday party.
<s> I'm not a monster.
<s> I have no idea.
<s> Got something to hide?
<s> I could get a search warrant.
<s> Who said I wanted to buy it?
<s> What?
<s> They grow outside, don't they?
<s> Fairy tales?
<s> Little Red Riding Hood.
<s> What?
<s> Know what?
<s> No.
<s> I could take you downtown.
<s> I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
<s> I have a passionate girlfriend.
<s> I'm adjusting okay.
<s> Apartment's okay.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.
<s> Would you like to sit on my lap?
<s> Do you like it when he asks you?
<s> Ms. Kramer.
<s> I can't.
<s> What?
<s> Ev-i-dence.
<s> Of course.
<s> Reflect.
<s> You think reflection is good.
<s> How's that?
<s> Honest? No.
<s> I don't feel anything.
<s> If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
<s> Why?
<s> I see my sister.
<s> Did you and your sister often take naps together?
<s> All right.
<s> This is garbage!
<s> That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
<s> Sorry.
<s> You're still here.
<s> What for?
<s> How young?
<s> Hey, I'm not --
<s> Why young girls, Walter?
<s> I was always the one seduced.
<s> You must hate your brothers.
<s> Just think about it.
<s> I'm not scared.
<s> Not when they fly.
<s> What is that?  You drop your dive light?
<s> Hey, you okay?
<s> Your rig?
<s> That must be it.
<s> You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple. Aren't you clever?  You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.
<s> I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
<s> What do you think he saw?
<s> Cute, Virgil.
<s> Yeah?  Well I'm not.
<s> How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
<s> Chill out, Lindsey!!
<s> They'll come out after us.
<s> What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
<s> NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
<s> It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.
<s> Tell me later.
<s> Hi, lady.
<s> God, I hate that bitch.
<s> Why bring it here?
<s> Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
<s> We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
<s> That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
<s> Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
<s> Wait for what?
<s> This one is gorgeous.
<s> It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
<s> Well, what?
<s> How should I be ... arrogant?
<s> Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too dangerous.
<s> And why haven't they left each other?
<s> I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
<s> Occasionally, but always with affection.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
<s> Who knows why they all left...
<s> And why did you drop them?
<s> So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.
<s> Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
<s> As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square.
<s> So, you wonder why?
<s> Why?
<s> I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him. And as far as telephoning him... Who knows where he is?
<s> Better dead.
<s> One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
<s> It was futile. We went all over.
<s> I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
<s> I detest comparisons made with oil.
<s> You must know your third grade geography book inside out.
<s> Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
<s> He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
<s> When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
<s> Then let's get started... It's senseless to waste any more time.
<s> We'll try again.
<s> But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
<s> No, not like this one.
<s> Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
<s> At this time of the year there are so many boats...
<s> If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue...
<s> Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
<s> Agnes...
<s> Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
<s> You've got to eat something Agnes.
<s> Yes, of God.
<s> Dear Jesus...
<s> It made them holy.
<s> Yes, Mother.
<s> I don't know... I don't know...
<s> What would you like to talk about.
<s> Yes.
<s> Did it hurt?
<s> In the middle of all the pain?
<s> Is that where they say it came from... ?
<s> Yes I do,  but I want you to...
<s> I've stopped menstruating
<s> I don't know.
<s> No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
<s> Yes.
<s> A mistake...
<s> I can't help it if I'm stupid.
<s> Not my fault.
<s> I'm always bad.
<s> I breathed!
<s> Yes.
<s> She says my whole body's a mistake.
<s> Her headaches.
<s> And then...
<s> Of what?
<s> But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
<s> It came out of me.
<s> Yes.
<s> I can't tell you that.
<s> I'm afraid.
<s> They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
<s> Yes.
<s> Agnes who did you see?
<s> What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
<s> Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
<s> I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.
<s> Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
<s> Not any more... now I like chocolate.
<s> I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
<s> Obviously there was.
<s> It's possible isn't it?
<s> But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
<s> What?
<s> ... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
<s> What is it?
<s> I don't think I care to know.
<s> Oh God, if only I'd known.
<s> The woman's health is at stake.
<s> I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
<s> No, it reminds me.
<s> Would it stop you if I did?
<s> One that will ask the questions you want asked.
<s> My God, you're as crazy as...
<s> But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
<s> That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
<s> Why do you insist upon pressing...
<s> Is it because she's a nun?
<s> I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
<s> I left it with her and I went for help.
<s> ... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...
<s> Bet you're only eight and a half.
<s> Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
<s> Just you?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'll murder that Lennon.
<s> No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
<s> No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.
<s> Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
<s> Of course I can.
<s> Yeah, grotesque.
<s> You crawler.
<s> Sorry.
<s> No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
<s> Yes.
<s> I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
<s> Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
<s> Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
<s> Yeah ... that's right.
<s> Yeah ... what's in it for me?
<s> Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
<s> Lip reading.
<s> Is there a fire, then?
<s> You see, sly villains.
<s> Why do you always use your left hand?
<s> Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.
<s> We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
<s> You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
<s> Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
<s> Like what?
<s> Aye, before anyone stops us.
<s> You're a swine, isn't he George?
<s> Please, can I have one to surge with?
<s> Come on speedy!
<s> Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.
<s> He'll get over it.
<s> Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
<s> Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
<s> Someone put it on me.
<s> You were twanging too loud.
<s> I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
<s> Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.
<s> Or something will be able to see us.
<s> Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
<s> There are no commercial lanes out here.  Face it, we're out of range.
<s> Activated.  Vertical drop checked. Correcting course.  On tangential course now, orbiting.  Crossing the terminator.  Entering night side.
<s> Then take her down.
<s> Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
<s> I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
<s> That way.
<s> Damn it!  How long to fix?
<s> Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
<s> I kind of like it.
<s> I hope not.
<s> <u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
<s> It wouldn't come.
<s> Careful, don't get under it!
<s> How's Broussard?
<s> It's time for drastic remedies.
<s> I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled.
<s> You will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  Only four forms are shown.  After that the pattern repeats.
<s> Feast your eyes.
<s> All right.  Now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise.  Martin, do you read me?
<s> That creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it...
<s> We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
<s> About four hours.
<s> Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
<s> Right.  Fire up all systems.
<s> Well, it's finally happened.
<s> Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?
<s> I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history.
<s> Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he?  We can see what happened to him.
<s> They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
<s> Up one kilometer, Jay.
<s> Quit complaining; we're in space.
<s> All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
<s> Can we get to him?
<s> Here, carry these.
<s> It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
<s> Who gets the privilege?
<s> And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
<s> I'll get you out of there.
<s> Is it dead?
<s> Oh man...
<s> Okay, give me the numbers.
<s> What?  What's wrong?  What is it?
<s> And?
<s> Get her on-line.  Now!
<s> Has anybody talked to them?
<s> Do it.
<s> About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
<s> One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
<s> What?
<s> Okay.
<s> Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.
<s> Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.
<s> You've checked that end?
<s> We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
<s> I... I can't!
<s> Yes. I do.
<s> Frankly - yes.
<s> Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
<s> I'm in love with Lloyd!
<s> We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
<s> Yes, Addison.
<s> You can have one at Max's.
<s> Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
<s> Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for.
<s> That's how you met me. In passing.
<s> Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
<s> It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
<s> Frankly, I don't remember.
<s> A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
<s> The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
<s> We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning?
<s> Maybe just a little around the edges.
<s> Everything... everything's so funny...
<s> Show me a human and I might have!
<s> Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
<s> Huh?
<s> I'll try.
<s> Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
<s> A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
<s> I get a party, don't I?
<s> She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
<s> To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you, Eve?
<s> I thought you were going to be late-
<s> So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
<s> Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
<s> - guilty.
<s> Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?
<s> Eve?  How enchanting...  Wherever did you get the idea of having Eve read with Miss Caswell?
<s> Now don't get carried away-
<s> You've been all through that with Lloyd-
<s> What would you like? Texas?
<s> I just wondered.
<s> Also Addison deWitt.
<s> Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
<s> You shouldn't have had any doubts.
<s> So am I.
<s> When I told you what every young actress should know.
<s> You're quite a girl.
<s> Behind in your dues? How much?
<s> Night an' day.
<s> Don't be dense. The party.
<s> What report? To whom?
<s> Subway.
<s> With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
<s> But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
<s> Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
<s> Don't get up.  And don't act as if I were the queen mother.
<s> I wish I could believe that.
<s> Over my dead body...
<s> Well, teacher's away and actors will be actors...
<s> Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
<s> - and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
<s> Really, Eve? Why?
<s> What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
<s> None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
<s> You're Margo. Just - Margo.
<s> Isn't that what they always say?
<s> Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
<s> Don't give it another thought, one of destiny's many pranks. After all, you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank...
<s> Loud.
<s> And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
<s> What is?
<s> When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
<s> That was a pity...
<s> I wonder why.
<s> Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
<s> Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
<s> They'd die without each other.
<s> Such as?
<s> Margo!
<s> I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
<s> Margo, you haven't got any age.
<s> You'd have been proud of her.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
<s> City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...
<s> You know, she probably means well, after all...
<s> I just played it.
<s> This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
<s> --it was bullshit the way it was--
<s> It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
<s> Let me lay a little theory on you--
<s> Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
<s> --fifteen phone calls--
<s> That happens to people.  OK, go on.
<s> You want me to be the bastard.
<s> Nothing--I just found out that Jeb Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike freak than I am.  I never like it when the other guy's human...
<s> Then he's got an ax.  Call him anyway.
<s> The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
<s> So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
<s> You asking would I have been one of the President's men?  I would have been.
<s> It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
<s> --to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
<s> The telephone calls... we know about that.
<s> I told you, he had to go out on a case.
<s> Chapin did contact you then?
<s> At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
<s> --that was awhile ago--
<s> Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.
<s> Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
<s> It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
<s> My big civil rights buddy--  --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming.  What're you onto?
<s> It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
<s> I will not talk about the other two.
<s> Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and I put it in the office safe which was crammed.
<s> I'm not your source on that.
<s> Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
<s> --his dialing finger must be falling off--
<s> --I'm not here.
<s> You're a lawyer and you're here--
<s> A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
<s> Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
<s> Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
<s> Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
<s> --this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
<s> You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
<s> Larry Young, a California lawyer--
<s> My wife told me to expect you.  As you know, I haven't talked to the press.
<s> As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
<s> No, none of those.
<s> I'm not Miss Abbott.
<s> Sorry, coach.
<s> You need some work, buddy!
<s> Like what?
<s> ...okay...
<s> Pardon me?
<s> Single malt?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
<s> No idea.
<s> Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
<s> You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
<s> I'm glad you think so.
<s> Because I want to.
<s> How did you know I was here?
<s> You talked to Stifler?
<s> ...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
<s> Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
<s> No.  I'm missing the game for you.
<s> What's that?
<s> Sure.
<s> Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.
<s> Did you guys hook up or something?
<s> Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
<s> You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
<s> Pontificated.
<s> Right.  That gives us...
<s> You fuckin' rule!
<s> No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah, sure.
<s> Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
<s> I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
<s> It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
<s> Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
<s> Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
<s> A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
<s> Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
<s> I thought so.
<s> Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
<s> Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
<s> Strip?
<s> Nadia, I can't --
<s> Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
<s> You think so?
<s> Kevin, this is serious!
<s> I think "shithead" really says it.
<s> Just a second!
<s> So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
<s> Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
<s> You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
<s> I'm such a loser.
<s> Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
<s> He didn't?
<s> Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
<s> Stifler!!
<s> Dude, watch me work.  They go for sensitive studs like me.
<s> Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> Uhh! Would you die already!
<s> Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look...
<s> Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
<s> Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
<s> You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.
<s> Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
<s> Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
<s> Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
<s> A la votre.
<s> I know. He told me.
<s> It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
<s> Andy...
<s> Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
<s> You'll never get the chance.
<s> What?!
<s> I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew.
<s> Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
<s> I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
<s> Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
<s> Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
<s> I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
<s> Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
<s> You fucking liar!
<s> But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
<s> Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?
<s> Merde.
<s> Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
<s> Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
<s> You must have.
<s> Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
<s> What happened to your parents?
<s> I have my reasons.
<s> I was all out of dynamite!
<s> Trying... to... breathe...
<s> It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
<s> Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
<s> Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
<s> Don't be
<s> No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!
<s> No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
<s> You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
<s> How do you know?
<s> Shut up!
<s> That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
<s> Young	man, I...
<s> Promise me she'll have her home.
<s> And tell me that she's happy.
<s> Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
<s> that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
<s> You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
<s> No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
<s> Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
<s> I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
<s> Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
<s> That movie makes me feel guilty.
<s> Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.
<s> Hey, that was last year.
<s> Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
<s> I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?
<s> I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
<s> Oh, I'm in her acting class.
<s> No, Chippewa Falls.
<s> Yeah, my grammy.
<s> Well...
<s> Oh, yeah, yeah.
<s> Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
<s> That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
<s> What?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Okay. Yeah.
<s> Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
<s> H'm?
<s> That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Oh, yeah.
<s> Oh, yeah?
<s> Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
<s> Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
<s> Mine.
<s> It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
<s> M'm.
<s> Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
<s> You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
<s> Oh.
<s> No.
<s> Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
<s> Yeah?
<s> I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
<s> It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
<s> Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
<s> Oh-
<s> We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
<s> Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
<s> What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
<s> That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
<s> You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
<s> I thought just earplugs.
<s> Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
<s> Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
<s> I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
<s> My head is throbbing.
<s> You catch Dylan?
<s> You have a raccoon?
<s> Yeah, I love it there.
<s> Ah, Max, you, uh...
<s> We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
<s> Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
<s> Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
<s> You'll total the whole car.
<s> What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
<s> Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
<s> I just have time to get the, uh-
<s> No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours.
<s> I was very charming.
<s> You should talk to Mr. Joe.
<s> I'm not that good.
<s> She's got great tits.
<s> And you've only just met.
<s> Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
<s> What?
<s> It's an object lesson in grace.  Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once.
<s> What?
<s> You want a Tylenol, or something?
<s> Oh my God, the sitter.
<s> I love her too, Joe.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
<s> You really need to be fucked.
<s> Let's go upstairs, okay?
<s> Harry called.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Nice to meet you.
<s> Not as a rule.
<s> Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
<s> That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
<s> Did you tell Joe to behave?
<s> Did he promise?
<s> Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
<s> Skye!  I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.
<s> I'm going to throw up.
<s> It's taken care of.
<s> You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
<s> Otis!
<s> Love?
<s> Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
<s> Don't push me away.
<s> Don't do this.
<s> Ah...
<s> Oh, Sally Mae...
<s> I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
<s> Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
<s> Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
<s> And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
<s> In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
<s> What?
<s> Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
<s> I'll be your best friend.
<s> You're not serious.
<s> Yes.
<s> How long ago was it?
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh?
<s> Are you asking me to marry you?
<s> Oh great.
<s> Yes.  Fine.
<s> I never like to talk about my work.
<s> Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
<s> I don't mind...
<s> I hope they're watercolors!
<s> Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
<s> You weren't exactly horrified.
<s> No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
<s> Wanna dance?
<s> You -- you think I'm right?
<s> Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am.
<s> Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
<s> Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
<s> Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
<s> I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
<s> <u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.
<s> General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
<s> Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".
<s> A <u>few</u>?
<s> Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
<s> Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
<s> Duty calls!
<s> Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
<s> I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
<s> Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
<s> They should be...  But there's something funny about that soldier.
<s> Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
<s> Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
<s> You're a real buddy.
<s> What do I do?
<s> That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
<s> I'd love to hear them. Maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening, after work --
<s> Yeah.
<s> Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
<s> I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
<s> You shouldn't.
<s> I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
<s> I think so.
<s> He doesn't give a damn about me.
<s> Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
<s> Give what up?
<s> A bad insurance risk?
<s> Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
<s> Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
<s> As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
<s> I just want some fresh air.
<s> I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
<s> Where?
<s> No -- just come as you are.
<s> Oh.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Of course not.
<s> All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
<s> Mr. Dobisch said that?
<s> Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
<s> That's very flattering.
<s> What kind of joint are you running?
<s> Are you going to deny it?
<s> Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's not going to happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment --
<s> Relax, Baxter.
<s> Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
<s> You too, sir.
<s> The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
<s> Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
<s> Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
<s> Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
<s> How's that again?
<s> No I didn't.
<s> All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
<s> What do you want?
<s> It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
<s> Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
<s> Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
<s> Happy New Year.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  You fink!
<s> Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
<s> That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
<s> It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
<s> We didn't talk about it -- you did.
<s> Don't you ever stop talking?
<s> It's a thought.
<s> See if they'll what?
<s> Oh -- oh!
<s> Yeah --
<s> Well --
<s> Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that --
<s> Part.
<s> Yeah. Way north.
<s> At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
<s> Yeah -- you can really get hung up on them like the cat in the Delta.
<s> What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
<s> No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
<s> That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
<s> That we're dumber than we look.
<s> Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said.
<s> Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
<s> I'll go with him --
<s> We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
<s> In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light.
<s> Which way? Right or left?
<s> One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
<s> Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
<s> Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
<s> Okay, Willard, sit down.
<s> A lame ?
<s> When did you hear?
<s> He musta changed !  I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
<s> Hairy ?
<s> No -- no, sir.
<s> You know you're right.
<s> Yeah, I like it...
<s> Oh Captain, that is so true.
<s> I'm taking you back.
<s> His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
<s> No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
<s> What is this bridge?
<s> We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
<s> They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
<s> So they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
<s> 168  CONTINUED:
<s> Question is why they sat here when the storm moved in.  Check their stuff while I sniff around.
<s> He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
<s> Be careful -- there're two of them.
<s> Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
<s> Can't help myself.  Corbett's type always pisses me off.  Oh, I found this at the post office.  Had your name on it.
<s> Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
<s> Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
<s> New to the country, kid?
<s> Ecology.  Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.
<s> -- To take you to jail?  It'll be my pleasure.
<s> A daughter in Oregon.
<s> Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.
<s> -- Turn around.
<s> We've got another two hours of daylight.
<s> Forget it.  It would take days.
<s> You don't get it, do you?
<s> How many do you see?
<s> You don't feel cold?
<s> You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.
<s> Cowardly bastard.  I'm in handcuffs and I still scare the piss out of you.
<s> If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
<s> Don't try me.  I'll kill you if it comes to it.
<s> Good idea.  Flying over mountains can give you some nasty surprises.  Go too low, one of the clouds might have a big rock inside it.
<s> You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
<s> I'm right fuckin' here with you.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> I love you.
<s> Stay out of this...  Doctor?
<s> He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
<s> Okay.
<s> It's okay -- I'll sit here.
<s> My son is sick, okay?
<s> To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
<s> Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
<s> Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
<s> I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
<s> What do you mean? You said you liked it.
<s> ... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
<s> What a break...
<s> I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
<s> No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
<s> Good night.
<s> No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
<s> Stop staring. Do a vase.
<s> I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
<s> Sure -- take him to the vet.
<s> Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
<s> I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
<s> You little stinker. He's given you everything.
<s> Maybe this can wait.
<s> Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
<s> No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
<s> Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
<s> Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
<s> Look, we both want the dog -- and...
<s> I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
<s> Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
<s> I forgot to lock the door.
<s> Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
<s> Just a second -- he has to go.
<s> So you're from around here?
<s> No fucking way.
<s> What?  What's okay?
<s> That's right.
<s> You would be.
<s> I'm worried about you, Robert.
<s> He stole another contract.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.
<s> He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him.
<s> What do you want to know?
<s> This is crazy.  I can't trust you. You can't trust me.  How can we possibly help each other?
<s> Why?
<s> How did you get into the business?
<s> Why not?
<s> You went from high school to the Agency?
<s> Why?
<s> Why did you leave the Agency?
<s> Then you went freelance?
<s> Yes.
<s> Did it ever bother you?
<s> You said you didn't trust it.
<s> Several.
<s> Thinking.
<s> No.
<s> He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
<s> The beach?  It was nice.
<s> We split the money?
<s> You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
<s> He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
<s> No.
<s> What?
<s> I'm sure you will.
<s> Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
<s> Martin.
<s> Electra --
<s> I think you're supposed to answer that question.
<s> Everyone regrets something.
<s> Sure.
<s> It's possible.
<s> Average.
<s> I have all day.
<s> Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
<s> You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
<s> What's that? Free!
<s> What did the beer cost?
<s> This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
<s> No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
<s> I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
<s> Sure....As for the crap, I've got an idea.
<s> A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing?
<s> I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
<s> And suppose a little old lady lives there?
<s> Yeah, I'll take some.
<s> Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
<s> When your ready Son!
<s> Why don't we go together?
<s> No, not yet.
<s> That bad?
<s> Lucky break!
<s> No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
<s> Good, what's his number?
<s> 42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
<s> Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
<s> No!
<s> They didn't look like medical files to me.
<s> Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
<s> You used to read.
<s> I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
<s> Yep, it's all yours.
<s> Great. And your all set for the performance?
<s> Don't go making it too simple, we're on the cutting edge here.
<s> Great....How long will it go for?
<s> It's perfect, you've done a great job.
<s> What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
<s> Well she sure isn't normal.
<s> Am I invited?
<s> It's a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the States.
<s> Yeah seems okay.
<s> Sure!
<s> It's Josh's.
<s> No!
<s> I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.
<s> First, I want to walk free with a letter, in English, from the Prosecutor General dropping all charges. Second, I want two first class tickets to London leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope. Lastly, all actions against the students are to be stopped!
<s> Yeah!
<s> I insist, it is the least we can do.
<s> Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
<s> The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
<s> All the more reason to eliminate him.
<s> Heart be still.
<s> We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Landon --
<s> No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
<s> You do --
<s> No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
<s> Me.
<s> Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
<s> Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
<s> In 76 years, me neither.
<s> Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
<s> I'm really glad you think so.
<s> Yes. And?
<s> You're hardly nice to anyone.
<s> When I have something to say.
<s> It means you can do anything.
<s> I wanted this to be a date.
<s> We're doing something -- ?
<s> Twice a year.
<s> The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement.
<s> Sure.
<s> That what you do?
<s> I should have told you sooner --
<s> I don't want to come here anymore.
<s> That's what I mean.
<s> Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
<s> That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
<s> No.
<s> Either. Both.
<s> If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
<s> I helped Jamie with the first one.
<s> I'd do that --
<s> Please.
<s> Scalene?
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> No....
<s> Seventeen.
<s> Uh, hi....
<s> Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
<s> School? I never thought of school! If I went to school I could blend in with everybody else, couldn't I?
<s> But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
<s> Five cents, please.
<s> Now hold on a minute, Professor! Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this -- all of this here -- that this is -- it's a -- a --
<s> Precisely! 
<s> Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
<s> Ssshhhhh!
<s> Marty.
<s> Blast it -- no, I suppose you're right.... You do know the proper chemical formula?
<s> You were ringing the doorbell!
<s> Well, it was there.
<s> Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
<s> Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
<s> But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
<s> No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
<s> Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
<s> He said not to tell.
<s> Not bad.
<s> Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
<s> Yeah.
<s> He never bit me.
<s> You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
<s> Mmmmm.
<s> Tom...
<s> You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
<s> Holly.
<s> Sure.
<s> There you go.
<s> Great.
<s> Spanish.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Well, I got homework.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
<s> We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
<s> Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Anybody ever done that to you before?
<s> I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I hadn't... Never had any reason to.
<s> It was going too fast.
<s> How about over here?
<s> Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
<s> Yes.
<s> Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.
<s> Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
<s> Arachtoid.
<s> Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
<s> I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.
<s> Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
<s> Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?
<s> Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
<s> This is so embarrassing...
<s> Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
<s> My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
<s> I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
<s> Who?
<s> The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
<s> Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
<s> Yes I am. I'm working on a wres  please call me Barton.
<s> Really?...
<s> He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
<s> Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
<s> Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
<s> I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
<s> That's hamburger grease, Bill.
<s> ...Who?
<s> A week, eight, nine days 
<s> Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
<s> Well I...
<s> I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
<s> You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
<s> Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
<s> I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-
<s> Yeah, I'm fine, Garland  I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
<s> Okay... a quick one, sure...
<s> Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
<s> Hi, Charlie.
<s> Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
<s> Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
<s> Well, I guess you pick your poison.
<s> Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
<s> Charlie, I'm in trouble  something horrible's happened  I've gotta call the police...
<s> I've gotta call the police  or you could call for me 
<s> I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
<s> We gotta call the police 
<s> She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
<s> ...Both maybe?
<s> Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
<s> With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
<s> You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink  you're a goddamn write-off.
<s> Huh?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
<s> This man creates for a living! He puts food on your table and on mine! THANK him for it!  Thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or YOU'RE fired!
<s> Mr. Lipnik, please 
<s> Look at "Blood, Sweat, and Canvas". These are big movies, Fink. About big men, in tights  both physically and mentally. But especially physically. We don't put Wallace Beery in some fruity movie about suffering  I thought we were together on that.
<s> Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
<s> Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi.
<s> Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
<s> Did you find out about her parents?
<s> Yeah.
<s> My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
<s> Did you know Noah Goldstein?
<s> You saw all the reports, Beth!
<s> She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
<s> I don't smoke.
<s> I found some in my purse; would you like one?
<s> Yes it does, doesn't it?
<s> No.
<s> That's right.
<s> Thanks.
<s> No.
<s> There's Pepsi in the fridge.
<s> To see if he can get away with it.
<s> You mean did I write it before my parents died?
<s> To see if I can get away with it.
<s> I'll meet you there.
<s> I told you I had a vivid imagination.
<s> You paid $50,000 for your character?
<s> He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
<s> I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
<s> What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
<s> No thank you.
<s> I had sex with him for about a year and a half.  I liked having sex with him.
<s> No.
<s> Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
<s> Routine.
<s> Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
<s> They're executives.  They're nervous about everything.
<s> What are you doing here, Pop?
<s> Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta my head for years.  Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems.  One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as honey.  Said she didn't know why she done it.
<s> That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head.
<s> She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
<s> Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
<s> Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
<s> Is he dead?
<s> How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
<s> How you're saying she killed her parents?  Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
<s> You don't but it, do you?  She knew nobody would but it.  She knew I'd say she did it.  And she knew nobody would buy it.
<s> She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
<s> Fourteen.  We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  That's why you didn't find it in your computer.
<s> Not sure. How was yours?
<s> I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
<s> It's in New Jersey.
<s> Ignorant art?
<s> My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
<s> Yeah, I met her already.
<s> You want a drink?
<s> Sure.
<s> They're just words.
<s> You're not?
<s> Who said that?
<s> Should there be?
<s> See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
<s> Really?
<s> Use your fucking instinct.
<s> What's wrong with you today?
<s> Basquiat, what did you take?
<s> I don't believe it, Jean  they're picking straws.
<s> What's his name?
<s> You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
<s> That's great.
<s> No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
<s> Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
<s> I'll make you another one.
<s> That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
<s> I didn't know.
<s> Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
<s> You'll never guess.
<s> Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
<s> Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
<s> Better than you know, Bat-boy.
<s> I'm tempted.
<s> I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
<s> Yes and no...
<s> Had one.  Didn't work.
<s> Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
<s> 'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
<s> Y'mean take off our costumes?
<s> Weird, huh?
<s> Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
<s> Your blood, Max.
<s> Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
<s> He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
<s> Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
<s> You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
<s> I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
<s> She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
<s> The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
<s> That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
<s> No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
<s> Too good?
<s> That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
<s> What is it?
<s> That, sir, does not compute.
<s> Coming on line now, sir.
<s> It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
<s> Oxbridge Academy?
<s> Alfred's happy here.
<s> Divide and conquer.
<s> I'm afraid to ask.
<s> Can he save her?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> I wish I knew.
<s> She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
<s> Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
<s> Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
<s> Tell me and I'll kiss you.
<s> Well, I can respect your opinion.
<s> A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
<s> She has an excellent mind.
<s> Ninety-three, including the sauna.
<s> No. You said I. I killed them.
<s> Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
<s> As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
<s> Perhaps the fall...
<s> But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
<s> What's wrong?
<s> We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
<s> Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
<s> What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
<s> You understand obsession better than you let on.
<s> Why do I feel like the other man, here?
<s> Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
<s> Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
<s> What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
<s> What?
<s> Can't tell if you don't say please.
<s> Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
<s> What the hell is going on here?
<s> I got family. ...Please.
<s> You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
<s> A man with a death wish.
<s> Here. Get a good seat.
<s> Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!
<s> Upstairs. He's quite docile.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> I know. I called them.
<s> I won't let you have it.
<s> You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
<s> Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
<s> As far as I know.
<s> Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
<s> In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
<s> I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
<s> Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
<s> I feel naked without it.
<s> The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
<s> What now?
<s> I suggest a nice big bomb.
<s> Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
<s> JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
<s> That's it.
<s> Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.
<s> What?  I improved her a little...
<s> Some.  I am a rich bitch, remember?  I'm quoting.
<s> All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
<s> Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
<s> Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
<s> Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
<s> Allie, he's not.
<s> He's not crazy.
<s> Great. How??
<s> You okay?
<s> One.
<s> It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.
<s> Hi.....  Roses.
<s> It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
<s> Night.
<s> oh dear.
<s> Well, Ahm....
<s> Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
<s> Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.
<s> Great - keep him out of trouble.
<s> I don't think you really understand what you're looking at ...
<s> Yes, this is Doctor Bean.
<s> Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
<s> ... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
<s> Ahm....
<s> I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
<s> VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
<s> And a car.
<s> It's you and Mom that need to talk.
<s> Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
<s> Not my place, sir.  It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave.  Then where would we be?  By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo".  I'11 be back in 15.
<s> No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.
<s> Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
<s> Nope.
<s> Of course he is.
<s> The TV.
<s> Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
<s> Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
<s> Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
<s> My butt's bothering me!
<s> Huh huh. You mean like this?
<s> Uh, probably like, another five minutes or something.
<s> Uh...
<s> Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my life is like, flashing in front of my eyes!
<s> Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
<s> Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh.
<s> Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
<s> Heh heh, thanks.
<s> ...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
<s> Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
<s> That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
<s> Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
<s> Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
<s> So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
<s> Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
<s> Won't?  Or can't?
<s> That's my girl!
<s> Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
<s> She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
<s> Draw door?  I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
<s> Wait.
<s> Look, she's right.  We'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. I feel... confident.  C'mon.
<s> I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
<s> ... acts like she's thirty-five.
<s> Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
<s> ... we wouldn't have had our little accident.
<s> Is this like a trick question?
<s> I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>.  It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>I am</u> strange and unusual.
<s> Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
<s> For Juno, your caseworker.  Not that it matters to your type.  But there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you.  I'd say three hours.
<s> We're...
<s> Home.  <u>Home</u>.  <u>Home</u>!
<s> Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
<s> About what?
<s> Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
<s> Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
<s> They're dead.
<s> I want to get in.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You've <u>got</u> to say it!
<s> I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
<s> Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
<s> Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
<s> I cannot believe this.
<s> Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
<s> I say let's keep it the way it is.
<s> It wasn't a joke.
<s> I thought I saw something.
<s> Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
<s> Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
<s> Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
<s> I don't know.
<s> It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
<s> Why not?
<s> Their wedding clothes.
<s> But not for long...
<s> ... Straight out?
<s> No.
<s> Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
<s> How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
<s> In a day or two, yes.
<s> And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
<s> Yes, I have seen that show on television.
<s> No. I like this attic very much.
<s> It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
<s> Oh? Certainly...
<s> No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
<s> Yes.
<s> ... Mentor...?
<s> Our greenhouse.
<s> Yes, so do we.
<s> Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
<s> I see.
<s> Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
<s> That's very interesting, Eve.
<s> Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
<s> Yes, I understand.
<s> Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
<s> I see, Ben.
<s> Yes, Ben - he is.
<s> I understand.
<s> A flower...
<s> I want to tell Eve.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
<s> Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
<s> Is his back feeling better?
<s> You're welcome.
<s> I hope so.
<s> Which view?
<s> Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.
<s> ... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
<s> Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.
<s> Compensated...?
<s> Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
<s> Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
<s> As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
<s> Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you.  Is Eve around? I'd like to say hello.
<s> Try again.
<s> No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
<s> Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
<s> Would you two excuse me for a moment?
<s> Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
<s> Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
<s> Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
<s> Clearly, yes comrade.
<s> Right, Chief.
<s> Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
<s> A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
<s> I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
<s> Yeah.
<s> Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
<s> Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
<s> I'm a puppeteer.
<s> All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
<s> Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
<s> I'm scared.
<s> Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.
<s> Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?
<s> I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
<s> Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
<s> I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
<s> You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
<s> I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
<s> That... was... no... simulation.
<s> Glooph is not a letter, sir.
<s> Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
<s> Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
<s> I'll keep that in mind, sir.
<s> Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
<s> Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
<s> The usual, Barry.
<s> Dont let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
<s> Good. We'll sell tickets.
<s> I'll protect you, Dollface.
<s> Are you torturing me on purpose?
<s> A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
<s> No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
<s> I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
<s> Gehginnis ondah foam?
<s> Think, Jew florist?
<s> Do you?
<s> Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
<s> We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him...  ...for lack of a better word.
<s> It's Craig in there, I can tell.
<s> Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
<s> Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
<s> It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
<s> Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
<s> No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
<s> He's a selfish bastard.
<s> What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
<s> No. I'm looking for what I was put here to look for: the back door.
<s> Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
<s> YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
<s> WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
<s> That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
<s> No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
<s> I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
<s> Yes ma'am.
<s> Fine. But what would I do at night?
<s> In case of what?
<s> Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
<s> NO!...She wanted me to do it.
<s> Might see anything at all at 124.
<s> He's sleeping in the church.
<s> Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
<s> You know she married Baby Suggs' boy.
<s> Oh yeah. I got big plans.
<s> Paul D.
<s> She was my best thing.
<s> Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
<s> No sir, I don't, but I know Plank Road. 'Bout a mile up thataway.
<s> Yes sir..You right about that. That's just what I come over to talk to him about. Just that..
<s> Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
<s> It's the LeBaron.
<s> Why me, man?
<s> Shit.
<s> Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
<s> The?  Who the fff--
<s> Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
<s> Show me what you got.  Nihilist. Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.
<s> We have the urn.
<s> Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.
<s> Yeah, but we're--
<s> I am the Walrus.
<s> Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
<s> Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
<s> Well--
<s> Yes, uh, very impressive.
<s> Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
<s> ...Also, my rug was stolen.
<s> Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
<s> Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
<s> What's your drink, Dude?
<s> Regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude.  Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.
<s> But she hasn't run off, she's been--
<s> No it's fine, really, uh--
<s> Well--yeah, I guess--
<s> Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
<s> Maude?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Oh?
<s> But your father--he runs stuff, he--
<s> Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is that yoga?
<s> Huh?
<s> This is a league game.  This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?
<s> No, you're not wrong--
<s> Just, just take it easy, Walter.
<s> Well, just take 't easy, man.
<s> When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast.
<s> What if it's during a game?
<s> Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
<s> My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?
<s> It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--
<s> Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
<s> Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
<s> They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
<s> Not if I have anything to say about it.
<s> The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
<s> Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
<s> Dude?
<s> I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
<s> Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell happened?
<s> Then what's...
<s> Who is this?
<s> You are approaching a vooden britch. When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch you.
<s> You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
<s> Did I urinate on your rug?
<s> Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
<s> WHAT?!
<s> Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls!
<s> I came all the way down here same as you did.  Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see those jarheads beatin' on a good collar--  Habla Ingles, Tomas?
<s> They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
<s> I want to see the sun rise.
<s> I wouldn't worry about it.
<s> Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
<s> We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
<s> He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
<s> Not that I'm in contact with.
<s> Us?  What are you talking about?
<s> Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
<s> Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
<s> You should've killed her, then.
<s> Don't even start, old man.
<s> Watch me.
<s> Take him.
<s> You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
<s> Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
<s> He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
<s> Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
<s> There is no cure.
<s> Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
<s> You make it sound like I'm already dead.
<s> I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
<s> I know. Take some of my blood.
<s> It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
<s> I was afraid that might happen.
<s> There's only one alternative to the serum.
<s> I don't believe that.
<s> This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
<s> You're wrong, Dragonetti.
<s> Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
<s> Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
<s> My name is Abraham Whistler.  This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --
<s> I'll take my chances.
<s> Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
<s> I don't...I don't understand them myself.
<s> --bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
<s> A coward too. That's why she had to go.
<s> Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
<s> I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
<s> Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
<s> She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--
<s> --no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
<s> Whatever you want.
<s> --Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
<s> Yeah.
<s> You have to go.
<s> Sometimes.
<s> --yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
<s> --no, I think they're all in there.
<s> Turn the tapes back on.
<s> Who do you know who can? Where do we go?
<s> --go!
<s> --fuckin' A right--
<s> Yeah?
<s> What're you, nuts?
<s> --coming out of the water--
<s> Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
<s> No idea--goddamitt!
<s> <u>What</u>--
<s> --before you lose your emotional lunch.
<s> --I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
<s> --turn the camera off--
<s> Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today--
<s> Asleep--
<s> Spite.
<s> First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
<s> --oh, Jesus--
<s> No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.
<s> I thought the movie was bitchin'.
<s> Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.
<s> Why she kills children.
<s> And what's your excuse for being here?
<s> Then I have no idea.
<s> That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
<s> They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Domini.
<s> --or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods.
<s> You're needed here--keep watching--
<s> --it's urgent!
<s> Something happened with Marty and Ray--
<s> Yeah.
<s> ...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
<s> ...Mm-hmm.
<s> I don't know. It's early... I love you.
<s> I don't know. I better get off now.
<s> Thanks.
<s> I don't follow baseball.
<s> About ten years.
<s> I don't know. Motel... Abby--
<s> I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
<s> Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over.
<s> Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.
<s> What do you think?
<s> ...What kind of fish?
<s> So it would seem.
<s> Nah, I trust ya.
<s> For what?
<s> You shouldn't have taken the money...
<s> What's that?
<s> Tuesday.
<s> Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
<s> I'm not sick.
<s> Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
<s> Darling, where are the glasses?. Oh. here they are.
<s> Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
<s> Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
<s> It must be great.
<s> Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
<s> We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
<s> If you want to.
<s> No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
<s> Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
<s> Nobody.
<s> You said hello. to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. and something about a Meadow Lane. something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
<s> Well.
<s> No.
<s> It's okay. It's okay.
<s> See my nipples?
<s> You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
<s> No. What is happening?
<s> O.K.
<s> Yeah. hurry up though.
<s> I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
<s> No.
<s> Don?. Are you in with them?
<s> Kiss me.
<s> Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
<s> There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death.
<s> Oh God, Jeffrey. is that you? Oh God.
<s> Here's to Ben.
<s> There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
<s> No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts.
<s> I'm here, aren't I?
<s> There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
<s> Alright.
<s> Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
<s> First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
<s> That sounds good.
<s> Oh, okay. can I call?
<s> It's okay. Don't worry about it.
<s> That doesn't bother you, does it?
<s> I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.
<s> I will.  I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
<s> You want to go talk to him?
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> Jeffrey!!
<s> Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.
<s> ... You look beautiful.
<s> I like that idea. that's a real good idea.
<s> Hey Jeff.
<s> For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
<s> This is it.
<s> .Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
<s> I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.
<s> Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
<s> Yeah. okay.
<s> You can change it if you want to.
<s> Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
<s> You happy, baby?
<s> Derek!
<s> Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.
<s> No, I cam here out of my own volition.
<s> It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
<s> Diego needs to see you right away, please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.
<s> We want some grass.
<s> We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
<s> No.
<s> You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
<s> I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
<s> Just sell it, Derek.
<s> Yeah.  You do the talking.
<s> What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
<s> You fucked me, Diego.
<s> I talked to Foreal, Diego.
<s> Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
<s> Actually, it was three.
<s> Family.
<s> I didn't come here to drink scotch.
<s> I'm going to California.
<s> ...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft...
<s> Not mad.
<s> Figured what out?
<s> Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?
<s> Hello.
<s> I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
<s> Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
<s> Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
<s> Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.
<s> George, he wasn't asking.
<s> What's happening to us?
<s> Are we gonna split up?
<s> Dad.
<s> No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
<s> California.
<s> I'll be here.
<s> You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
<s> Swear on my life.
<s> Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
<s> Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
<s> Yes, I am.
<s> Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
<s> So, we need to get to the source.
<s> And you believe the NLF?
<s> You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
<s> I'll explain.
<s> C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
<s> No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
<s> Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ...
<s> It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
<s> Rue de Thbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
<s> Of course I am.
<s> So -- where do we start?
<s> Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.
<s> What good does that do -- it's the old will?
<s> Thanks, Mister D.
<s> What did he say about Miss Lawson?
<s> Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
<s> What'd he die of?
<s> Yes.
<s> She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
<s> I have.
<s> No.  I haven't done it in years.
<s> She left me.
<s> Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that...
<s> It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
<s> Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me.  She was just trying to get information out of me.
<s> Yes -- Insulin and others.
<s> We had dinner at a restaurant.
<s> And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
<s> No.
<s> Oriental medicine.
<s> Yes.
<s> What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
<s> Yes -- he did.
<s> He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
<s> What changed?
<s> Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
<s> Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
<s> You've tried it?  Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?
<s> Sorry.
<s> And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
<s> Not a very good one I'm afraid.
<s> We're not animals.
<s> Sure.  Where to?
<s> It's okay.
<s> No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
<s> I went out on the boat.
<s> You can see me now.
<s> To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
<s> I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
<s> I'm not leaving without that tape.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I love you too, Dad.
<s> -- But it's Sunday.
<s> "Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities."  Who told you to say that?
<s> Mr. Roston?
<s> I am relaxing.
<s> Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
<s> Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
<s> We have to talk.
<s> We can't pretend this isn't happening.
<s> Why didn't you come to me?
<s> You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
<s> We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
<s> I nearly died when we split the bill.
<s> Then we should have had lunch at the bank.
<s> Oh Jesus.
<s> No. You can have them.
<s> Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
<s> That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
<s> Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
<s> Yeah. But I thought she died.
<s> Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
<s> I never knew that.
<s> What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
<s> They got heat in Michigan.
<s> Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said -  "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious?  He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.
<s> Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
<s> No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
<s> No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
<s> I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
<s> Why?
<s> I think so.
<s> That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.
<s> Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
<s> You get used to it.
<s> You want to go back in?
<s> Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
<s> Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
<s> The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
<s> Oh, how is he?
<s> What?
<s> How about Italy?
<s> You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
<s> Because I already tried once.
<s> What?
<s> Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
<s> What makes it different, Robert?
<s> Then he can move! People move!
<s> What about us? What about me?
<s> Yeah. It could get better.
<s> I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
<s> Sure.
<s> I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
<s> I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
<s> Hmm?
<s> Nah.
<s> Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
<s> Look around, this place is a dump!  Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
<s> Just some flies.
<s> Go for it.
<s> I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
<s> Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.
<s> Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
<s> Damned if I know.
<s> Climb out to where?
<s> Or just Hell-adjacent...
<s> Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
<s> I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.
<s> No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.
<s> No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
<s> Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
<s> My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets.  There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  The city of the dead.
<s> Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
<s> Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
<s> It's alright.  If you want to go home...
<s> My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.
<s> Bill!  Bill?!
<s> I can't find you.
<s> What building?
<s> You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
<s> We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
<s> But --
<s> You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
<s> Get that car the hell away from here, now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
<s> "This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
<s> I am the future.  I am all colors.  All races.  All creeds.  I am the melting pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post racial.
<s> Then your father's a dead man and Jimmy Bones is gonna be around a long time.
<s> Evidence of what?
<s> I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
<s> Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
<s> You aim a gun at me?!  Do you know who I am?!  I am Gino Marzzone.  You understand?
<s> All part of the business.
<s> What the fuck is going on?
<s> Jesus, Caesar!
<s> Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
<s> But you know he did it.
<s> But it could be anywhere.
<s> Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
<s> You don't, you can't believe that ...
<s> Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
<s> Just hurry.
<s> Don't tell him --
<s> Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
<s> Oh, right.
<s> Go right ahead, sir.
<s> Sure.
<s> Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
<s> Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
<s> Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
<s> Truck.  Of course.
<s> Sure.
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
<s> What the fuck was it?
<s> What about that guy this morning?
<s> What choice?
<s> Does the case lock?
<s> Yeah, twice.
<s> Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
<s> He does it right in front of him.
<s> It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
<s> We're almost there, Violet.  just hang on.
<s> Hey.
<s> Violet?
<s> I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
<s> Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
<s> I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
<s> -- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
<s> We're in the shitter, man!  Pick your poison.  Maybe he's in there to finish the job.  Maybe he's working for Wombosi.  Maybe they want to go on TV together.  Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!
<s> You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
<s> Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
<s> <u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
<s> Look, maybe I should just...
<s> Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
<s> Yes.
<s> ...I understand...
<s> Who?  Who came?
<s> Really.
<s> Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
<s> You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
<s> I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
<s> There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
<s> Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
<s> ...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
<s> If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.
<s> This your store?
<s> -- here we go -- I found it --
<s> You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
<s> Enhance it.
<s> Zurich police are looking for an American with a red bag.  Apparently he put two cops in the hospital last night.
<s> <u>Where am I</u>?
<s> Uh - what? - I ...
<s> ...elephoned sir.
<s> ...aven't you?
<s> Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
<s> What? You mean you've got ...
<s> Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
<s> On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.
<s> Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
<s> SAM! What a surprise!
<s> Not really, no.
<s> You got the wrong man.
<s> What has Tuttle done?
<s> Yes. I'm impressed.
<s> There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.
<s> Well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over.
<s> What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
<s> Suit me?
<s> Cut it out, Sam.
<s> Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
<s> "Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
<s> Yes.
<s> C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
<s> What a BITCH!
<s> 27156789/074328/K.
<s> Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
<s> Yes.
<s> I won't be held responsible.
<s> {suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
<s> Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
<s> Um ...
<s> What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
<s> There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
<s> Er, yes ...
<s> What? Who is this?
<s> I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
<s> It's a 27B/6 of course.
<s> What is this?  Who the hell are you?
<s> My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
<s> It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
<s> What if there is no tomorrow?
<s> He flipped out.
<s> I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
<s> Got a beer?
<s> That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
<s> I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
<s> Ten-four, hon.  This is for you.
<s> What's his name?
<s> What did you say?
<s> No, I'd better not.
<s> I guess there's always a chance.
<s> At least he's got people around him.
<s> Our Lady of Misery.
<s> He's working a double shift.
<s> She should go home.
<s> Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
<s> I think it looks good.
<s> It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
<s> You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
<s> I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
<s> You asked me not to come.
<s> Because you can barely walk.
<s> There's no time.
<s> He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
<s> I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
<s> Thanks.
<s> She's no whore, Marcus.
<s> I need a drink, that's all.
<s> What's that, Frank?
<s> I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
<s> Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity.
<s> How many times have you shocked him tonight?
<s> What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
<s> A medical miracle.
<s> Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
<s> Let me think.
<s> He's crazy. He can't help it.
<s> Frank!
<s> I'm not hungry.
<s> Faster!
<s> You sure?
<s> No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
<s> Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
<s> We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind.  What are they?
<s> Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
<s> There are only ten.
<s> I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
<s> What's wrong with it?
<s> The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
<s> Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
<s> Why?
<s> Yes.
<s> A half hour in the lobby.
<s> Sure.
<s> This conversation is not worthy of you.
<s> Good night.
<s> You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
<s> We can cut back at the end.
<s> Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
<s> Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
<s> No.
<s> I lost six pounds...
<s> It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
<s> I'm not kidding.
<s> No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
<s> This isn't friendship.
<s> Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.
<s> Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
<s> I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
<s> Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
<s> Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
<s> No.
<s> Oh, that's nice...  We'll need some new lines.
<s> You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
<s> I'll never tell.
<s> Thanks a lot, Buddy.
<s> Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
<s> No.  I'm doing fine...Look.
<s> I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
<s> It's not.
<s> No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
<s> How are you at back rubs?
<s> Hey?
<s> Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
<s> I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Oh, good.
<s> Uh-uh.
<s> Great.
<s> Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.
<s> Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy.  You want me to talk to him?
<s> Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
<s> You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
<s> You want to come?
<s> Through the closet.
<s> I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
<s> Oh it's enough...
<s> What!
<s> Carla...
<s> Oh...
<s> What are you trying to say?
<s> Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
<s> Why not?!
<s> Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
<s> What?
<s> Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
<s> Is it?  I've forgotten.
<s> Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
<s> I know, man.
<s> Right.  Ain't no body of work complete without some... nudes -
<s> Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?
<s> No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
<s> Well I was uh, just looking...
<s> You want me to buy Dead Cat?  It'll scare people away.
<s> N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
<s> No...look I'm busy...
<s> Here here!
<s> That's really nice of you Mayolia.
<s> Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.
<s> Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
<s> If you see him.
<s> Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.
<s> My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
<s> No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.
<s> Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
<s> Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
<s> Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
<s> My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
<s> Down there.
<s> Don't tread on the earth?
<s> Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
<s> It's the news, Buffy.
<s> I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
<s> You were having a nightmare.
<s> Nothing.
<s> I thought we were meeting here.
<s> You weren't home.  Like always.
<s> Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
<s> Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
<s> I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
<s> For the dance.
<s> You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
<s> Pretty shallow of you.
<s> Get away from me!
<s> Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
<s> Where?
<s> Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
<s> I know.  I like your little outfit.
<s> Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
<s> To bring you... your birthright.
<s> You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
<s> To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
<s> Lothos.
<s> Cramps?
<s> It's true.
<s> Our purposes.
<s> We'll cover it later.
<s> We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
<s> Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
<s> But you enjoyed it, yes?
<s> Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
<s> Your turn.
<s> They were vampires?
<s> Five.
<s> Not if you're careful.
<s> But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
<s> Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
<s> Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
<s> You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
<s> Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
<s> Oh.
<s> Really?
<s> Nee sitch.  No way.
<s> I gotta bail.  You coming?
<s> Does Jeffrey know?
<s> Oh, please.
<s> Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.
<s> You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> I am.
<s> I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
<s> What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
<s> Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
<s> I'm really beat.  I need some serious "z's"--
<s> If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
<s> Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
<s> Get over here.
<s> I won't be needing these anymore.
<s> I got lured.
<s> Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
<s> Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
<s> Aren't we all?
<s> He won't make love to me anymore.
<s> I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
<s> Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
<s> Yeah...you a witch?
<s> What?
<s> Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
<s> We gonna fuck or what?
<s> You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
<s> You're a cocksucker!
<s> Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
<s> But he ain't seen my heat--
<s> Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche.
<s> Well, I held it like an egg.
<s> God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
<s> I won't have to.
<s> God--what a Big League move.
<s> The moment's over.  If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, I'm going downtown--
<s> Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...
<s> Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
<s> Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
<s> From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
<s> Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
<s> Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
<s> League record.  And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice--also league records--  Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.
<s> ...and one helluva guy.
<s> It's a damn convention.
<s> Jim looking for somebody.
<s> Where does he go?
<s> It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
<s> These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
<s> What do you propose?
<s> Wait, hold on a second.
<s> Speeding?
<s> Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing.  Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?
<s> Lester...
<s> I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
<s> Right away.
<s> Hey.
<s> Honey, come here.
<s> You mean, I have your permission?
<s> You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this?
<s> Why, somebody's complaining?
<s> That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
<s> All right.
<s> Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
<s> In so many words, yes.
<s> I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
<s> Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
<s> The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too.
<s> No, a...
<s> Why?
<s> It's me.
<s> Well...
<s> I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.
<s> I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
<s> They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
<s> Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
<s> What can I do?
<s> 'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
<s> She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
<s> No. Just stop everything.
<s> ...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
<s> I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy.
<s> No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
<s> Ginger's mission in life was money.
<s> She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah. Yeah.
<s> What do you need?
<s> Yeah, how do I know?
<s> Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
<s> What's it...
<s> And...
<s> With what?
<s> Fuck you!
<s> What if he won't stop?
<s> You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
<s> You get down here!
<s> You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
<s> Oh, you are...
<s> I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
<s> A record of the arrests...
<s> I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
<s> You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
<s> I understand.
<s> Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where you goin' -
<s> Okay.
<s> Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
<s> Now move along.
<s> Here we go!
<s> Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
<s> Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
<s> Is that the last one?
<s> Why, does it look like it's bothering me? What do I give a fuck?  Fuckin' Oscar too. All the fuckin' money I've given that prick, he don't even look over here. What's his problem?
<s> We're waiting on Carmine.
<s> Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 
<s> Stay out of the way!
<s> What?
<s> I know.
<s> I'll tell him, Remo.
<s> Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
<s> No. I ain't see anything like that.
<s> He's good. He's fine.
<s> Definitely the most important guy in this room.
<s> That's enough now!
<s> I'll be right out.
<s> But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
<s> Am I right?
<s> He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.
<s> Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's all right.
<s> 'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
<s> All right. Be careful.
<s> Okay, yeah.
<s> Come on! 
<s> You are.
<s> It means I got the money.
<s> Lester - he called you here.
<s> What a smart kid you are!  Okay, eat.
<s> 'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
<s> Get up.
<s> She asleep?
<s> Remo.
<s> But he never talked.
<s> Oh, he ain't nobody.
<s> Dominick said they're in the motel?
<s> Get out. Get out! Get out!
<s> Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
<s> No more! You see? Watch!
<s> Yeah.
<s> You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this.
<s> Then do it the way you want.
<s> Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you..
<s> I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
<s> Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
<s> There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
<s> Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
<s> What's the matter?  What are you saying?
<s> What did you say?  Selina, sit down, the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...
<s> We'll hunt him down together...
<s> I lied.
<s> It may be time to get the police involved...
<s> Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
<s> You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
<s> You can't get away with..
<s> I don't want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet.  After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.
<s> You're not strong. You're scared..scared that someone like me will see right through you. Whatever the Cult of Good was, it's not anymore... You don't have to listen to me, just listen to you..
<s> Men, huh?
<s> "Pre-bicentennial babe?"
<s> What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
<s> What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
<s> Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
<s> I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
<s> Don't you have children?
<s> This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
<s> I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
<s> I'm going to level with you officer.
<s> I want the gun emptied.  I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out.  That's all. <u>OUT</u>!
<s> Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
<s> It's taken care of.
<s> Make a "U" and go back.
<s> I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
<s> I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
<s> I realize you don't want to be involved.
<s> You won't disconnect.
<s> Because you know you'll be killing us.
<s> No -- nothing.
<s> One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
<s> Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick.
<s> Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
<s> Another minute.
<s> They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
<s> I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
<s> They say my work is somewhat derivative.
<s> Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
<s> I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
<s> That's not her.
<s> She's gone --
<s> The one in Brentwood.
<s> The City National on San Vincente.
<s> I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.
<s> Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
<s> Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
<s> I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
<s> Why can't it be her?
<s> They put their hands all over me.
<s> I don't hear him moving around anymore.
<s> I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
<s> Stop talking like that!
<s> Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
<s> Naturally.
<s> Only one way to find out.
<s> A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
<s> Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
<s> We don't see you.
<s> It's your call.
<s> Just relax.
<s> I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
<s> She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
<s> What are you planning to do when they got here?  They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel.
<s> I thought you'd know me by now.
<s> I suppose you're in your taxi?
<s> In your dreams.
<s> Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
<s> Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
<s> She's not a girl, Col --
<s> What do you think his name is?
<s> Hi, Jimmy.
<s> Did I?
<s> He wants to know do I mean that.
<s> It's a simple question.
<s> Bloody right I do...
<s> In a way.
<s> Guy I work with.
<s> Must be.
<s> Hi. You forgot your bag.
<s> Must be.
<s> Yes, please.
<s> Shouldn't I go?
<s> You say that like a gentleman.
<s> Like you're concerned.
<s> Didn't think I could.
<s> What is this?
<s> Dil --
<s> I have to talk to her, Col --
<s> Don't call me that.
<s> Shut up.
<s> You gonna tell me why?
<s> You following me?
<s> Yes.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> No. Sit down.
<s> Look on it like a honeymoon.
<s> I'm going home!
<s> My pills...
<s> Don't go like that.
<s> Did you hear me?
<s> He asked me to see were you all right.
<s> Got to be somewhere.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Never.
<s> The Metro.
<s> Carnations.
<s> Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
<s> Need to go across the water.
<s> Do you want some food?
<s> Yes.
<s> Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
<s> And anyway, he's seen our faces.
<s> Thanks.
<s> You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
<s> Would make me feel better about it.
<s> Should blow you away, you know that?
<s> I understand.
<s> Can't eat through a canvas bag.
<s> How is it a farce?
<s> They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
<s> And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
<s> Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
<s> Don't you think of it, fucker.
<s> The fastest.
<s> Tree.
<s> Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
<s> Doesn't matter where.
<s> My special friend.
<s> How can I?
<s> Who gives a fuck.
<s> He's a good soldier, Jude.
<s> It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
<s> You're going to look for him -- now?
<s> Why?
<s> I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
<s> Lord, you're stubborn.
<s> No thanks.
<s> Agent.
<s> What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
<s> His -- real -- ?
<s> Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
<s> Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
<s> Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
<s> But I don't have it.
<s> Agents.
<s> No.
<s> By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
<s> Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
<s> But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
<s> But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
<s> I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
<s> Very good.
<s> Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
<s> You'll wreck your raincoat.
<s> I said with the mouth shut.
<s> And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
<s> Reggie -- listen to me --
<s> You did.
<s> I think I love you, Alex --
<s> Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
<s> Maybe.
<s> In money.
<s> Here's ten.
<s> I'm very cold.
<s> I'm very confused.
<s> Is that all? Can I go now?
<s> And this? And this?
<s> A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
<s> You give up awfully easy, don't you?
<s> Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
<s> I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
<s> Charles sold it all -- at auction.
<s> I don't know where to go.
<s> Don't you understand French?
<s> Lay on, MacDuff.
<s> Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
<s> How about once more around the park?
<s> I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
<s> Yes?
<s> Please stop -- please!
<s> The American Embassy.
<s> Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
<s> He took care of Charlie for us.
<s> I think I know how to restore your reputation.
<s> So?
<s> You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
<s> What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.
<s> I want you to head right home after school.
<s> Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
<s> Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
<s> No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
<s> I can.
<s> I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant.
<s> 
<s> Daddy....
<s> Can you just follow me? The back is full?
<s> But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
<s> I was desperate. It was gross.
<s> You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
<s> Twenty eight years ago.
<s> Why?
<s> What?
<s> Yeah. I think it's really sick.
<s> My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
<s> So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
<s> Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
<s> This party is sick.
<s> What?
<s> He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
<s> The library. I'll be fine.
<s> Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
<s> Who was the fourth?
<s> Are you Jody?
<s> Just thinking about something.
<s> No.
<s> Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.

<s> Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
<s> Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
<s> What about all that "no need to get in the man's...
<s> Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
<s> That's bullshit.
<s> Ooh.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> ...about him.
<s> Oh, my God.
<s> ...such is the price...of patriotism.
<s> I ain't got time to argue with you today, Andy.  But I can tell you this.  Takin' your truck pissed you off?
<s> Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.
<s> If you're right, Lewis, this Mason is one hell of a pro.  He must have a service record and a paper trail some-...

<s> So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do what the Chinese do?'
<s> That's right.
<s> Probably.
<s> Who's the investigating officer?
<s> Would you call him a capable man?
<s> Honest?
<s> Are you sleeping with her? Come, come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
<s> My daughter.
<s> I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
<s> We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
<s> I've got her.
<s> What is it?
<s> No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
<s> That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
<s> Do you remember the figures we discussed?
<s> At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
<s> Either that or she'll be in jail.
<s> Could you drive me somewhere?
<s> How'd you get past the guards?
<s> Who?
<s> Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
<s> How did she...  ...happen to have them?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
<s> I guess not.
<s> Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
<s> Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
<s> Yes.
<s> I said I'll drop it.
<s> Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
<s> Oh... thank you.
<s> It wasn't much of a lie.
<s> But he wasn't killed.
<s> Did he know?
<s> No reason.
<s> No. I'm just a snoop.
<s> Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
<s> Oh.
<s> Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
<s> Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it.
<s> What were you doing there?
<s> I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
<s> Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
<s> I want to see her.
<s> What did you do that for?
<s> What the hell is this all about?
<s> What are you saying?
<s> She's my daughter.
<s> I'm all right.
<s> I think I got something.
<s> You'll find one of those people.
<s> And Mulwray isn't?
<s> Hope so. He's working for us.
<s> Only when I breathe.
<s> What about the water?
<s> Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
<s> That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
<s> They're all a bunch of phonies.
<s> Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
<s> I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
<s> She ran away?
<s> Then why don't you change jobs? 
<s> Progress! It always arrives too late!
<s> Whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little... 
<s> I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot...How is it possible for...
<s> Hi. Why are you running?
<s> Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
<s> Nor have I. Even though you disappeared...  But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  You still live in Rome?
<s> No...
<s> And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush...  Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
<s> The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.
<s> I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
<s> Go on!
<s> I didn't see that.
<s> I know.
<s> That's a long story.
<s> I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
<s> It didn't end very well, did it?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
<s> Hello, Bernstein.
<s> Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
<s> Because we're running a newspaper, Mr. Kane, not a scandal sheet.
<s> As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
<s> Yes, Mr. kane.
<s> He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
<s> I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note.  She was a little unwilling at first -  but she did it.
<s> The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
<s> There aren't any personal lives for people like us.  He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -
<s> Please don't talk any more, Charles.
<s> It may not be about anything at all.
<s> I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
<s> In the water.
<s> Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
<s> Oh, no, that's all gone.
<s> Half past eleven.
<s> Susan!
<s> Don't go, Susan.
<s> Don't you worry about me.  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -
<s> It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
<s> You can't.
<s> I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything I can think of.
<s> Can you prove it isn't?
<s> Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
<s> Why not?  Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
<s> - and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
<s> Charlie!
<s> I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
<s> Why, Brad?
<s> Hello, Charlie -  I didn't know we were speaking.
<s> What do you mean by that?
<s> Mr. Leland sent back that check.
<s> You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
<s> If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to -
<s> That's the train with all the lights.
<s> You won't be lonely, Charles...
<s> If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...
<s> He married you, didn't he?
<s> Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
<s> Am I sure?
<s> He smoked until the day he died. Used to put the cigarette in this thing and smoke it that way.
<s> Okay. I'm sorry about that.
<s> Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
<s> The ones in this town, yes! You encourage their growth, their habit. You're the source in this area, and we're going to shut you down for good! For good, cancer-merchant!
<s> Awww. That was so cute.
<s> And you said yes?
<s> Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
<s> No, you're not really getting married?
<s> Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
<s> Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
<s> If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
<s> You lie.
<s> Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
<s> Let me take you out tonight.
<s> What about Sing?
<s> He's your fianc.
<s> He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
<s> Um... okay.
<s> We did.
<s> So I'm told.
<s> Are you open?
<s> Annoying Customer.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Go open the sore.
<s> Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
<s> Why?
<s> Did you tell Veronica?
<s> I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
<s> Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
<s> Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
<s> Eight and a half?
<s> That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
<s> Your mother.
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
<s> What about Veronica?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Basically.
<s> This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.
<s> I told him that and he yelled at me.
<s> You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
<s> Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
<s> You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
<s> Let's hear it.
<s> I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
<s> No argument here. Insubordination rules.
<s> Exactly. They drank it all.
<s> One night only. She's buried in the morning.
<s> I'm going with you.
<s> Twenty-two; same as us.
<s> Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday?
<s> If you must.
<s> What?
<s> What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
<s> Five hundred dollars.
<s> Because I'm happy.
<s> No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
<s> She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
<s> I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
<s> Shut the fuck up!
<s> This life.
<s> I should shit or get off the pot.
<s> Oh, like your life's any better?
<s> Leave her out of this.
<s> ...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
<s> My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Jesus.
<s> What time did you get to work today?
<s> You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
<s> You need a ride?
<s> Same time. What about you?
<s> You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
<s> All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
<s> Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.
<s> Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
<s> One seventy-nine.
<s> No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
<s> I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
<s> Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
<s> Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
<s> I touched a nerve.
<s> How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
<s> To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
<s> Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.
<s> After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
<s> He gets off on it.
<s> I'm serious...
<s> Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
<s> That's because I never had sex with him!
<s> I love you. Don't feel sick.
<s> Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
<s> A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
<s> Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
<s> What?
<s> You said you were here all day?
<s> An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
<s> No way.
<s> No way!
<s> Because he's out of shape.
<s> Shit!  Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her.
<s> That's sick, Dante.
<s> I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
<s> Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
<s> Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
<s> Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
<s> You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
<s> Says who?
<s> So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
<s> Love's a killer, isn't it?
<s> Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
<s> If you want, do it.  I don't care.
<s> You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
<s> We spent a night there one night...
<s> Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
<s> You couldn't.
<s> It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
<s> He can handle it.
<s> I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
<s> Of course I do.
<s> I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
<s> Breathtaking.
<s> No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
<s> For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
<s> This rope is sixty years old!
<s> Hold on!  Hold on!  Reach up!
<s> Don't let me fall!
<s> Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
<s> There is.
<s> Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
<s> Kill him when he gets down.
<s> What about it?
<s> He can't be far away.  Find him. Go!
<s> Richard Travers.
<s> You're the boss.  Let's head out to the tarmac.  Matheson, have you been totally briefed?
<s> Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit? Georgie rises.
<s> Impossible... I don't believe it.
<s> I've been cured.
<s> Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
<s> Alex.
<s> To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.
<s> Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
<s> Tell me more, Georgie Boy.
<s> Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
<s> Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?
<s> Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
<s> One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
<s> Keeping fit then?
<s> Well, how are you then?
<s> Aye, that's Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That's what he is... he... he rents your room. Alex confronts Joe.
<s> Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
<s> Murder, sir.
<s> C of E, sir.
<s> Fair hair, sir.
<s> No, sir.
<s> No, sir.
<s> You mean like going to the pictures?
<s> I just say what the other person would say?
<s> Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.
<s> Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
<s> Yes.
<s> That!... Using Ludwig van like that! He did no harm to anyone. Beethoven just wrote music.
<s> But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
<s> Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
<s> Indeed.
<s> You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
<s> That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
<s> Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
<s> You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
<s> Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start.
<s> No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
<s> Four in this block, sir.
<s> You got a deal.
<s> Travel...and things.
<s> Just had one.
<s> Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
<s> He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
<s> Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
<s> I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
<s> It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
<s> Then let's have it.
<s> I think...
<s> Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
<s> ...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
<s> Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
<s> Pick me up in five minutes.
<s> And you came all the way down here to see me?
<s> Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
<s> What happens if you don't?
<s> Jesus, what is with this guy?
<s> Who is this?
<s> Max!  Dammit!  <u>Answer!</u>
<s> <u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
<s> ...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
<s> ...oh, bullshit!  He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
<s> You mean like benefits?
<s> You always stutter?
<s> No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.
<s> South Central.
<s> Play music.
<s> You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
<s> Yeah, like that...  But, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive.  Even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat.  Everybody dies.
<s> I'll deal with it.  I will, I will...
<s> I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
<s> I never learned jazz.
<s> I'm not catching a melody.
<s> You mind?  I'm working here.
<s> She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Why?
<s> You tell me to start a union, I'm blowing your head off.  Quit stalling and get out of the cab.
<s> Some living.
<s> What's at Union Station?
<s> That's what you said...
<s> Then what are you?
<s> What happened to you?
<s> Any special reason?
<s> Just drop me off.
<s> Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
<s> So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
<s> I think you're different.
<s> Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
<s> Them who?
<s> That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
<s> Surprise me.
<s> This would be it?
<s> 'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
<s> Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
<s> Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
<s> They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
<s> So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
<s> If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
<s> This way.
<s> I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.
<s> Top pocket...  Go on.
<s> Could you be a little more specific?
<s> It was my dog.  Let me ask you a question.  How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?
<s> You've asked me that one three times.
<s> Only on the football field.
<s> Fine.  What the hell is going on?
<s> You do recognize it then?
<s> I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
<s> Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
<s> Agent Lowry?
<s> -- Understood.
<s> I don't know.  Didn't see him.
<s> Your call.  Have a good night.
<s> Nothing.  I was just making sure. So, who are you?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> It's a hoax.  I knew it!
<s> So?
<s> If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
<s> Interesting analogy.  And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?
<s> ... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
<s> Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
<s> It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
<s> I'm not sure.  You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
<s> Put it on speakers.
<s> It's beautiful.
<s> It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.
<s> Is that your official response?
<s> But what do I say?
<s> Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
<s> Okay.
<s> Many others.
<s> The librarian... or the library...?
<s> But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
<s> But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
<s> Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
<s> I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.
<s> We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
<s> 'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
<s> How long was I gone?
<s> That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
<s> I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
<s> Yes.  Very much.
<s> Some of my best friends are scientists.
<s> If you came back.
<s> Something like that.
<s> It's late.  We should go back.
<s> I can't do this --
<s> I can't hear this now --
<s> It was quite a page turner.
<s> It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
<s> Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
<s> Cut that backsass!
<s> No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
<s> Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
<s> She's got him! You hear that?
<s> Pair'a nines.
<s> Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
<s> Well --- okay. It's a deal. One cold drink, if'n you please. In advance. One chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand... That goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.
<s> I didn't say nothin', Boss.
<s> A Lucas Jackson.
<s> I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
<s> Long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
<s> Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn't talk to them about that. But why not? They're reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.
<s> He's the champeen hog-gut of this camp. Hell, I seen him eat ten choc'lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes. He kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails, any damn thing. If you'd so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head, he'd even eat that.
<s> Come on, boy, come on, darlin'. You kin do her. Just let that ol' belly sag and enjoy itself. Stay loose, buddy. Eight more, between you and everlasting glory. Little ol' eggs, pigeon eggs, that's all, fish eggs practically.
<s> That is one mean lady. Bet her husband spends one day a week shooting milkmen.
<s> A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
<s> Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.
<s> You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
<s> None of your fucking business.
<s> Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison.
<s> I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.
<s> Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
<s> Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you really want her help.  I mean if you really do, leave them.  Let her see them.  I'll see they're safe...
<s> You said, first, he was lying.  How do you know that, Doctor?
<s> When was that?
<s> You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
<s> The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
<s> We know...  Send the book to evidence...
<s> Who was the man in the basement?
<s> I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
<s> I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
<s> I think this is number three...
<s> Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
<s> Nothing.
<s> It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
<s> Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?
<s> That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
<s> He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
<s> If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
<s> No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
<s> I'll get a locksmith.
<s> Is there a phone booth there?
<s> They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
<s> She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
<s> Yeah.  And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
<s> Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
<s> Who gives a fuck?  In all the years I never seen you cry.  You loved him.
<s> Classy madonna.
<s> What about her arms?
<s> Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
<s> I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.
<s> Shut up.
<s> I know.  Get out here.
<s> With the F.B.I. there's no such thing as a little help.  They bury you with help.  Explain to me about this virus, no don't tell me about the virus.  Thing is, you saw it, the pictures.
<s> I'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  I am dealing with it.
<s> Helen Hudson...
<s> I gotta have Ruben, and a...
<s> Give me Ruben back...
<s> Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
<s> Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
<s> I'll listen for you buzzing over.
<s> Outside in the visitors, car park.
<s> You should have gone to the funeral.
<s> Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
<s> I live in my car. This is my workshop.
<s> You could get your wish at any moment.
<s> It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
<s> I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
<s> I miss Beast a lot, too.
<s> All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
<s> You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
<s> Look, Mom, I think I've found the dress.
<s> Do you think I should?
<s> That's thanks to all your help.
<s> Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
<s> Can I get you a glass of champagne?
<s> And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
<s> It's good exercise, Mom.
<s> There's a spider in my room.
<s> That must be really difficult.
<s> Who do you think you are?
<s> You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
<s> Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
<s> So are you engaged, or what?
<s> Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
<s> Really?    Me too.
<s> But I do.     I love you, too.
<s> Open up.    I want to see.
<s> I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
<s> You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
<s> Coming.
<s> It wasn't exactly a lie.
<s> What do you want to do?
<s> Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
<s> Oh, ok.   Maybe.
<s> Sure. Of course.
<s> You can get out of the dinner.
<s> You just need to get more organized. L
<s> I heard about your friend.
<s> I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
<s> What does that mean?
<s> You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
<s> Where did they go?
<s> I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
<s> It's Elvis...
<s> You're there now?
<s> Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
<s> I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
<s> I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.
<s> He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
<s> I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
<s> You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.
<s> Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.
<s> We can't.
<s> We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
<s> I'm not any closer than you are.
<s> I'm just setting my boundaries.
<s> And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
<s> You want Zero to kill him?
<s> We'll think of something.
<s> I think he's already figured that out.
<s> I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.
<s> Do I?
<s> What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
<s> We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
<s> Good idea.
<s> You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
<s> I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
<s> No?
<s> Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
<s> What'd you get?
<s> We had a deal.
<s> Fine.     Ten o'clock.
<s> I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
<s> What'd they take?
<s> I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
<s> What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
<s> Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
<s> This is the only American car you've ever driven.
<s> 
<s> He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
<s> They sort of got away.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> How?
<s> We don't know that for sure.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Something like that.
<s> She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
<s> Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
<s> I do as I please.
<s> I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
<s> That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
<s> I'm just playing around.
<s> I heard you met Shu Lien today.
<s> You're too young to understand.
<s> So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
<s> Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
<s> Come and get it if you can.
<s> Not another lecture!  On guard!
<s> You coward!
<s> So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
<s> You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish.  Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away, far away, never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe, it will happen.  The elders say, "A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
<s> I will.
<s> It has.  How's business?
<s> I left the training early.
<s> That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
<s> I knew she would intrigue you.
<s> But Wudan does not accept women.
<s> To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
<s> My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
<s> Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
<s> Who ever made that.
<s> Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
<s> The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.
<s> I'm sorry as hell, man.
<s> Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
<s> This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
<s> Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
<s> You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
<s> No.
<s> I have to go.
<s> She's still dead.
<s> Murderer.
<s> Hey, I got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man.
<s> Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.
<s> T-Bird?
<s> Your pain ends now.
<s> Fine with me.
<s> I'm already alone.
<s> No.  I saw a guitar.  This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it?  There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  In blood.
<s> The night is young.
<s> That's right.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
<s> From who?
<s> I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
<s> Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
<s> You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
<s> Refreshing.
<s> It's my house.
<s> I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
<s> Don't you believe in love at first sight?
<s> How about tonight?
<s> Yes.
<s> Wait, don't hang up.
<s> Okay.
<s> "I actually feel good about myself?"
<s> You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
<s> Yes it does.
<s> I do not.
<s> I am lighten. Can we drop this?
<s> Not at all. Have a seat.
<s> I have feelings for you.
<s> Get off me.
<s> Sure.
<s> Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
<s> Greg McConnell.
<s> Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
<s> Don't think it's not going to cost you.
<s> Thanks.  Nice meeting you.
<s> No.
<s> Best friends.
<s> Well... not exactly.
<s> I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
<s> You think he'll like it?
<s> I want to go home.
<s> I want to go home.
<s> Some other time, Cecile.
<s> Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
<s> Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
<s> It works a little.
<s> Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
<s> I told you to lock the door.
<s> You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
<s> No.
<s> Ronald?
<s> It's Kathryn.
<s> It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
<s> And this happened before you and I hooked up?
<s> Racist piece of shit.
<s> He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
<s> What?
<s> Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
<s> Care to make a wager on that?
<s> Could you be more desperate to read it?
<s> You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
<s> Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
<s> Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
<s> Yippy.
<s> What's your problem?
<s> Where'd she go?
<s> Mock, mock, mock.
<s> I want to fuck.
<s> What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
<s> Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
<s> Excuse me.
<s> I've already told you, she's not home.
<s> Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
<s> Yes, you already did.
<s> Don't worry about it.
<s> That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
<s> I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself  tell the truth --
<s> Do you know the people?
<s> All right, mommy.
<s> I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
<s> What?
<s> That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
<s> Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
<s> This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
<s> This one hasn't got a name on it. Who's this one for, Amy?
<s> I'll just never learn arithmetic.
<s> It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
<s> But she's dead!
<s> Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
<s> Mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away.
<s> They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
<s> Will you come soon?
<s> Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
<s> Good.
<s> Don't you hear it?
<s> My daughter died long ago.
<s> I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise.
<s> Now, I don't know Amy --
<s> I like to see her happy.
<s> Yeah but they looked cool...
<s> I've been working out.
<s> Never felt better.
<s> Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
<s> Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
<s> No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
<s> Rule one: always wear make-up.
<s> Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
<s> Give him the tampon test.
<s> I still thought it was a purse.
<s> No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts.
<s> I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
<s> Frida, Carlton's dead.
<s> What? Why'd you do that?
<s> Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
<s> Starving.
<s> Knock what off?
<s> This really isn't a good time.
<s> Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
<s> Yeah?
<s> On your desk.
<s> On your desk.
<s> Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
<s> Intriguing?
<s> So what book did you buy?
<s> Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
<s> Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
<s> Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
<s> Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
<s> Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.
<s> Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
<s> I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
<s> Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
<s> Interesting possibility.
<s> They do? Oh no...
<s> What? Is there someone else?
<s> You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
<s> I don't think you'll hurt me.
<s> Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
<s> I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
<s> Worse than this?
<s> And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
<s> It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
<s> Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
<s> And you think I'm sick?
<s> Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
<s> This one walk you home too?
<s> One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
<s> Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
<s> Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
<s> Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
<s> Maybe ten minutes...  Thats strange.
<s> Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
<s> What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
<s> How could you have been so stupid?
<s> I didnt requisition a secretary.
<s> Fine.
<s> Why, yes.
<s> Then we must call the police.
<s> Shut up!
<s> You know something about me?
<s> Not exactly.  She was found in a canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut. Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
<s> Not that again...
<s> Uh -- I don't know.   Sometimes it's just like a barter thing...  Is this legal?
<s> Alan
<s> I was a senator, you know.
<s> We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
<s> Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
<s> I don't think so.
<s> I'm going to kill him.
<s> He was only doing his job.
<s> Bob...
<s> Just what you think I mean.
<s> ... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
<s> I was gonna do something with Joan.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> You could buy it on payments.
<s> It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
<s> He's not.
<s> All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.
<s> What?
<s> Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
<s> I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
<s> You1re leaving, too?
<s> It was inspirational.
<s> I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
<s> Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
<s> To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
<s> Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
<s> I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.
<s> Come on.
<s> Quiet!
<s> ...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
<s> You think you can find your boat? There's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a trail?
<s> He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
<s> We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
<s> We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.
<s> Ain't no place safe.
<s> God....damn you, Rhodes!
<s> Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...
<s> Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
<s> Sir!
<s> Come on.  It'll help you get Chris.
<s> Women swoon!
<s> I'll tell you later.
<s> And English, and trig
<s> So much the better.
<s> So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays.
<s> Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
<s> I told you, that's a secret.
<s> Doing fine, sir.
<s> No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
<s> It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
<s> No.
<s> Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.
<s> Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
<s> Sort of.
<s> Huh?
<s> Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
<s> It's just for a little while. You promised.
<s> "We went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life." Anybody want to read?
<s> I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
<s> His hands reach out and choke me All the time he mumbles slowly.  Truth... Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.
<s> You can't live a life for someone else, Neil.  You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me?  Have you shown him your passion about acting?
<s> I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
<s> I can't just forget her, Pitts.  And I certainly can't think about math!
<s> But she's in love with: the moron son of my father's best friend.  What would the dead poets say about that?
<s> Then you can help him.
<s> I'm sorry, Neil.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Found what?
<s> So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
<s> Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
<s> Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
<s> They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
<s> Yeah!  And just look at this ruler!
<s> He's the owner...
<s> We're going to die here! We're going to die!
<s> And where is our point of arrival?
<s> I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
<s> Did you clear this?
<s> Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
<s> How do you know that?
<s> Not like him.
<s> If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
<s> No...
<s> You ain't giving the orders here!
<s> You don't give a shit about anything do you?
<s> That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
<s> What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
<s> I'm stuck...
<s> I don't know...you got what we need?
<s> A little to the left...
<s> You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?
<s> A passenger...
<s> Nothing.
<s> What happened to Vivo?! What the hell happened to Vivo?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'll get it! Where is it?
<s> Jesus, it's freezing!
<s> It's Nick!
<s> Vince thinks... you know...
<s> Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!
<s> Jesus!
<s> You mean...?
<s> Worse since she talked to who?
<s> Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
<s> What hospital is he in? Where?
<s> Merle, hey Merle, you got any socks?
<s> Nick, we don't know where Sal is... Nick, Angela won't tell us.
<s> No?
<s> Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
<s> Will you marry me?
<s> Would you?
<s> Naw, it's... I mean...
<s> There's Vince!
<s> What are you, God?
<s> We what?
<s> I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
<s> Sit down.
<s> As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
<s> I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
<s> Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
<s> No.
<s> I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
<s> Here. Behind you.
<s> Phantom Mary?
<s> Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!
<s> Never one.
<s> One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
<s> The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
<s> I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find.
<s> Up.
<s> I can smell it.
<s> Wade's here.
<s> What did you say?
<s> He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
<s> No, you're not model material.  Anything else?
<s> Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
<s> I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
<s> Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
<s> We have to talk.
<s> He could be brought back.
<s> Keep 'em busy.
<s> But Sergeant...
<s> Technothugs.
<s> I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> What else did he get?
<s> Simulated one.
<s> Not too good.
<s> No you don't.
<s> My mom says I'm gonna grow.
<s> Good to know you, Willy.
<s> He lied to me again.
<s> I didn't.
<s> Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
<s> It hasn't opened yet?
<s> And what about Daniel Webster?
<s> Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
<s> It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
<s> No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.
<s> Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
<s> All right, darling.
<s> Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
<s> Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
<s> Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
<s> Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
<s> You are afraid!
<s> What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
<s> A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
<s> I'm through with you.
<s> Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
<s> Thanks, Mr. Webster!  To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster!
<s> Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
<s> Shall we?
<s> Morning, Jabez.
<s> Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me?
<s> How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
<s> You think that's a joke? I had him on there too, but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted.
<s> Coming.
<s> Not all of it?
<s> Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
<s> Isn't that your own fault?
<s> Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
<s> Consarn the consarn --
<s> That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
<s> Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
<s> Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
<s> It don't matter!
<s> Sure, Ma.
<s> Of course it's all right, son. You had Daniel Webster, didn't ye?  Breakfast's ready!  I've made a special surprise for Mr. Webster.
<s> Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
<s> You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
<s> Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
<s> Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.
<s> You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
<s> They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
<s> How about his job?
<s> I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
<s> Ellis, what have you told them?
<s> And if he alters it...?						*
<s> Then don't waste time talking to me.
<s> The only thing left for them is the City Grid...  ...They may not do it.
<s> Two?  Are you sure?
<s> I'm here, cowboy.
<s> Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
<s> You don't want to know.
<s> I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
<s> Roy?
<s> Yessir.
<s> This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
<s> Okay.
<s> They're not after you, they're after me.
<s> I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
<s> You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
<s> I'm sorry...
<s> Well...
<s> What trip?
<s> Where you gonna go?
<s> I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
<s> Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
<s> Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
<s> Do you still want the operation?
<s> I don't know what to say to ya!  I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever.
<s> What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.
<s> He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
<s> I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
<s> Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
<s> I got Sal.
<s> Call me Sonny-boy.
<s> Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
<s> So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do.
<s> I don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room.  I want you to see this.
<s> When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
<s> I don't know, Sonny.  I don't know if the helicopters can land in here. I'll have to check it out.  I got superiors, unnerstan?  They don't always see eye to eye with me. I'll do what I can.
<s> No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
<s> It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
<s> Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street?
<s> You're goin' outside with me.  If there's no cops around, we just split.  Otherwise, you go with us.
<s> It's locked on the inside.  It's through that passageway and to the right.
<s> Well, they go to guard school.
<s> You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
<s> I'll be God damned if you will.
<s> No.  I had some legal training, but...
<s> I'm glad it's okay.
<s> You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
<s> But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
<s> I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it.
<s> Dead or alive?
<s> Get over there!
<s> Okay.
<s> No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
<s> I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
<s> I want them all.
<s> The manager, he's diabetic, he's lookin' bad.
<s> I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
<s> Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
<s> What'll you do?  Come out.
<s> Oh.  Run.
<s> No!
<s> <i>Mr. Bishop... this is Claremont Williams. I own the Williams Brothers armored car service.</i>
<s> I've been training since I was twelve. Knives. Guns. Throwing stars. You name it... I can fight with it. I'm a hard worker and a fast learner.  Nothing scares me. I'm not afraid to die.
<s> <i>Morning.</i>
<s> <i>Are you all right?</i>
<s> <i>We gotta bring him in.</i>
<s> <i>I'm calling from the Kappa Epsilon Gamma house at California University.</i>
<s> <i>Remove... ... the... right arm.</i>
<s> <i>The money exchange will take place at Top of the World at the Stratosphere. Get there at exactly midnight.</i>
<s> Mr. Weiss was very generous in turning over some video tapes to the FBI. There's lots of footage of you. We know everything.  If you don't come clean... the information on these tapes could send you to prison for a very long time.
<s> Be kind to your sitter.
<s> Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?!
<s> Must you use that awful word?
<s> Hello?
<s> Son, with the exception of Spring Break in Tijuana, have you ever ventured outside of California?
<s> ...THEN SHUT THE FUCK UP!
<s> Nobody.
<s> <i>The tough get going.</i>
<s> Real fast.
<s> I be.  I'm living large.
<s> He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?
<s> Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.
<s> Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block?  Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
<s> I'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases.
<s> If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.
<s> Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
<s> No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
<s> Ask Sal.
<s> I'm cool.  I'm cool.
<s> You the man.
<s> A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time.
<s> Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.
<s> Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
<s> I'm in here.
<s> I'm coming.
<s> Yo, I'm gone.
<s> Sorry, comb got caught.
<s> I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
<s> Twenty "C" Duracells.
<s> Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
<s> That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
<s> Depends.
<s> Can't do.
<s> You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
<s> Where we goin'?
<s> OK.  OK.
<s> That's it?
<s> When?
<s> How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
<s> Where's the ice cream?  The Hagen- Dazs butter pecan?
<s> I can run out and get it.
<s> Trust me.
<s> Tina, it's not like that.
<s> Magic Johnson.
<s> That's right.
<s> I know.
<s> I like Mookie a lot.
<s> Here, take the broom.  The front needs sweeping.
<s> Since when do you know what's best for us?
<s> We don't know nuthin' else.
<s> Whaddup?
<s> Guys. Give me the two fifty and go away.
<s> ... flying gracefully... over the rice fields.
<s> A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
<s> Yeah...
<s> Yeah, but I'm buying.
<s> Very good. Back in a jiff.
<s> Okay, what?
<s> Of course, she's in on it too. Don't let her see you. Just go get that chest and show the world what Collins has been doing. I'm staying here.
<s> Famous? I've never heard of it.
<s> It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
<s> Is it okay if he spends the night?
<s> Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
<s> Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
<s> The principal.
<s> You brave soldier.
<s> And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
<s> LLOYD, she's my mom.
<s> You're not my real dad.
<s> Welcome to public school, my friend.
<s> Put some ice on it.
<s> You and me? Dream on, desperado.
<s> Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
<s> Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
<s> What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
<s> Yeah, that's why I asked.
<s> No. Look.
<s> That must be her boyfriend's car.
<s> You thinking what I'm thinking?
<s> Put a fork in me Harry, lets get started.
<s> PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than George Washington will ever be.
<s> That's the one I wanted.
<s> That's gross.
<s> Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
<s> No.
<s> Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Not to expect you tonight.
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> That's not your tape.
<s> Checking up on my friend, Harry.
<s> Oh, go on.
<s> This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.
<s> Looks like the best man won.
<s> Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
<s> I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
<s> You can bring whatever you want, little friend.
<s> Class, please study on your own. There seems to be a family emergency because there's no other reason why my father would interrupt me WHILE I'M WORKING!
<s> No, it actually fit quite nicely.  Well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide.
<s> Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.
<s> The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
<s> No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
<s> Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
<s> The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. -- The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...
<s> We felt his presence.
<s> It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes.
<s> That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice.
<s> Paul!!  Paul!!
<s> They said you were dead.  They said...
<s> I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline.
<s> Excellent!
<s> The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
<s> Long live the fighters!
<s> NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!
<s> SILENCE!
<s> The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. -- THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke!
<s> No.
<s> I predict we're lost.
<s> I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
<s> I think she's a honey.  Look at those jugs.
<s> Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character!  Bunny, Bela's here.  Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites!  <u>I need transvestites</u>!
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Ah, so I pull the strings!
<s> BULLSHIT!  I am ready now!  Roll the camera!!
<s> No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
<s> So why didn't you do it?
<s> This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
<s> Once you're in it, it warms up.
<s> Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
<s> Yes!  I've dreamed of it for years, but your movie made me realize I've got to take action.  GOODBYE, PENIS!
<s> Nothin'!  I told him he was great.
<s> I'm Criswell.  I know all.
<s> It's that easy?
<s> What?
<s> Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
<s> Oh, just like in the script!
<s> Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
<s> Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
<s> That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
<s> Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
<s> I told you this was gonna happen.
<s> I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug?
<s> But you used to say --
<s> Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
<s> What other sixty-thousand?
<s> No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
<s> Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
<s> Hruphh...?
<s> Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
<s> So you're not a fruit?
<s> Yeah.  I know what it's like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you... My girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out.
<s> Maybe it needs special handling.
<s> Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
<s> Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?
<s> Uh, atomic energy?
<s> Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
<s> <u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
<s> Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
<s> It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
<s> The <u>Ghoul's Wife</u>?!  God, I can't believe I'm doing this...
<s> Lines around the block.
<s> We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
<s> Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
<s> Mr. Wood!
<s> Honey, I have a little secret to share with you.
<s> No! Do they show you having sex?
<s> Al!!
<s> And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.
<s> You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
<s> You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
<s> This guy.
<s> What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
<s> Who?
<s> No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
<s> Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
<s> Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
<s> Mm.
<s> Oh my God!
<s> Yes to me or yes to the coil?
<s> Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
<s> But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
<s> Who's in it?
<s> Right.
<s> All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
<s> Really?
<s> That's lucky.
<s> Why?
<s> What?
<s> Shari...
<s> Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
<s> Come on, let's go.
<s> Come on...
<s> Are you all right?
<s> Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
<s> It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
<s> What did you do to your hair?
<s> Where were you?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Yeah?!
<s> What's the dif --
<s> Great.
<s> No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
<s> Yeah.
<s> Save it.
<s> I love you! 1 want to marry you!
<s> Do you still have it?
<s> Hi.
<s> That's the point -- this could change things.
<s> What?
<s> You have the key, Mr. McAllister.
<s> Okay.  Yeah.  We know
<s> I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
<s> See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register.
<s> Ethics are...
<s> I thought you were supposed to keep them.
<s> Good luck, Tracy.
<s> Hello, Tracy.
<s> Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
<s> Yes?
<s> Doing what?
<s> You'll be fine.
<s> I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
<s> Oh.
<s> No, I... uh, didn't know that
<s> Sherry... I love you.
<s> Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
<s> Okay, let's say
<s> Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.
<s> No way I It doesn't make sense.
<s> For what?
<s> Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --
<s> Good luck to you too, Paul.
<s> What's it to you?
<s> Yeah, plain scotch.
<s> Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
<s> I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective...
<s> It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
<s> A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end.
<s> I got her address.
<s> <u>Ear plugs</u>.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Dogs got no reason to live.
<s> Say what?
<s> I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
<s> His blood's always up.
<s> Anonymous.  Probably nothing.
<s> Okay.  I'll do it.
<s> I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
<s> That's right.
<s> You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
<s> What?
<s> I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.
<s> Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
<s> Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
<s> I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
<s> I know how he feels.
<s> Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
<s> I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
<s> The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
<s> Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
<s> Officer White?
<s> I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
<s> I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
<s> Yeah, it's subtle.
<s> Sid, how are they hanging?
<s> What's he doing here, Sid?
<s> And Reynolds?
<s> You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
<s> Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
<s> This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
<s> Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one.
<s> You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
<s> Listen--
<s> Turn on CNN.
<s> When can you get it here?
<s> I don't know who he is.
<s> One-twenty.
<s> How do you know so much?
<s> Why'd you leave?
<s> So what do we do now?
<s> What if--
<s> What if--
<s> How fast can you learn?
<s> Not particularly, no.
<s> Oh my God.
<s> I'm married.
<s> <u>What's</u> your point.
<s> Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
<s> A report?
<s> Listen to him.
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's okay.
<s> "Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--
<s> "At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks."
<s> Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
<s> Was that doctored-up, too?
<s> Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
<s> I don't believe it is, no.
<s> Not that much.
<s> He doesn't work that way.
<s> I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
<s> We're screwed.
<s> You have to.
<s> What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
<s> Shut the fuck up.
<s> Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
<s> Seat 74.
<s> Gimme a week and four guys from litigation and I'll have the Post pleading with us not to sue for libel.
<s> Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
<s> The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
<s> Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
<s> Did they take your clothes?
<s> You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
<s> Jesus.
<s> Bobby--
<s> I honestly don't know.
<s> What the hell does it mean?
<s> You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
<s> We found the originals.
<s> You're kidding me.
<s> Dean's with Lyle.
<s> He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.
<s> The door was open, sir. I just need a signature.
<s> I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
<s> No.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
<s> Excuse me.
<s> As the wife of one of our party.
<s> What do you mean, poetry?
<s> He said - be careful.
<s> And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would.
<s> Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
<s> No.
<s> That makes it harder still.
<s> A lie.  What do you hate most?
<s> Don't go over it again, please.
<s> Don't do this.
<s> You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
<s> I know, darling, I'm sorry.
<s> Of course.  You idiot.  I always wear it. I've always worn it.  I've always loved you.
<s> I'm just going to find things for the fire.
<s> Yes.  Absolutely.
<s> There you have me.
<s> Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.
<s> Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
<s> I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
<s> Sorry, what's your point?
<s> Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
<s> I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
<s> Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
<s> Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
<s> Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy.  And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura.
<s> What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
<s> Right.
<s> Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
<s> You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
<s> I don't know what that means.
<s> Please don't creep around this house.
<s> I liberated it.
<s> There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
<s> And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
<s> Thousands of people did die, just different people.
<s> Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft
<s> Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
<s> I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
<s> Are you crazy?
<s> Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
<s> Your friend?
<s> Well then - yes.  Of course.
<s> Sikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.
<s> Really?  That's sudden.
<s> I'm not sewing anything else.
<s> It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
<s> He can't even move.
<s> No.  He's - no.
<s> Does he have to go?
<s> I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
<s> Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
<s> I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
<s> No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almsy, who doesn't look up from his book.
<s> - The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
<s> Put the bolts on that window under a scope, I'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them.
<s> How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
<s> I don't know, but close.
<s> You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
<s> I'm going to get him, I promise you.
<s> Who am I?
<s> It's sold.
<s> You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
<s> Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
<s> It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
<s> It's not for sale.
<s> It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
<s> Give him the card.
<s> I'm a thief. Sue me.
<s> A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
<s> No. It's a down payment.
<s> It was a long time ago.
<s> Yes you did.
<s> A dozen times.
<s> So you had to be your own lifeline.
<s> You're not on the beat.
<s> You don't know the half of it.
<s> Okay, 80-20--
<s> Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
<s> Right. The eight billion.
<s> And the money goes--
<s> Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
<s> There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
<s> Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
<s> Let me guess. His retinal plate is in there.
<s> Packed.
<s> Seen one billion, seen them all.
<s> That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me.
<s> Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.
<s> Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
<s> This is big enough.
<s> Because I never assume anything.
<s> I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
<s> You damn well thought wrong.
<s> Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
<s> I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
<s> Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
<s> What do you think?  What's this?
<s> Which one?
<s> An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
<s> She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
<s> Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
<s> Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.
<s> ... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
<s> I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.
<s> Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that.
<s> Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus.
<s> Course I did.
<s> That wasn't an offer.  A million would've been an offer.  When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
<s> It's not about working hard --
<s> I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
<s> Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
<s> Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I work on this thing, the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is.  Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and <u>we're</u> the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things?  That's just not right.
<s> Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
<s> I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
<s> Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
<s> And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
<s> Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
<s> It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case.  Their lawyers go --
<s> Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
<s> This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
<s> Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too.
<s> You see your office?
<s> Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...
<s> Yesterday.
<s> At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
<s> Nope.  Maiden.
<s> Ross -- you are an absolute angel.
<s> Have you been to the water board?
<s> Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
<s> We'll see.
<s> You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
<s> Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
<s> You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
<s> Ten?
<s> I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
<s> Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
<s> No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them.  But you know what?  They're wrong.
<s> Keep your voice down.
<s> Lock the door.
<s> I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.
<s> I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
<s> Real early.  We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.
<s> Uh-huh?
<s> Yes?
<s> Barks an argument and shakes his head.
<s> Barks and growls at his boss.
<s> Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
<s> Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
<s> You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
<s> The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
<s> I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
<s> Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
<s> Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
<s> I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
<s> An Imperial probe droid.
<s> Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
<s> Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
<s> Why?
<s> You look great.
<s> Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.
<s> Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
<s> Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
<s> Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?
<s> I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.
<s> Thanks.
<s> You're part of the mining guild then?
<s> Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
<s> I didn't say anything?
<s> What is it?
<s> No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
<s> No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.
<s> The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
<s> Free your mind and return he will.
<s> Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.
<s> I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
<s> I'll die first.
<s> Time will tell.
<s> Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
<s> Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
<s> I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People.
<s> It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.
<s> Go on now. Do as I say.
<s> What?
<s> Don't lie to me.
<s> My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
<s> Having second thoughts?
<s> There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
<s> Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
<s> You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
<s> You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.
<s> Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President's daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings.
<s> Right over there.
<s> Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.
<s> If he lets you get close enough.
<s> Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.
<s> Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
<s> The what?
<s> Sewers. Come on.
<s> What the hell is this?
<s> I'm looking for somebody.
<s> --By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered!
<s> I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.
<s> But one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the King's law.
<s> Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule.
<s> I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
<s> Speak of the devil!...
<s> I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
<s> What's this, what's this?!
<s> Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
<s> Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
<s> Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
<s> I don't know. Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own. At first, I did so because I feared Merlin, later because I loved you.
<s> I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers.
<s> No.
<s> There is one.
<s> You.
<s> Yes. I would swear my love to you.
<s> We are to blame.
<s> You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
<s> I will run.
<s> Can it truly be used for magic?
<s> Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
<s> That I cannot.
<s> One land, one king! That is my peace!
<s> Doing what I did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. It takes it's toll. It took nine moons to get back my strength.
<s> You strike me with words as hard as steel.
<s> What's he doing there? Teaching?
<s> I didn't know that.
<s> I see, your excellency.
<s> Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
<s> What's this?
<s> Maybe the circuit is busy?
<s> I can't believe it.
<s> No, she was heavily sedated.
<s> Yes, I'm affraid it is.
<s> Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
<s> Yes, I go now.
<s> Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
<s> What is it? A tranquilizer?
<s> Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
<s> Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
<s> The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.
<s> The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
<s> It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
<s> No.
<s> Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.
<s> Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
<s> Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
<s> Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
<s> No.
<s> Please.
<s> In Europe.
<s> No
<s> You like it?
<s> Captain Howdy.
<s> You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
<s> You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
<s> Your not gonna marry him are you?
<s> How do you know?
<s> Okay.
<s> Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!
<s> St. Mike's.
<s> Damien Karras.
<s> I came to say goodbye.
<s> Sure.
<s> That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
<s> If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?
<s> Intensely.
<s> Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
<s> How's your leg?
<s> Oh really, when?
<s> Okay
<s> I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
<s> And let my cry come unto thee.
<s> Defender of the human race...
<s> From the psychiatric end.
<s> Is that a threat?
<s> Very much.
<s> Come on!
<s> Shove it up your ass you faggot!
<s> Yes.
<s> Sometimes.
<s> No.
<s> Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
<s> It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
<s> Suit yourself.
<s> Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
<s> No bones?
<s> I thought maybe held gotten over that.
<s> Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association.
<s> Frank.
<s> Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
<s> Try the black Knable.
<s> It's more than that.
<s> You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
<s> It's not family.  It's business.
<s> Yeah, okay.
<s> What?
<s> Terrific.
<s> I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
<s> It wasn't like that.
<s> Talk.
<s> If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
<s> You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
<s> I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
<s> I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
<s> And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.
<s> That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.
<s> Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.
<s> Thanks, but I've got plans.
<s> No, you take the right.
<s> Good idea.
<s> Right.
<s> No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
<s> Christ, can't you hear it?
<s> Because I can hear it.
<s> Huh?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
<s> February?
<s> You always threw up.
<s> You could've come.
<s> The tenth's out.
<s> Shut up, Frank.
<s> Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
<s> It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
<s> Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
<s> Blanche.
<s> Well, that's fine --
<s> Impersonally.
<s> You're an hour and a half late.
<s> Miss --
<s> Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.
<s> And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
<s> What's he talking about?
<s> Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
<s> We're not exactly silly with time, you know.  Jack, you find anything?
<s> Uh... good.
<s> They're nines.
<s> Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
<s> I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it.
<s> People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
<s> They must've bought the same map we did.
<s> Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
<s> Uh ... thanks.
<s> Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
<s> Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  Shit.
<s> The Stratford.
<s> Huh?
<s> I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
<s> Who's Nina?
<s> Coffee?
<s> We outgrew each other.
<s> You don't pick your brother.
<s> No.
<s> Sounds big.  What's he do?
<s> Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
<s> I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
<s> He's losing his teeth.
<s> Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
<s> What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
<s> My place.
<s> Should be.  It's yours.
<s> Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
<s> So?  The procnias averano is a South American bird.  The flight here was only three hours!  And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?
<s> Were you there to catch me?
<s> One last time.  It's important ...
<s> He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
<s> Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
<s> I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
<s> What?
<s> No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
<s> Yeah -- it's Santa's Magic fucking Village.  Your present's in here.
<s> Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
<s> No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
<s> So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
<s> The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> A broker? Really. And now youre in the tire business?
<s> Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
<s> Im not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
<s> But I think I like you better this way...
<s> Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
<s> Im not worried, Mom. Hes still learning our ways...
<s> Who did?
<s> Thats good but...you did forget the anniversary.
<s> Its me, Jack...
<s> We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.
<s> Yes, thats it...yes, we went to high school together.
<s> Brought what on myself?! I didnt do anything!
<s> I asked you a direct question!  A glimpse of what?!
<s> Do I look like I live in a bottle?
<s> Maybe youre not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President...
<s> Uh huh...
<s> If youre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
<s> You mean dont go at all? What about my internship?
<s> What?
<s> No, youre right.  What are we doing?
<s> Because thats where I live.
<s> Telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids.
<s> Because youll be here.
<s> Its an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  Im gonna buy it...
<s> Do you have any idea what my life is like?
<s> I cant believe its not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I couldve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
<s> No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didnt we?
<s> If you want to look at it that way...
<s> Thats my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
<s> Oh yeah, youre a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...Im gonna take you to that special place...
<s> Zeena...
<s> Enjoy it, sweetheart...
<s> Whats the difference? Im taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
<s> Are you sure?
<s> I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
<s> A perk for what?
<s> Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and Im going to be heading it up.
<s> Jesus, Jack...
<s> Hello Jack.  You dont have to stop singing on my account...
<s> You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
<s> Im sorry, no...
<s> You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
<s> My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you'd walk by.
<s> Five times.
<s> This makes five.
<s> Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
<s> Yeah, nine years straight.
<s> They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
<s> Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company.
<s> To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.
<s> I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
<s> I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --
<s> Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
<s> At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
<s> No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
<s> History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
<s> Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
<s> Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
<s> Reed, we're running out of time.
<s> Ben did this.
<s> Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
<s> I was talking about us.  Working together.
<s> Great minds think alike.
<s> You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
<s> What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
<s> That's what we're here to find out.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> What in the world would give me that idea?
<s> I think it was a little more complicated than --
<s> No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
<s> I gave him twenty.
<s> Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
<s> I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
<s> Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.
<s> Susan.  What are you doing?
<s> I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love.  To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
<s> That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
<s> In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.
<s> Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
<s> We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
<s> Attack? Who -- or should I say what from?
<s> Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
<s> I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
<s> Now I know...
<s> Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
<s> Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
<s> As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
<s> Maybe we can...  Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub?
<s> If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
<s> It I can clear this Central Nerve, that <may> be enough...
<s> What about Dr. Michaels?
<s> At an operation?
<s> Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
<s> Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
<s> They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
<s> Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
<s> Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!
<s> Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
<s> We're losing pressure in the Flotation Tanks. Check the Manual, right over there.
<s> Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?
<s> Then don't drift down further.
<s> We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
<s> I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
<s> Certainly.
<s> Whoa, Daddy.
<s> We split that.
<s> The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
<s> You want your own wife kidnapped?
<s> Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
<s> You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it?
<s> End a April.
<s> You have children?
<s> Oh, now he's adorable.
<s> Mr. Mohra?
<s> White Bear Lake?
<s> Oh, yah?
<s> Yah?
<s> Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
<s> Huh? Yah?
<s> I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
<s> Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
<s> Ma'am, I answered your question.
<s> Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
<s> Know who this is?
<s> We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
<s> Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
<s> Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
<s> Yah.
<s> No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
<s> Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
<s> No! No cops! That's final! This is my deal here, Wade! Jean is my wife here!
<s> Ah, dammit!
<s> Look, Jerry, you're not sellin' me a damn car. It's my show here.  That's that.
<s> Well, I don't vouch for him.
<s> Yah.
<s> You had breakfast yet, Margie?
<s> You don't think he's mixed up in -
<s> Well, how the heck are ya?
<s> Well, yah, I was married. I was married to - You mind if I sit over here?
<s> No, no, that's fine.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...
<s> Anyone else residing there?
<s> Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Yah, is this Marge?
<s> Norm?
<s> No.
<s> - looking.
<s> Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.
<s> Yah, ya think?
<s> Yah.
<s> She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
<s> I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
<s> Yeah, both of us.
<s> It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
<s> Have you finished those reports?
<s> Does this sound strange to you?
<s> Sure.
<s> Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
<s> You can't have the whole brain!
<s> Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three.
<s> Should we?
<s> I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
<s> Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
<s> This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
<s> So you're staying in tonight?
<s> Here.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Chloe's dead.
<s> Do you care?
<s> Hear what?
<s> We did make love?
<s> What... ?
<s> I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me.
<s> What?
<s> You are an insane person.
<s> Who do you think I am?
<s> Tyler Durden.
<s> No, supply oxygen?
<s> There's always that.
<s> The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
<s> Do what you like.
<s> So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
<s> We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
<s> I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
<s> In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution...
<s> This is crazy.
<s> A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.
<s> Hum.
<s> No.  Not at all.
<s> Uh... nah...
<s> Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.
<s> You quit?
<s> Nothing.  Do what you like.
<s> Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
<s> You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
<s> You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
<s> If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
<s> What about Marla?
<s> What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
<s> We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
<s> You and your friend.
<s> Please, God, no...
<s> Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
<s> Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
<s> You were there?
<s> Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
<s> How you doing in there, hero?
<s> No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
<s> Holy shit.  He said "only new life can defeat death."  If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a brand new soul that was never part of Death's Design...
<s> We need to hurry.
<s> Carter.
<s> Blow me.
<s> Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
<s> Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
<s> There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
<s> The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.
<s> Clean up?  I don't...
<s> Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
<s> I know how it feels to be dead.
<s> Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
<s> You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
<s> Yeah, but everything's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming.  Almost like bein' able... to see the future.
<s> I'm... really sorry.
<s> What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
<s> As in flannels and plaids?
<s> That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
<s> No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
<s> Most kids never have it happen.
<s> No! No! Don't!
<s> You're the fuckin' devil.
<s> Oh, you've noticed it, too?
<s> Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
<s> They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
<s> That's what I'm doin'!
<s> AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.
<s> Where's your stuff?
<s> That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
<s> Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
<s> Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
<s> Powerful warrior.
<s> Guard barracks.  Take some shots.
<s> Let me see.
<s> I suppose you have...
<s> You comin'?
<s> It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
<s> I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.
<s> Spooks?
<s> You think you are... .
<s> Sorry, Sir.
<s> What's the plan?
<s> I was crossed-trained in gunships.
<s> What?
<s> About 22 hours on site.
<s> This mission was a scam from the word go?
<s> That's a crock.  We don't say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public?  The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom.  Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back.  That's billion, Colonel.  With a "B".  For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  A pain in the ass to everybody?  No way. There's no way.
<s> Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.
<s> American.  Come to get you out.
<s> De Fravio.  Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant... Air Force.
<s> I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.
<s> Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
<s> Well, there's nobody special!
<s> This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
<s> <u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!
<s> Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
<s> I was attacked.
<s> I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
<s> The moron?
<s> He just needs some clothes?
<s> Thank you very much.
<s> First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
<s> I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
<s> NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
<s> NO! I want a debutante on a horse to step on me.  Leave me alone!!
<s> I... I was just leaving.
<s> Fine.  I'll say no.
<s> Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
<s> No, I have to work.
<s> Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
<s> Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
<s> Yes.  They're free.
<s> How much?
<s> Tonight!  How's tonight?
<s> I'm not...  Now, where are those shoes...
<s> No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
<s> I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
<s> Fifty dollars?
<s> Well what am I gonna do with it?
<s> Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
<s> So what? You going to help me?
<s> It's a classic.
<s> Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
<s> Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
<s> No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
<s> It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
<s> BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!
<s> You advise us!
<s> You won't be alone for long.
<s> I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
<s> You have a disease.
<s> A wig?
<s> Well, lemme play the other side then.
<s> Out where?
<s> I'm not some piece a crap.
<s> You treat me like I was.
<s> I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
<s> It brings out my eyes...
<s> I don't, huh?
<s> Fill it up.
<s> Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
<s> Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
<s> I know.
<s> No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
<s> Uhm hmm. Some range.
<s> Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
<s> What?
<s> Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
<s> What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
<s> Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
<s> At being a fake.
<s> I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
<s> I'll be back later...
<s> Catherine...
<s> Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
<s> What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
<s> I think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, Samia...
<s> Then don't go out with me.
<s> I'm wit' Carlos.
<s> Nah, we make out and stuff.
<s> You look good.
<s> Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.
<s> Eddie from Compost?
<s> Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-
<s> Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
<s> How old is he?
<s> Positive.
<s> Wha'?
<s> You're kidding.
<s> Sonofabitch.
<s> I ought to get some sleep.
<s> Not luck. They don't want me.
<s> One. B-a-b-a-r.
<s> Funny old bird.
<s> I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
<s> You don't know me.
<s> Affirmative.
<s> Where am I?
<s> Wait a second --
<s> Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
<s> Well, I'm fully covered.
<s> Come on in.
<s> And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> No problem.
<s> Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
<s> Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
<s> Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
<s> Not me.
<s> That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while.
<s> How long have they been married?
<s> No, thank you.
<s> Depends on the question.
<s> Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
<s> What is this?
<s> I think you should call me Gail, now.
<s> Why did you do it?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
<s> But I've seen the deed.
<s> Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
<s> If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?
<s> Bastard.
<s> They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
<s> Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
<s> Cabana one.
<s> Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
<s> Very good, sir.
<s> Uh, almost.
<s> Well, there we're in a gray area.
<s> I'd say charcoal.
<s> Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God.  I hope.
<s> Not really?
<s> John!
<s> In a minute!
<s> Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
<s> I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
<s> What did these Vancouver factories do?
<s> I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...
<s> I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
<s> You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
<s> Make eye contact when you say that.
<s> Contacts.
<s> Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
<s> Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
<s> No.  Who's Art Mooney?
<s> But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
<s> Ye-ah.
<s> You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
<s> ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
<s> I'll mail you a letter, come on!
<s> I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!  Get that stick out of your mouth.  These things are killers, man.  Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...
<s> Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
<s> Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
<s> I'm off it!
<s> An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
<s> Go on, another time, another place.
<s> It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
<s> When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
<s> You're a poet and didn't know it.
<s> I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
<s> Mr. Doyle.
<s> I'm clean.
<s> There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
<s> Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
<s> I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Fuck you, Santa Claus!
<s> Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
<s> Yes --
<s> Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
<s> Il fallait le faire.
<s> I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
<s> Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
<s> Who's on him?
<s> Nothing in there except a New York street map.
<s> Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
<s> Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
<s> The other guy's a frog too.  Checked in at the Edison.  Had a hooker sent up.
<s> Whatta you got?
<s> Forty dollars -- was $250.
<s> Just for mistakes of parking?
<s> What was it?
<s> You remember Mary Finelli?
<s> You know what I'm saying.
<s> No, I think he's up in interrogation.
<s> Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
<s> The usual.
<s> Frank...
<s> Hello, Frank.
<s> Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do that.
<s> No.  This isn't what you think.
<s> He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
<s> I know.  Sorry, Dad.
<s> I got fed up with all the bullshit.
<s> Hello?
<s> What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
<s> What?
<s> I think I'm losing you.
<s> I never knew you, Dad.
<s> Chief?!  Is that you?
<s> Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
<s> They'll question her.  Whatever they tell her could change what happens.  No, I want you to follow her.  See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  When they do, you call the cops.
<s> It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
<s> It's not your fault, Dad.
<s> John, he's got my driver's license.
<s> He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
<s> Dad, you there?
<s> Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
<s> The Ham radio.  That's how come he didn't die in the fire.
<s> Whoa, I just...I just...
<s> April 16...?  That means she was the first.
<s> This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
<s> Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
<s> You work too hard, John.
<s> A hot shot, huh?
<s> No.  Missing teenager.  Disappeared thirty years ago.  Found her bones last week.  Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli.
<s> I don't know...
<s> We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look.
<s> I'll think of something.
<s> I vote for me.
<s> I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
<s> What?
<s> You go ahead...
<s> Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  It'll mellow you out.
<s> Why don't you help us?
<s> Keep looking.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Stop the car!  Now!!
<s> Damn you, Shelly!
<s> I just want you to like me.
<s> Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
<s> Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
<s> Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.
<s> My ass.
<s> It's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.
<s> When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
<s> It's just beginning.
<s> No.
<s> All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
<s> Yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."
<s> No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
<s> Please don't do anything crazy.
<s> -- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have your hundred grand ready.  For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
<s> Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
<s> Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
<s> 'Night, Josh.
<s> You think you can lock me up in this piss-ass prison?  Hell, this place is motel fuckin' six to me.
<s> Yeah.  Sit down a second.  There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
<s> Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
<s> I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
<s> What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
<s> Until I hear the truth.
<s> Then why were you at her house?!  She didn't want anything to do with you.
<s> No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
<s> Nothing.
<s> I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
<s> Hear what?
<s> Don't be ridiculous!
<s> But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
<s> No, I think it's just the beginning.
<s> Where is she?
<s> A wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson.
<s> Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
<s> I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
<s> There's something I haven't told you...
<s> If I go with you, he'll never speak to me again.  But I'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway...so maybe it's the right thing to do.
<s> Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
<s> Very big.
<s> Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
<s> Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
<s> Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
<s> Then you should carry a gun.
<s> I talked to her two days ago.
<s> This is how we've managed to last.
<s> In and out of bed.
<s> Why do you need a radio?
<s> That's completely crazy.
<s> Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
<s> It's your best play, Nicky.
<s> I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
<s> And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
<s> We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
<s> Joanne Bourne.
<s> I'm glad we're having this talk.
<s> You're hurting my head.
<s> This could be it!
<s> It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
<s> But the son is suppose to stop crying.
<s> Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
<s> Matthew's my grandson.
<s> It's a simple subject.
<s> "It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
<s> Because God loves a winner.
<s> Washed away.
<s> This could be it!
<s> If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
<s> How come?
<s> Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
<s> This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
<s> I kissed her while she was laughing.
<s> We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
<s> I think I remember.
<s> The fact is, I have to get going.
<s> Someone waiting for you?
<s> I haven't come to you.
<s> The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
<s> As I told you about English policemen.
<s> There's no room! And the air is lovely.
<s> Some of it good, I hope.
<s> Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.
<s> A -- a week.
<s> I say when is now -- and we will determine how.
<s> It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
<s> I --
<s> I'll send my gardener. I'm sure you'll have much to discuss.
<s> Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
<s> That's when you take advantage.
<s> That was England.
<s> Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
<s> He's "discovering" India.
<s> Have you found him?
<s> It's over.
<s> Er, no...
<s> It would be five thousand more.
<s> By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
<s> This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
<s> Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
<s> It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
<s> Something's not right.
<s> Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
<s> I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
<s> I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission.  We're already counting backwards.
<s> What's wrong with him?
<s> Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.
<s> Keep going!!  Keep going!!
<s> And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
<s> Good choice.
<s> Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
<s> You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
<s> How long?
<s> Not bad, Jerome.
<s> In case you get back before I do.
<s> We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
<s> I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
<s> They found an eyelash.
<s> We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
<s> I'm not doing it.
<s> Antonio--
<s> I get my own help.
<s> No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
<s> I bet.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I've been doing my homework.
<s> Assumed name... Houston.
<s> Better than I remembered.
<s> I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
<s> Do it my way.
<s> She's on TV.
<s> You bastard...
<s> I can handle it.
<s> I mean it.
<s> I think you liked it with him.
<s> If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
<s> El Paso.
<s> Twenty eight hundred.
<s> Not now.
<s> It's all a game, don't bother me.
<s> I don't want to hear it.
<s> Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
<s> If they are not here, he must have sent them away.
<s> They will have our description before we can get a plane.
<s> Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
<s> Thanks. Hope you do too.
<s> Two boxes of double-ought buck.
<s> Might try that.
<s> Where?
<s> Wire pull over?
<s> It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
<s> Just sandwiches...
<s> And I keep my mouth shut?
<s> How long have you been married?
<s> Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
<s> I know.
<s> When did you find out?
<s> Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
<s> 'Good.'
<s> Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
<s> Yes.
<s> Why?
<s> That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
<s> Fine...  I want to talk to you.
<s> Yes, I do.
<s> Go on.
<s> While he was here. You went about together?
<s> No. I didn't know that.
<s> You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
<s> What girl?
<s> Nice of you to come.
<s> Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
<s> I left last year.
<s> Working at Woolworths.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Wilton Estate.
<s> What?
<s> That's what I was wondering.
<s> Right.
<s> Good lad.
<s> Where you off to?
<s> How'd you find me?
<s> Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
<s> You sure?
<s> What about Keith?
<s> No.
<s> And that'll make me feel better?
<s> No, I didn't know that.
<s> It would be. If they were still living.
<s> What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
<s> I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
<s> And you should know, if I remember rightly.
<s> Sod off.
<s> Knock it off, Gerald.
<s> Ha.
<s> That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred.
<s> ...they hold on to their money...
<s> I'm not?
<s> They killed the goose.
<s> And now...
<s> I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
<s> Eh...?
<s> Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."
<s> For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
<s> That's right...
<s> That's the truth...
<s> Huh.
<s> What?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.  Not actually.
<s> That's right.
<s> I...
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Huh?
<s> He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
<s> Down the street.
<s> Where was I?
<s> Where did Moss...?  I...
<s> I'll be at the restaurant. </pre> </html>
<s> Go to lunch, George.
<s> Will you get out of here.  Will you get out of here.  Will you.  I'm trying to run an office here.  Will you go to lunch?  Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch? 
<s> Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
<s> You're done, come down, and let's...
<s> I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
<s> Get in the goddamn room.
<s> ...do you want to go downtown...?
<s> Roma.
<s> You're saying that I'm fucked.
<s> Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
<s> What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.
<s> Twenty percent.
<s> You want something off the B list?
<s> The deal still stands, our other thing.
<s> It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
<s> You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
<s> Yes.  Mmm.  Yes.  Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it.  I'm talking to you, I'm trying to tell you something.
<s> You're so full of shit.
<s> Was it?
<s> Mmm.
<s> Eighty-two thousand dollars.
<s> "Bruce, Harriet...Fuck me, believe in yourself..."
<s> Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
<s> Ricky?...That I don't care they stole the contracts?
<s> "I want to tell you something, Harriet..."
<s> Bruce..."I don't want to fuck around with you.  I don't want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have to look back on this.  I do, too.  I came here to do good for you and me.  For both of us.  Why take an interim position? 
<s> I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
<s> Yes.
<s> Me.
<s> I've got to get Ray to O'Hare...  Come on, let's hustle...  John!  Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock. 
<s> To change our minds.
<s> We're going to speak to her.
<s> The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
<s> Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
<s> And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
<s> They didn't get my contracts.
<s> Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
<s> I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
<s> I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
<s> To do business.
<s> Connie.
<s> Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent?
<s> Michael...
<s> I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
<s> That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.
<s>  My two friends have my share of the money.  I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
<s> Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
<s> What's that?
<s> What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
<s> Beautiful.
<s> Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
<s> Yeah, give me a minute.
<s> But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
<s> Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
<s> Alright.  I'm going to go outside and talk to Fredo.
<s> I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
<s> No questions.
<s> He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
<s> That's my brother.  Nothing could get him away from that two mule town.  He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.
<s> We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
<s> Very well.
<s> This meeting is adjourned.
<s> If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want.
<s> It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago.
<s> I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
<s> You would have killed his brother?
<s> I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
<s> The baby I lost...
<s> You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
<s> Get out of my hotel.
<s> Yes.
<s> I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.
<s> The money was sent.
<s> I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
<s> No, I'm fine.
<s> He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
<s> That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.
<s> Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?
<s> I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there.
<s> Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
<s> Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
<s> I thought we would meet alone.
<s> I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
<s> It's important.
<s> The same assurance we got from you.
<s> How much more a month?
<s> I didn't mean to...
<s> If you enjoy it, you should do it.
<s> You mean us?
<s> Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.
<s> I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
<s> Expect nothing fancy.
<s> No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
<s> I'm not going to hurt anyone.
<s> I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke.
<s> I put him to bed.  He's not there?
<s> Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
<s> No.  Iced tea's fine.
<s> I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
<s> What did she mean by going flooey?
<s> What was wrong?
<s> Broke is more like it.
<s> Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
<s> But why?
<s> You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
<s> Did anyone laugh?
<s> Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
<s> No, I -- you're a homosexual.
<s> You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
<s> Do you miss it?
<s> I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
<s> I told you.  I don't like to talk about that.
<s> You're the one who started it.
<s> Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
<s> You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
<s> Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
<s> I don't remember that one.
<s> Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.
<s> I haven't done a damn thing with you!
<s> Ooooh.
<s> Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
<s> Oh, David, stop being a nanny.
<s> Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
<s> Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
<s> Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
<s> Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
<s> I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
<s> No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
<s> It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
<s> Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
<s> Of course.
<s> Righto.  Let me see.
<s> Don't go away.
<s> Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
<s> And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
<s> I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
<s> Point-five ...
<s> I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...
<s> I knew you'd say that, too --
<s> You got no choice. It's over.
<s> What for?
<s> Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
<s> Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...
<s> Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
<s> It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
<s> Lazy ... Lazy ... I ask you, Freb: what's the matter with kids today?
<s> Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
<s> We don't -- ?
<s> Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ...
<s> How's Kip?
<s> I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
<s> I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
<s> I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
<s> Damn crooks is everywhere --
<s> What do you got ... ?
<s> Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
<s> It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic?"
<s> I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
<s> I don't know. What -- ?
<s> Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like
<s> Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.
<s> No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
<s> Hey -
<s> What's wrong with her -- ?
<s> I always thought you'd follow me up.
<s> The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
<s> Are you considering a comeback tour?
<s> If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
<s> In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And...
<s> She left...
<s> Not really --
<s> Billy, how are you?
<s> Me? Why would I get into that shit?
<s> I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?
<s> What are you gonna do?
<s> I'm just having my last few drinks.
<s> Shit.
<s> What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
<s> Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
<s> I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
<s> With what?
<s> But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
<s> Paul will calm down. You'll see.
<s> Just get me out.
<s> Where's the stuff?
<s> Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
<s> I got scared.
<s> Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
<s> Paulie was just talking about him.
<s> What?
<s> It's been six months.
<s> I gotta talk to you.
<s> What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
<s> Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
<s> How?
<s> They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?
<s> What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
<s> It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?
<s> He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
<s> I don't want them left back.
<s> No, he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home. Fuckin' lights and everything!
<s> I don't know yet.
<s> Next week.
<s> No one. I didn't have the number.
<s> Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
<s> Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
<s> Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
<s> What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
<s> Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY
<s> Yeah, it is.
<s> And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.
<s> What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
<s> You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
<s> Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
<s> Seven.
<s> It's touching me.
<s> Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!
<s> Which one's your building?
<s> Of course.
<s> It's an integer proof.
<s> C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
<s> I don't know what it's called.
<s> Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
<s> I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
<s> I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
<s> No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
<s> The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math.  But it's only given out every four years.
<s> This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
<s> You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
<s> I'll be okay.
<s> Not at all.
<s> Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
<s> Now wait a minute, Gerry--
<s> I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
<s> That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
<s> There is somebody...
<s> He was my roommate in college.
<s> You guys are fuckin' sick.
<s> Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
<s> Like what, Will?
<s> C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
<s> Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
<s> That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else?
<s> I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
<s> Haven't called her.
<s> No, I don't.
<s> I didn't want the job.
<s> Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way.  And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you.
<s> It's not your fault.
<s> Yeah, I think so.
<s> Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
<s> I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
<s> It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
<s> Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
<s> Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
<s> I bet your parents were happy to pay.
<s> No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
<s> Pretty boring, I guess.
<s> They don't come over here that much.
<s> Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
<s> Not tonight.
<s> No.
<s> Clearly.
<s> I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
<s> What?
<s> I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
<s> Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
<s> Let 'er go, Gallagher!
<s> Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
<s> Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!
<s> Naw. They paroled me.
<s> Well, we ain't out a it yet.
<s> Two.
<s> Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
<s> Got a warrant?
<s> Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
<s> Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
<s> Have a little snort?
<s> Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
<s> I been in the penitentiary for four years. 
<s> He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.
<s> If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture.
<s> Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
<s> Lissen, I heard that before--
<s> Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
<s> Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
<s> But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Naw--not much!
<s> What you mean?
<s> You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
<s> Ain't a-goin', thas all...
<s> Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
<s> You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.
<s> Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
<s> Now don't get sassy, Ma.
<s> Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
<s> I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa. We're the people. 
<s> Ya say we're acrost?
<s> Since before they stopped us las' night.
<s> On a gallon a gas?  Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.
<s> Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
<s> It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
<s> He was a good man.
<s> Good-by, Tommy.
<s> I know, ma'am... on'y it's for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it, an' she's hongry.
<s> There, them stripy ones.
<s> I know that! But *where* they gone?
<s> But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
<s> Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
<s> I wisht it was day.
<s> I won't--  --if you won't tell what *I* done!
<s> I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
<s> You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
<s> I'm Martin Blank.
<s> Whatever I can get away with.
<s> Overflowing with love.
<s> You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
<s> Yes.
<s> Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
<s> Here is now there. There is here.
<s> Okay.
<s> Yes.
<s> Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
<s> Like heroin?
<s> No.
<s> Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
<s> Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
<s> That sounds pretty interesting...
<s> If he does our job, he's our job.
<s> No...
<s> It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
<s> See you next week.
<s> Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
<s> Yeah. I guess we did.
<s> You too.
<s> That's too bad.
<s> Work's good for the soul.
<s> Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...
<s> Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
<s> It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
<s> You too.
<s> She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
<s> We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
<s> Huh?
<s> What about him?
<s> Mom?
<s> Fine -- I'll take my bath.
<s> Fine.
<s> I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
<s> Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
<s> There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
<s> Hi.
<s> If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
<s> You're right. Good.
<s> NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
<s> I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
<s> Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity.  I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you.
<s> Exactly...
<s> If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana?
<s> That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
<s> Doing what?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
<s> Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
<s> I don't understa-
<s> Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
<s> You want to take a walk with me?
<s> Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?
<s> We have a business manager. The best around.
<s> Either fight the way things are or accept it.
<s> Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
<s> Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway.
<s> I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
<s> He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
<s> Well, I am going to go after lunch.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't think Warren would go for that.
<s> There's no hurry. Take you time.
<s> Sure.
<s> You want to go to a movie tonight?
<s> I'm okay... I'm okay.
<s> I know. Amazing.
<s> YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
<s> Alright sir.
<s> Hackers of the World, Unite!
<s> Shh!
<s> Again?  Yeah sure.
<s> Super hero like even.
<s> Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
<s> ...as they snoop onto us.
<s> Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
<s> Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.  He isn't to consort with his computer friends.  The secret service is really out to get him.  Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?
<s> Yeah, mom?
<s> Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
<s> Nah. I don't play well with others.
<s> What's this one eat?
<s> We did it!
<s> Yeah?
<s> You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
<s> I'm sorry, I can't.
<s> Okay. I'll copy it.
<s> The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
<s> I'll make it up to you!
<s> Yeah.
<s> Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
<s> The rabbit is in the administration system.
<s> One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it...
<s> Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
<s> Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
<s> I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
<s> Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
<s> Sh, sh sh sh sh.
<s> Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
<s> Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
<s> No, you don't understand.
<s> Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
<s> Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search.
<s> You guys always look great.
<s> I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.
<s> Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
<s> I'm not calling the fire department.
<s> How many people in the bus?
<s> Haddonfield. It's a four hour drive. You can reach me through the local police. If you didn't find him in four hours, I'm sure I will.
<s> Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
<s> I don't want to.
<s> Double scoops?
<s> You bet.
<s> He's coming to get me Rachel.
<s> I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
<s> This is great Rachel. Come on.
<s> No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
<s> Don't you mean what you do best?
<s> Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.
<s> Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
<s> 10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
<s> Right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs.  Brady, you know how to use a gun?
<s> Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah
<s> I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
<s> The guys think I'm too smart.
<s> He can still watch.
<s> Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
<s> This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
<s> I can't.
<s> Come with me.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> Lee Brackett.
<s> Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
<s> Could have...
<s> You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
<s> I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
<s> As usual, I don't have anything to do.
<s> Have a good time.
<s> I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
<s> There was no one outside.
<s> What did he look like?
<s> And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
<s> Was it the bogyman?
<s> There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
<s> You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
<s> What did you use before?
<s> Only minimum security.
<s> Are you really interested?
<s> Look at this.
<s> A lot of works.
<s> Uh --
<s> Oh, it's magnificent!
<s> Okay.
<s> Uh...
<s> Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.
<s> What makes you think we're more interesting?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
<s> Yes.
<s> ...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
<s> No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.
<s> Yeah.  It's kind of a weird place, actually.  A lotta wall space. 
<s> 'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
<s> Could you--
<s> Bye.
<s> Oh, yeah.
<s> Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see her wind up settled.  She's a tense one. 
<s> Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you.
<s> Not because of me, I hope.
<s> Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
<s> I can't say anything!
<s> Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
<s> I know it isn't.
<s> Oh, all the time.
<s> Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.
<s> Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
<s> Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I forgot.
<s> Was I?
<s> No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
<s> Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
<s> Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.
<s> I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
<s> That thought doesn't terrify you?
<s> Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!
<s> Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
<s> Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. 
<s> Mmm...
<s> ...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. 
<s> Oh, Frederick!
<s> Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
<s> Oh...
<s> But not you.
<s> I can't keep my mind on the show.
<s> You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
<s> I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.
<s> No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
<s> A week ago, I bought a rifle.
<s> I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
<s> Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
<s> Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
<s> Oh...
<s> Like what?
<s> I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
<s> ...you know?  I, uh...
<s> Thanks, thanks.
<s> That's a beauty!
<s> Football!
<s> Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
<s> Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
<s> With a, with a stranger?  With a--
<s> The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
<s> Oh, sure.
<s> When does Frederick ever come with her?
<s> It's, uh, you never know--
<s> Well, how about this?
<s> I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
<s> So what's new?
<s> You're grateful, but you resent me.
<s> Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!
<s> I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
<s> I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--
<s> I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
<s> No!
<s> And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
<s> I recall you.
<s> We didn't hit it off.
<s> I've done no television whatsoever. No.
<s> It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
<s> Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't know how you're gonna top that.
<s> Mmm, what?
<s> At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
<s> Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
<s> Oh...
<s> April?
<s> Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
<s> ...you don't have to think.
<s> They're offering... 
<s> ...I was <u>working</u>...
<s> Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
<s> Orderly.
<s> I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
<s> And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? 
<s> I know her by the Back.
<s> Yeah, so where is he?
<s> Impossible.
<s> ...are you alright, sir...?
<s> Seen what, sir..?
<s> Good evening, Dr. Lechter.  Thank you for coming.  I am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
<s> You said the <u>bad</u> news...
<s> For a consideration.
<s> Well, well, well, well, well, she went <u>in</u> there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon. Went in there with her gun, Came out, <u>without</u> the Felon, with<u>out</u> the gun...
<s> Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment....
<s> Hey, you know, I never thought of that...
<s> ...should love to correct your error. 
<s> And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
<s> You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
<s> You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
<s> Take mine.  Ah. And is that your <u>wife</u>...  Signora.  Can it be that you are lovelier, even, than at our last encounter...?
<s> Yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. I won't be a minute...
<s> Thank you, that's not responsive.  How did our Miss Drumgo get...
<s> What is that that smells so wonderful.
<s> Thanks to <u>you</u>...
<s> Do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I'm going to work.
<s> Because we cannot <u>pay</u>...
<s> No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
<s> Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.
<s> I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
<s> ...no...
<s> Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but... 
<s> Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
<s> What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
<s> How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
<s> And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
<s> Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
<s> That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
<s> Yeah, his lack of intelligence. Sorry, Wendy, but as learning disabilities go, stupidity is often overlooked.
<s> It is?  I don't know about this, Wichita. Am I even right for Talia?                         ] What About Wendy?

<s> Talking while kissing.
<s> Do you really think I care?
<s> Betty Finn. Gosh.....
<s> It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.
<s> Like last night, Veronica?
<s> Because you're an idiot.
<s> I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
<s> Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
<s> Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
<s> Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
<s> Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
<s> I don't know. Should you?
<s> See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.
<s> "To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
<s> Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
<s> You must have had fun.
<s> You kids are making too much damn noise.
<s> You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?
<s> Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
<s> Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old for that crap. Let's give him a scare though.
<s> I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
<s> May<u>be</u>.
<s> Superb.
<s> That's three things.
<s> Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
<s> Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
<s> Sure. Ciao.

<s> I just want to be on my own for a while.
<s> From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
<s> You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
<s> Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
<s> Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.
<s> stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
<s> I put on a lot of weight over Christmas.
<s> Somebody's got to help us!
<s> It doesn't matter.
<s> Him . . .
<s> You're such an incredible woman.
<s> Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
<s> Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.
<s> I understand, I think. Other women?
<s> Did I ever talk about the accident?
<s> Just get better okay?
<s> I've been in here before.
<s> No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
<s> For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
<s> Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?
<s> No please make yourself at home.
<s> All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
<s> I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
<s> I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
<s> I surrender...
<s> The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
<s> You must have been very proud of yourselves...
<s> I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
<s> Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
<s> Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
<s> I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
<s> In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
<s> What am I, a goddamn postman?  I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!
<s> I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
<s> I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart.  You could, like, rest up for the jump.
<s> Lighten up, John.  You think <u>you</u> got problems for Chrissake?
<s> I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
<s> And give a deposition to the jUdge.
<s> On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything.  I can't tell him what we're up to...
<s> Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
<s> I got your bail continued.
<s> We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
<s> And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
<s> I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
<s> Mister LaPlante...
<s> 'Cause I'm up to my ass in shit is why.  I'm broke, plus I got legal problems... Nobody was asking for me, huh?
<s> You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?
<s> Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
<s> I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
<s> YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
<s> Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
<s> He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...
<s> If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
<s> Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
<s> You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
<s> In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
<s> Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
<s> Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
<s> Yes.
<s> You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
<s> Gale... you're a very nice person. I wouldn't want to hurt you... in any way...
<s> It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.
<s> You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!
<s> And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
<s> You said all the passengers were accounted for...
<s> A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?
<s> Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
<s> You didn't?
<s> An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
<s> They're really white.
<s> Right.
<s> Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
<s> Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
<s> I understand that.
<s> -- a sense of proportion.
<s> Maybe I could take a look at it now.
<s> Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
<s> I'm thirsty.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
<s> No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
<s> That's okay, Mom.
<s> You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
<s> Honey, are you okay?
<s> What next?!  -- A strange bra under my pillow!
<s> I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
<s> Fuck you, Philip.
<s> Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.
<s> I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
<s> There's always an excuse, isn't there?
<s> I have a cold.
<s> No joke, Lieutenant.
<s> Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
<s> What is it?
<s> It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
<s> We don't have any proof of that.
<s> A few days ago.
<s> I already told you.  I took a walk.
<s> Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
<s> No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
<s> Leaving what?
<s> I'm sure they will.
<s> She's the King's cousin.
<s> I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
<s> That doesn't matter.
<s> No -- after you.
<s> She's a treasure she is.
<s> It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
<s> Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
<s> I lied.
<s> Where do you go when your mind drifts?
<s> Why not?
<s> Aye.
<s> Where I'm going you cannot follow.
<s> Because, it's for the best.  There are somethings that are better left unexplained.
<s> Because it's my name.
<s> Jennifer.
<s> Meet me Tratino's at nine.
<s> You're twenty minutes late.
<s> I wanted to get to know you better.
<s> Not unless they're immortal.
<s> And the other one -- he is like you?
<s> What?  How?
<s> And this?
<s> I know, Paul.
<s> I do not know -- and even if I did...
<s> Aye -- that I would, lass.
<s> I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
<s> Fine.
<s> I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
<s> I can take care of myself.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
<s> It was stolen.
<s> What do you want to do?
<s> You think we should take that chance?
<s> She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
<s> We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
<s> Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
<s> Like what?
<s> That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
<s> I'm not going to die for this!
<s> Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
<s> The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
<s> Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
<s> Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
<s> Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before.  That little fuck untied himself anyway.
<s> Okey-doke.
<s> I don't eat junk food.
<s> I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
<s> You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
<s> I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
<s> We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
<s> Go!  If you get out, maybe you can help the police!
<s> Mars?  What are you doing?
<s> Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
<s> Did he say if she was shooting at him?
<s> They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
<s> I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
<s> Order your men to stand down.
<s> Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
<s> Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
<s> You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
<s> Not until the man calls.
<s> Where's the office?
<s> No!  They're right here --
<s> A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
<s> I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
<s> Of course.
<s> Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
<s> No. I work at the Mille Collines.
<s> I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
<s> No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
<s> Yes we have.
<s> Well rewarded Those were his words.
<s> I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
<s> I'll be over.
<s> After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
<s> No.
<s> Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
<s> You have no whiskey?
<s> Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.
<s> I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
<s> Promoted. House Manager.
<s> I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
<s> Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
<s> That will take time.
<s> He will be here.
<s> No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?
<s> I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
<s> I will give you my house.
<s> Move? Where to?
<s> They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
<s> He wants your wisdom.
<s> We must do something.
<s> I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
<s> But who is left?
<s> A kiss.
<s> Yes.
<s> We wait until 7:00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children.
<s> No! Sit down now.
<s> What sort of plan?
<s> Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
<s> Why?
<s> Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
<s> Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
<s> What is his room number?
<s> -- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
<s> Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
<s> Not at all!
<s> It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first.
<s> More to the point. Where's our host?
<s> C'mon.
<s> Is she alright?
<s> I don't know!!
<s> -- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.
<s> Hell NO!! The House will kill ya!
<s> Take the gun.
<s> Why?
<s> I don't think so...
<s> No...not air --
<s> Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work.
<s> It'll have to do.
<s> How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
<s> Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
<s> Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
<s> A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
<s> Where is she?
<s> What?
<s> I wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn't tested 100% safe.
<s> I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
<s> Something with the power, I don't know!!
<s> Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
<s> Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
<s> I can't comment until I get paid.
<s> What's going on?
<s> Why not?
<s> Oh, dear.
<s> Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
<s> No!
<s> Good-bye.
<s> Sure.
<s> Maybe it was Colleen...
<s> Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
<s> We're going to go someplace new.
<s> We'll get it later.
<s> Where is she now?
<s> My God, I heard something!
<s> Ok.  If you want this room, you can have it.
<s> Fight it back Aubrey.  Fight it back as hard as you can!
<s> Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
<s> Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
<s> Were you fooling with the power?
<s> She's gone!
<s> Aubrey!
<s> Should I...
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> I'm ok.
<s> I'm all right...
<s> We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
<s> Before.
<s> Yeah, they told us this was the best.
<s> You'll have to settle for turkey.
<s> Oh, that's nice...
<s> How can I help you?
<s> Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things...
<s> Good night.
<s> Did you remove anything in the cellar!
<s> I didn't do anything...God saved her...
<s> And what would you do?
<s> I know what I saw.
<s> OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
<s> You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
<s> Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
<s> And why are you back?  Why are we here?
<s> Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.
<s> I don't know ...
<s> Then tell me what to do.
<s> Right.  Right!
<s> I'm trying to quit.
<s> The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
<s> Who's that?
<s> Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
<s> Can we see?
<s> A prize?  For what?
<s> I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
<s> On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
<s> Not quite.
<s> Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
<s> That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
<s> Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
<s> C'mon.  It'll be great.
<s> Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
<s> It doesn't have to be.  Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails.
<s> Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
<s> Why try?
<s> Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I...
<s> You sound disappointed.
<s> "Maybe we're ragged and funny."
<s> Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
<s> Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb...
<s> Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
<s> Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
<s> Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
<s> Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
<s> If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
<s> How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."
<s> Yes.
<s> Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.
<s> You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.
<s> Alchemy.
<s> And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
<s> Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
<s> You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
<s> I'm supposed to fall for that?
<s> Sharp.
<s> With a little jazz.
<s> We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
<s> Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
<s> I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
<s> Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
<s> Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat...
<s> Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
<s> Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
<s> Why yes, do you know it?
<s> Oh, no, really, I --
<s> ...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
<s> Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
<s> Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
<s> Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
<s> I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
<s> What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
<s> That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
<s> Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.
<s> Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
<s> He grins wolfishly.
<s> Terrific.
<s> What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
<s> Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
<s> Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
<s> Yes sir...
<s> Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
<s> Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
<s> -- tough titty toenails!
<s> Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
<s> You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid.
<s> But, sir! --
<s> Get out of my sight.
<s> Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
<s> She sits down.
<s> The mark notices.
<s> He don't look wise.
<s> She is!
<s> I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
<s> But you didn't have to come up here.
<s> No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
<s> Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
<s> You can't really believe that.
<s> Yes, thank you.
<s> No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
<s> Why did you come in here?
<s> Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
<s> I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
<s> I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
<s> I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
<s> I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
<s> But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
<s> In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
<s> Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
<s> Emotion tricks all of us, Mrs. Rand.  And you are a woman with a very strong conscience.  That conscience has been tormenting you. The rest is coincidence.  There is no such thing as a Zombie.  The dead do not come back to life. Death is final.
<s> No thank you. We should be off.
<s> That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
<s> Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
<s> So early?
<s> Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
<s> So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
<s> What's on your mind? Don't --
<s> Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
<s> Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
<s> Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you.
<s> Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
<s> Hnnn.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
<s> And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
<s> -- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --
<s> Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her.
<s> Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
<s> Let me.
<s> Nobody.
<s> I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
<s> It'll warm you up.
<s> It's not like we're too busy.
<s> Social work?
<s> Forget how to ride a bike.
<s> I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
<s> And you're still trying to get me into bed.
<s> I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
<s> Aha! I could sense the vibe.
<s> Am I right or am I right?
<s> Moisture! Moisture!
<s> Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
<s> Yeah. Yours?
<s> Yeah? See ya.
<s> I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down.
<s> Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
<s> Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
<s> What's the D.A. got them on?
<s> Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
<s> But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
<s> I know.
<s> Why?
<s> Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
<s> No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
<s> No.
<s> I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
<s> What?
<s> That's right.
<s> Seven years.
<s> Don't do this, Hap...
<s> Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.
<s> Who?
<s> Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
<s> Told you I could write an ending.
<s> Then so was mine...
<s> I didn't want to kill her, Will.
<s> And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
<s> You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
<s> She is.
<s> Follow me - that way - through my cell -
<s> You let them do it.
<s> It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.
<s> You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
<s> And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.
<s> I took your life. He gave you another one.
<s> The workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie -
<s> They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
<s> How devilishly clever.
<s> Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
<s> Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.
<s> How do you mean, start?
<s> Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
<s> Sure...
<s> You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
<s> Do you think so?
<s> Tell me about him. You must have lernt something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me!
<s> Respect me a little then. I'm the only life you know.
<s> I don't pretend to know.
<s> I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
<s> Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
<s> Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive.
<s> Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---
<s> CLAUDIA!!!
<s> You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
<s> Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
<s> So shall we begin?  What do yo do?
<s> Perhaps lucky for both of us.
<s> We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
<s> You're not lying to me, are you?
<s> Can a vampire feel love?
<s> How could I not? She had to know.
<s> Is that bad?
<s> July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
<s> Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
<s> Phones went down a few minutes ago.
<s> Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
<s> Stupid. What were you thinkng?
<s> Storm is what makes it interesting. Thass why all the fish are up. Less hook us a couple big ones.
<s> Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
<s> Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway.
<s> Julie, you left four messages... Four.
<s> No, I'm the King of the World.
<s> Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
<s> Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
<s> Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
<s> No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
<s> Will you try...for me, please?
<s> It's gonna be great.
<s> Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
<s> Fine. Show me the body.
<s> Wait, it's Nancy --
<s> I'm fine.
<s> It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
<s> Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
<s> He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
<s> Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
<s> Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
<s> I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
<s> Hello?
<s> Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
<s> How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
<s> We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station?
<s> And so could you -- crazy fool.
<s> Must have missed the sign.
<s> How's the water?
<s> Or even spirit messages from the next world.
<s> No one can take my father's place.
<s> I think she went to bed  I saw her going toward the house
<s> Poor Cathy --
<s> If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
<s> In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then - I'll not die  I'll watch - they shall not hurt you.
<s> What an odd question!
<s> That should decide it or you --
<s> It was, the plague
<s> How do you know what my father thought - -
<s> Mr. Davis seems a good prospect young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
<s> You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you - I'll warn them against you.
<s> I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in - entombed  imprisoned..
<s> Why -- no not before Thea came 
<s> It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
<s> It is for that he hates me.
<s> No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it - he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
<s> Who?
<s> Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
<s> Our clothes are dry.
<s> It isn't me!
<s> No, of course not.
<s> Where is she?
<s> Yes, but George . . .
<s> I know. I know.
<s> Hiya, George!
<s> Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
<s> Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
<s> Goodbye, Sam.
<s> All in . . .
<s> Came back three days ago.
<s> Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
<s> Maybe you were born older, George.
<s> Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.
<s> Have a good time, son.
<s> She was here first.
<s> Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
<s> Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
<s> It's important.
<s> Right down here.
<s> You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say . . .
<s> Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
<s> Have you notified the police?
<s> Five hundred dollars.
<s> I don't like coconuts.
<s> I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
<s> What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
<s> About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
<s> Didn't you tell her?
<s> Do you like it?
<s> Well, then, sit down.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Don't you like her?
<s> Mary . . .
<s> Please, let's not stop, George.
<s> Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
<s> Hi.
<s> I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
<s> Lassos the stork! You mean you . . . What is it, a boy or a girl?
<s> Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.
<s> Soon, dark eyes, soon.
<s> Is she responsible for the punch?
<s> Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you.
<s> We better go back in.
<s> Listen to Andy, Sean.
<s> What the hell, we're steering for it.
<s> Gangway, Turkies!
<s> The rope!  The rope!
<s> Oh, yeah.  Sure.
<s> N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
<s> Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
<s> Not the drugstore!
<s> But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
<s> Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
<s> What's that supposed to mean?
<s> You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
<s> That's it.
<s> Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
<s> Door's locked.
<s> Mrs. Silvera.
<s> As far as the office.
<s> Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
<s> For me?
<s> That's great too.  Gorgeous.
<s> ...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
<s> Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
<s> Maybe they are!
<s> Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
<s> That's what he said.
<s> No.  Find your brother, okay?
<s> Now I really want to see it.
<s> Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
<s> None at all.  I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Nope.
<s> Just like this.
<s> Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
<s> That you'll put down a blanket.  I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them.
<s> What Kids?  Who went out?
<s> Anything?
<s> What the hell is it?
<s> I'm not sure I can.
<s> Name it.
<s> Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
<s> Might as well.
<s> Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
<s> I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
<s> No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
<s> No.
<s> Want another one?
<s> I guess.
<s> Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
<s> Just put your mask on.
<s> Up.
<s> I talked you into this?
<s> Are you coming...?
<s> Yes.
<s> It's easier to lure sharks at night.
<s> No.
<s> Me, too.
<s> Sure.  Let's go.
<s> It was removed from Charlie Overman's body.
<s> You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
<s> Who's going to do it?
<s> On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
<s> Fine.  Have them do some.
<s> I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
<s> Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
<s> The only Great White in captivity, Calvin.  All those people standing in line...
<s> Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
<s> Thanks for helping.
<s> Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
<s> Get ready to go.
<s> Ten minutes ago.
<s> Don't blame yourself.
<s> Not good enough.
<s> ... Massachussettans aren't.
<s> Well, wait till you see the rest.
<s> Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it.
<s> Why you sonuvabitch...
<s> The one that goes underwater?
<s> What, hon?
<s> Remember, skiers stay up longer.
<s> Now what?
<s> Aww, can't I keep it?
<s> Hey, I don't want to hear.
<s> Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
<s> So was Dad.
<s> Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
<s> We're in love.
<s> No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
<s> Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
<s> Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
<s> My tea set.  I got my tea set.  Thank you....
<s> He told me you both did....
<s> My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....
<s> We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
<s> I don't know...You...I don't know.
<s> She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....
<s> I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
<s> Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
<s> I'm not doing anything.
<s> You check it....
<s> Mommy lets me....
<s> I'm fine....
<s> Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
<s> I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
<s> I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
<s> I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....
<s> I'm the captain of this majestic ship.  It goes where I take it....
<s> Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
<s> If you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute.
<s> No, you're not....
<s> No!
<s> You'll be sorry.
<s> Good.  I have two left....
<s> Why?
<s> A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....
<s> She said it was coming....
<s> They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   They don't care what it is....
<s> Feathers all over the place....
<s> You didn't stick them on right....
<s> Put me down, damnit....
<s> Where the hell's the beer...?
<s> It's not a bad life, Jake....
<s> I've struck the mother-lode.  I'm counting... spade work....
<s> Lots of times....
<s> So far..
<s> What she's got.  Nine knots....
<s> As long as he's been here....
<s> How long has he been here...?
<s> Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
<s> I am...You must know something about him....
<s> You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again....
<s> I live to hear the sound...You all right?
<s> 'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
<s> 'Snuck up on me....'
<s> Don't flatter yourself.... 
<s> Oh, Jake... 
<s> Deputy Brody will take care of it personally.
<s> I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
<s> We only got one .. He doesn't drive.
<s> You heard. Look for the knife.
<s> Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
<s> Thank Christ we got a witness.
<s> Car accident.
<s> Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
<s> You don't really believe this?
<s> <u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
<s> Are you sure you didn't call?
<s> You ain't going in alone?
<s> Three or four.
<s> Once.
<s> And did they?
<s> What are you looking for?
<s> I've heard you call him Freddy.
<s> I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
<s> What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?
<s> My hands?
<s> Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's.
<s> Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
<s> Yes.
<s> I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
<s> Of course I would ..
<s> It was probably the wind.
<s> No.
<s> Do you pray?
<s> Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
<s> Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
<s> I can't identify him ..
<s> Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
<s> Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
<s> Whass going on here?
<s> Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
<s> Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
<s> And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
<s> That's right.
<s> Let's go.  I'll drive you. _ 45.
<s> Listen to me, it's over.
<s> Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
<s> Thanks.
<s> And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
<s> Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
<s> Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
<s> No no no.  I just underestimated her...  her temper, I guess.  Why are we even talking about this?
<s> What?
<s> Easy, easy --
<s> This rig? Phht.  No problem.
<s> Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
<s> If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
<s> No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
<s> It's only a half-hour show, Rod.
<s> It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
<s> I'll give it everything.
<s> I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
<s> Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
<s> Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
<s> Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
<s> You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
<s> Great word.  Towel?
<s> Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
<s> Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
<s> Rod, get on the camel.
<s> Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
<s> Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
<s> Go.  Flee.
<s> --so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
<s> I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25.
<s> And say what?  "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"
<s> Came here to fire you, Jerry.
<s> You'll lose.
<s> -- and I'll get 'em.
<s> Yeah I know.  I did.
<s> We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
<s> Right up ahead, buddy --
<s> I'm scared.  What is it?
<s> Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
<s> He's this way.
<s> We're not going anywhere, I promise.
<s> Who's that?
<s> I didn't know, there were two islands.
<s> We should take it with us to signal any planes.
<s> Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
<s> Raptors, mostly.
<s> Goodbye, Alan.
<s> In Costa Rica?
<s> Yeah.
<s> No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
<s> No we're not.
<s> Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
<s> Back out! Move!
<s> That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
<s> It doesn't matter what I think.
<s> Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
<s> You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?
<s> I want to see the nesting ground!
<s> Not without a shot of the nest.
<s> I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
<s> No.  Richard talked to his parents.
<s> Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
<s> Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.
<s> I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
<s> Piss.
<s> She's nuts.
<s> Where's Kelly?
<s> I have to find Kelly!
<s> Look!  Sarah!
<s> It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
<s> Are you insane?!
<s> You think this is all a joke?
<s> Can the kid walk?
<s> Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
<s> That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
<s> I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
<s> Oh my God.
<s> But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
<s> If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order.
<s> They smell.
<s> They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
<s> Stick to my heels.

<s> Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
<s> Dorkatops!
<s> Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
<s> Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
<s> John, John.
<s> I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
<s> There's no sign of him anywhere.
<s> Sure.
<s> Who is this? What's going on?
<s> What about that other guy?
<s> That's my job.
<s> I know how this sounds, but that's what happened.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
<s> This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
<s> So?
<s> So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
<s> No. You've told me all I need to know.
<s> Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
<s> Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
<s> He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
<s> Not yet.
<s> A cameraman caught him on videotape. Joe, I saw an entire sheriff's squad fighting and losing against an enemy that wasn't there...
<s> And if he's not?
<s> Let's split up. You take the left side, I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex.
<s> My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
<s> Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
<s> What was the matter with it?
<s> I don't know what you could have read.
<s> Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
<s> A man must eat --  And drink.
<s> Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.
<s> No, I left it in his office.
<s> I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
<s> He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
<s> It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
<s> -- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.
<s> In a small way.
<s> I do.
<s> No.
<s> ... All right.
<s> What of it?
<s> People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
<s> It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
<s> No -- not this time.
<s> -- Accident and Compensation Association.
<s> Eight -- and seven months.
<s> I don't know.
<s> What makes you think so?
<s> -- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
<s> That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
<s> You mean you've actually begun some?
<s> It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
<s> That's obvious, isn't it?  We have an opening for a new member.
<s> Yes.  Isn't it there?
<s> You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
<s> It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.
<s> You look tired.
<s> Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go.
<s> It's ... lovely.
<s> To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
<s> Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
<s> I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
<s> How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
<s> I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
<s> We're leaving.
<s> Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
<s> Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
<s> What?
<s> How about Ann? Is she going with you?
<s> Compassion.
<s> She was with you after she left Frank.
<s> Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
<s> No, that's not --
<s> From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
<s> Here please.
<s> Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
<s> Will you let me go then?
<s> I said yes, I see.
<s> Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.
<s> Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
<s> Mm.
<s> What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
<s> But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
<s> Most of them.
<s> You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
<s> Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
<s> -- OK --
<s> No thanks.
<s> It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
<s> You said you wanted these.
<s> You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
<s> Yeah, you got to me.
<s> Arlyn Page.
<s> Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
<s> I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
<s> I don't like getting splashed.
<s> What am I supposed to say?
<s> I was wondering what that was.
<s> Drop it.
<s> Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
<s> I am.
<s> I better keep looking.
<s> Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
<s> Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
<s> All right, but I'm going to see that list.
<s> Just send me a money order.
<s> Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
<s> I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
<s> I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
<s> Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
<s> I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
<s> Nobody's seen that.
<s> Yes sir, we know he --
<s> He's in his room, playing.
<s> Wow!  French toast, really?
<s> I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
<s> Mom, I mean dad?
<s> I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
<s> You're no bargain either, pal.
<s> Don't let the bedbugs bite.
<s> It's okay, son...I'm here... Just a little more to go... Don't worry, son...I'm here...
<s> Sure.  Lots of times.
<s> I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
<s> Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.
<s> Why does he decide?
<s> Where will my toys be?
<s> Objection!
<s> No questions.
<s> Eight, almost nine years.
<s> Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.  And if I call, you lose the commission.
<s> You have?
<s> No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
<s> I don't know, Jim...
<s> Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
<s> Are you firing me, Jim?
<s> Yes, what?
<s> I can't.  I've got Billy to take care of.
<s> Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
<s> Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
<s> First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved.  Got it?
<s> Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work.
<s> OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
<s> Ted, don't be so hostile.
<s> Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
<s> No.  I don't think so.
<s> Uh, huh...She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis.  She wanted to know all about Billy.
<s> Uh, huh...Yeah...
<s> What?
<s> Uh, huh...
<s> Ted, I just heard...
<s> Ha!  You tell me.
<s> Yes, Holiness.
<s> Cow.
<s> Will you buy the sheep for me?
<s> It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
<s> General Chiang.
<s> We did not.
<s> At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
<s> I am him.
<s> Roughly five thousand men.
<s> Ask whatever you will.
<s> Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
<s> I had relinquished doubt.
<s> A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
<s> But you will always be here?
<s> Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
<s> Is that true or pretend?
<s> But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
<s> The Chinese.
<s> The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
<s> Eliminate you.
<s> Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
<s> I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.
<s> We cannot.
<s> It is possible, Holiness.
<s> It is a difficult situation.
<s> Oh yes.  I killed him.
<s> No.  Do you?
<s> It happens when I land.
<s> I need to see his habitat.
<s> If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
<s> You're crawling around like a--
<s> They don't really attack underwater and--
<s> Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
<s> It came from across the lake.
<s> Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
<s> Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.
<s> We both know what they'll do.
<s> You do?
<s> Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
<s> Thank you, Jack.
<s> That hurt my feelings.
<s> 'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
<s> What's going on?
<s> <u>Nothing's</u> real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--
<s> So I don't like tents, why--
<s> There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
<s> I'm sorry but you're...
<s> I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
<s> Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
<s> We seem to say goodnight a lot.
<s> <u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
<s> Keep firing!
<s> I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
<s> Did he say anything?
<s> Well.  At wakes.
<s> You threw it at me!!
<s> He said he knew Karate!
<s> Absolutely.
<s> I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
<s> Kevin told me you were upset.
<s> It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
<s> Backstabber?
<s> Liar?
<s> Where?
<s> Sometimes.
<s> I don't know! Get me out!!
<s> Okay, Mr. Yow...
<s> Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
<s> Murdered...? How?
<s> I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
<s> He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
<s> What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
<s> All that detail, just from memory...?
<s> No, no, no. You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. It won't do. It's stupid and boring.
<s> If you didn't kill him, then who did?
<s> Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
<s> Who killed your patient?
<s> That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
<s> I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
<s> A cattle ranch?
<s> The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
<s> Yes, Doctor. Please.
<s> Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
<s> Yes...
<s> That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture.
<s> Can we rest soon?
<s> Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
<s> Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
<s> Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
<s> Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
<s> You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
<s> Dark haired...
<s> No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
<s> Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
<s> Do not let gratitude get in the way...
<s> What else?
<s> It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.
<s> And what is that?
<s> Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
<s> Fire!!!
<s> Yes sir!
<s> Fire!
<s> "Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
<s> Heart. Give Magua new heart.
<s> Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
<s> Granted.
<s> La victoire.
<s> Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
<s> He did.
<s> And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
<s> No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
<s> Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
<s> Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
<s> Shit...
<s> All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow--
<s> There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
<s> Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.
<s> Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of---
<s> What's your air reading?
<s> Roger.
<s> Ahhhh!
<s> And it killed Bo?
<s> Beautiful.
<s> It shouldn't be a long delay.
<s> Timex...
<s> Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's hear it for our shop Steward!
<s> This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
<s> 'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
<s> Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
<s> I ought to smack your face!
<s> DeJesus...It's got him.
<s> Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?
<s> Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
<s> The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on.
<s> I still will, if you don't mind.
<s> I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
<s> You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.
<s> Like antiques.
<s> If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.
<s> There were two old guns there; where are they?
<s> Fucking Northern monkeys.
<s> I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
<s> Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
<s> You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
<s> This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
<s> What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
<s> The stupid bastards! Count it!
<s> Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
<s> If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.
<s> It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.
<s> Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.
<s> I'll only be a minute.
<s> I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
<s> Doesn't sound very good to me.
<s> I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
<s> Get your fingers out of my soup!
<s> I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
<s> Twelve.
<s> You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
<s> They stole our land--
<s> I'm sorry, sir.
<s> From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
<s> He'll live.
<s> He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--
<s> If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
<s> We were just dancing--
<s> We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.
<s> That's in Maverick County.
<s> Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
<s> Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
<s> --and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
<s> --they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.
<s> But they were Indians themselves.
<s> Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
<s> No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
<s> Dad--
<s> He does.
<s> Made some money, came back here--
<s> You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
<s> Lead mine.
<s> Seriously, I think we should get married.
<s> This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
<s> If the next guy's a redneck.
<s> --but just as a kind of safety tip.
<s> I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
<s> The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
<s> I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
<s> You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
<s> Aqui! [Here!]
<s> Quien es? [Who is it?]
<s> They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
<s> You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
<s> Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
<s> Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
<s> King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
<s> That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
<s> Hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
<s> That Buddy was a cool breeze.
<s> Seems like we have another one every week.
<s> When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
<s> Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd.
<s> Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
<s> And I understand why you might want to think he could.
<s> We have a murder?
<s> Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
<s> Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
<s> Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
<s> No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
<s> You ever play one of these?
<s> Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
<s> Okay? He's not here?
<s> He's going to wish he was dead.
<s> And when my father was Sheriff?
<s> What do you think?
<s> Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
<s> I'm surprised he bothered with it.
<s> So I've heard--
<s> He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
<s> Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
<s> So she tells me three times a week.
<s> Pilar--
<s> Yeah.
<s> You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
<s> The shooter local?
<s> Don't know if I'll still want it.
<s> I appreciate you telling me.
<s> Just doing my job.
<s> You telling me what to do, Roderick?
<s> Yeah. It's quiet--
<s> You think he killed anybody in Korea?
<s> You know who it was?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Runnin' numbers illegal.
<s> Yeah.  It's French.
<s> Nix?
<s> Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
<s> Not yet.
<s> Yes...
<s> I don't know where you'd start.
<s> They won't tell you anything.
<s> I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
<s> No.
<s> I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
<s> It's all right.  It's not hurting...
<s> Hang on!
<s> Yes.
<s> I... have... to.
<s> Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
<s> I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
<s> I heard he was the best.
<s> I'm here to offer you a job.
<s> Are you a gambling man?
<s> I don't think the dead much care.
<s> Are you a believer, then?
<s> You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
<s> What for?  You need to stay busy?
<s> Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
<s> Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
<s> A Mister Quaid?
<s> For what?
<s> Well... nobody.
<s> You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
<s> Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
<s> Will that do?  No?
<s> Didn't know you read minds.
<s> There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
<s> Is he the Puritan?
<s> Binding you.
<s> You'll do it?
<s> My wife needs space, I don't know my kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so I'm here doing a whiskey commercial.
<s> Ok.
<s> I know. I don't either.
<s> It's Charlotte.
<s> I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
<s> No, yes, it does...
<s> Because that would be too easy.
<s> Working.
<s> Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Hello, Bob, it's me.
<s> Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
<s> Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
<s> Do you want I send it to your room?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Why do you have to defend her?
<s> I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
<s> Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
<s> We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
<s> She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
<s> I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
<s> Claire...
<s> What time did you make it for?
<s> And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
<s> I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
<s> You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
<s> You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
<s> It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
<s> Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
<s> I had to.  There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.
<s> I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
<s> Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
<s> Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
<s> You just call?
<s> I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
<s> I had to.
<s> I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
<s> You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
<s> What's the...OH SHIT!
<s> Your 33rd birthday.  The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead.  Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books.
<s> What did he say to you in French?
<s> We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
<s> Look, John, I'm facing it.
<s> Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
<s> Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
<s> He's looking right at me.
<s> How're you doin' today?
<s> I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
<s> Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
<s> You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
<s> So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
<s> Sort of.
<s> Then I'll get you some punch.
<s> Yes, we appreciate that.
<s> What?
<s> To do what you love.
<s> Always on my ass, anyway.
<s> No one's forcing her.
<s> Oh, great.
<s> What?
<s> Chances are there's still a chance.
<s> She hates all freshmen.
<s> Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
<s> Just wanted to say good game.
<s> But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
<s> Lucky.
<s> I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
<s> I just can.
<s> One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
<s> For how long?
<s> So that means I have to ride with you.
<s> Guess "please" would be a stretch.
<s> With a jacked-up attitude.
<s> You either.
<s> Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
<s> I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
<s> Right here.
<s> You're not stupid.
<s> I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
<s> I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> We won the championship.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
<s> you woke me up to tell me that?
<s> Then why are you so upset?
<s> So you're gonna bitch up?
<s> We still have to go?
<s> I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
<s> Tell me what?
<s> I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
<s> Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
<s> I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces.
<s> I don't know.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Alright, so I'm gonna transfer you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do --
<s> LAPD. Open the door.
<s> I'm coming!
<s> Who was it?
<s> Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
<s> You and your boyfriend have a party last night?
<s> Okey-doke.
<s> What's that stand for?
<s> No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
<s> Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
<s> Wanna kiss me, Jim?
<s> Yes.
<s> Diet Coke.
<s> I should maybe go to the bathroom.
<s> Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
<s> Put the gun down, please, boy.
<s> Son, please, now....
<s> I think it's more complicated than that little man.
<s> Alright, alright, cut it, coolio. That's enough with the mouth and the language.
<s> What happend?
<s> Yeah, I'm here, I'm off the elevator, walking down the hall, now --
<s> A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
<s> Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
<s> Might of been before my time.
<s> -- Samuel Johnson.
<s> Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
<s> You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
<s> Yes I do.
<s> Don't do this, Don.
<s> You were gonna ask me weren't you?
<s> Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
<s> If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
<s> Do you wanna sit down?
<s> You do?
<s> Where is he?
<s> No.
<s> She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
<s> Who are you gonna call?
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> Twelve.
<s> Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
<s> Let's talk about --
<s> -- let's talk more about your background --
<s> Is that still lingering?
<s> Yes.
<s> In aid of what?
<s> I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
<s> An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
<s> And that's what you've heard?
<s> -- fuck you.
<s> Around here.
<s> Well I guess it doesn't.
<s> Not a problem.
<s> I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
<s> For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
<s> Yeah.
<s> OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
<s> Ok. What's your name?
<s> Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
<s> Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
<s> I went out last night.
<s> It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
<s> I didn't hear anything.
<s> It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
<s> I'm drinking.
<s> I'm a bad person.
<s> Do you have any children with anyone?
<s> Do you feel better now that you've said this?
<s> I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
<s> I really don't know.
<s> <u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
<s> Are you her boyfriend?
<s> -- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
<s> The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
<s> -- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
<s> Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
<s> Um, no, y'know what? Forget the water, just give me a loaf of bread...white bread.
<s> Ok. One of those. Do you have Ram Rod? The magazine, Ram Rod?
<s> That's it.
<s> Yes. What? Yes.
<s> I gotta go to the bathroom.
<s> I need this one.
<s> Should be one-thirty.
<s> I'm fine. nothing.
<s> I didn't know the answer --
<s> I don't know.
<s> I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
<s> I understand you saved my son's life today.
<s> And you were not hurt?
<s> Nothing... Nothing.
<s> Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
<s> I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
<s> My guards are useless!  Take her from me!
<s> You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own.
<s> Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
<s> He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
<s> Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
<s> Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
<s> I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
<s> So what has changed?
<s> They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
<s> Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
<s> Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
<s> Catacombs.  Very holy.
<s> No, not Louis!
<s> Who does?
<s> You are right.  But it is a trap.
<s> Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
<s> Get out of my way.
<s> The King killed my son!
<s> Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
<s> It is something I have done -- or did not do.
<s> What is it, d'Artagnan?  Assassins falling from the sky now?
<s> I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
<s> In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love.
<s> Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
<s> It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
<s> There.
<s> I must insist, Sire.
<s> No, Keeper.
<s> Eh?
<s> No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
<s> Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
<s> Out directing the search for the traitors.
<s> Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.
<s> That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
<s> A letter.  May I see?
<s> Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
<s> Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
<s> But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
<s> Did he harm the girl?
<s> Could explain why Fleming was there.
<s> What happened with the tape?
<s> So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
<s> Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
<s> Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
<s> They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
<s> Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
<s> Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
<s> He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
<s> You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
<s> His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
<s> Could he handle a direct contact?
<s> Christ!
<s> Library of Congress.
<s> Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
<s> Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
<s> No.
<s> I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
<s> You said the guy down here is good.
<s> You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
<s> Why?
<s> See? You do know something about him.
<s> After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
<s> What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
<s> When I'm done.
<s> VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
<s> Wait for the back-up! Will?
<s> Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
<s> In eight days.
<s> No, thanks. I manage very well.  I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.
<s> They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
<s> The Tooth...
<s> Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
<s> No. I don't want to see you.
<s> Oh, God.
<s> God, no.
<s> No.
<s> Atlanta and Birmingham.
<s> That's true.
<s> Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
<s> Goodbye.
<s> Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
<s> I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
<s> We have it good, don't we?
<s> What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
<s> Hey, baby! Where are you?
<s> I love you...
<s> Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
<s> Will...
<s> Will? Are you okay?
<s> Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
<s> Go on to the house...
<s> Yes.
<s> We don't know that.
<s> ...yes.
<s> No.
<s> You've read the transcript. It's all there.
<s> I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
<s> I haven't decided yet.
<s> I hope you have a second chance...
<s> And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
<s> I refuse.
<s> Those are my terms.
<s> He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.
<s> Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
<s> Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!
<s> But wasn't it funny?
<s> You're BLIND!  There is no envelope anymore!!  It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution --  I don't want you two to ever work together again.
<s> Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
<s> So who's gonna pay for it?
<s> You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
<s> But it's only for thirty seconds!
<s> Twenty!
<s> No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
<s> Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
<s> Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
<s> Yes, your Holiness?
<s> He said he's coming back!
<s> What's your name?
<s> See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about!  Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!
<s> Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
<s> It's already begun.
<s> Oh, God.
<s> Yeah, 'course I'm sure.
<s> Don't tell me you're a believer now?
<s> My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
<s> I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
<s> How do you know all this?
<s> There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.
<s> The agents --
<s> You've never used them before.
<s> More important than what is when?
<s> I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
<s> I'm trying to free your mind, Neo, but all I can do is show you the door.  You're the one that has to step through.  Tank, load the jump program.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What's going on?
<s> She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
<s> That I would find the One.
<s> That's why we're here.
<s> Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
<s> What do you mean, without him?
<s> How do you know that name?
<s> What is the Matrix?
<s> Yes.
<s> Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?
<s> I don't know.  It just went dead.
<s> I'm coming with you.
<s> No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
<s> Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
<s> The last human city.  The only place we got left.
<s> Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.
<s> Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!
<s> Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
<s> Thanks.
<s> You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
<s> Anybody wanna have a game?
<s> Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
<s> So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
<s> Yeah.
<s> The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
<s> I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
<s> Wouldn't bother me.
<s> Didn't show up.
<s> Did you see them run!
<s> You tell me that in front of these creeps?
<s> I'll be here.  Don't worry.
<s> What pipes?
<s> Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
<s> I don't understand, where's Groppi?
<s> 'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
<s> Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
<s> What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
<s> All right.
<s> What was it?
<s> Wha?
<s> Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
<s> You're intolerable today.
<s> Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
<s> Ok guys...have a heart.  This is my business.
<s> Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
<s> You ate?
<s> Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
<s> Hi, Allison --
<s> Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
<s> It's for the party, Dad --
<s> No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
<s> But what?
<s> -- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
<s> I'm sorry, I don't recall --
<s> What 'business'?
<s> Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
<s> Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
<s> Then why did you bring it up?
<s> But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
<s> No no, not you.
<s> Me, too.
<s> What?!
<s> Uh -- he's from out of town --
<s> I get the feeling you've done some business before.
<s> I am now.
<s> Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
<s> Yours.
<s> Certainly.  Goodnight.
<s> So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
<s> Certainly, Bill.
<s> Yeah.  Neat.
<s> Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex' place.
<s> Rass!
<s> Sure.
<s> No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
<s> I'm lost.
<s> I haven't.
<s> Do you love Drew?
<s> I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
<s> Then why are you here, Joe?
<s> Patients have visitors, not doctors.
<s> It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
<s> Yes.  I'm tired.
<s> Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
<s> Oh, I hope a long, long time.
<s> It gets worse.
<s> I love you now, I'll love you always --
<s> Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
<s> Thank you.
<s> No.
<s> Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
<s> I won't.
<s> Yes, Bill.
<s> Can you keep a secret?
<s> So can I.
<s> Of course.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> Just a manner of speaking.
<s> I'm her father!
<s> What are you saying, that it's time to go?
<s> Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
<s> With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
<s> I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.
<s> It's time to put this person where he belongs.
<s> There's going to be plenty of time for that.
<s> I think you know --
<s> What the hell is this?  Who are you?
<s> It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
<s> Time.
<s> Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
<s> Hi, honey.
<s> He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
<s> So what's wrong with that?
<s> Don't get dirty, Dad --
<s> Bravo.
<s> You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
<s> A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
<s> We've met.
<s> Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
<s> Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> You and 'Honey'?
<s> And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
<s> You never know.  Lightning could strike.
<s> Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
<s> Just loud enough to wake me up.
<s> Seen you together, that's all.
<s> What?
<s> Then why is this my handwriting?
<s> Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
<s> A cop?
<s> * I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
<s> Interested in buying one?
<s> Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
<s> No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
<s> Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
<s> Did you?
<s> There are things you know for sure.
<s> What happened?
<s> They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
<s> This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
<s> No!
<s> Kill him. I'll pay you.
<s> * John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *
<s> Thanks.
<s> You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
<s> Thank you.
<s> I'll be waiting.							   *
<s> So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
<s> He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
<s> You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
<s> No! Should I?
<s> Teddy. Your buddy.
<s> From who?
<s> The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
<s> No. You took them out.						  *
<s> There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...
<s> They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
<s> You said Nazi Low-riders...?
<s> I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
<s> Okay.  You got the "item"?
<s> I'm a fiend for mojitas.
<s> You do business in Cuba with your husband?
<s> No.
<s> Died in childbirth, having me...
<s> I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
<s> I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
<s> And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
<s> Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
<s> This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
<s> I know.  And now?
<s> Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?
<s> "Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
<s> Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
<s> On my way back...
<s> We're makin' moves on each other.
<s> To recruit you.
<s> Hi, Gina.  This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy?
<s> How will it stand up?
<s> How do I know?  But it was from the get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me into them.  Sonny, I gotta go...!
<s> Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
<s> ...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
<s> We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
<s> But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
<s> He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...
<s> ...and thanks for the flowers.
<s> What's it say?
<s> Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
<s> Jos doesn't like the deal in South Florida...
<s> A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
<s> Define small.
<s> You're hoping to get a look at what?
<s> Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
<s> Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
<s> Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
<s> Y -- what in hell starts with Y?
<s> You gonna beat me, Joe?
<s> Now take it. Go on.  Listen, where can I reach you? Cause I'm gonna make this right with you soon's I get me set up...
<s> Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
<s> You talk like a man with a tin twat.
<s> Yeah, well, so?
<s> What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.
<s> No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
<s> I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
<s> They gotta be.
<s> I'm wet.
<s> What?
<s> Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought. You shouldn't have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait here...
<s> No. You got it.
<s> Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
<s> ... and taxi fare for me.
<s> Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on, let me show you the tennis courts.
<s> ...He had a bald skull and...
<s> Nah, just covered with batshit!
<s> Everything.
<s> The Hilton.
<s> Well, it's an interesting place...  Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet.
<s> Sure.
<s> I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
<s> Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
<s> ...She was on the plane.
<s> Lucky girl.
<s> I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
<s> Then I'll cut his balls off.
<s> Oh shit.
<s> Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
<s> Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.

<s> Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
<s> I'll be late.
<s> I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
<s> Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
<s> So?
<s> Susan, we're not b-
<s> How?!
<s> That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
<s> I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
<s> I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
<s> Sure.
<s> --my number one fan.
<s> Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
<s> It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe... 
<s> If you wouldn't mind.
<s> I don't have a title yet.
<s> It has no nobility.
<s> Then the roads are open...
<s> I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
<s> Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
<s> You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
<s> My pleasure.
<s> The Sistine Chapel?
<s> I DIDN'T...
<s> I don't know.
<s> Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
<s> It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
<s> They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
<s> I can't write this anymore.
<s> Have to wait.
<s> Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row?
<s> To Misery.
<s> I think you're right.
<s> Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
<s> But the time is now. Soon others will come.
<s> I'm almost done.
<s> Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
<s> Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.
<s> What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
<s> That's nice.
<s> Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
<s> I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
<s> Here it is.  Very first copy.
<s> Now you've hurt me, Paul.
<s> Mmmm.
<s> What else?
<s> Well, that's good, isn't?
<s> Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
<s> Sit down.  You'll be a billionaire.  Better than being broke.  I've got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies standing in line.  Ball's in your court, Mr. McCloy.
<s> Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.
<s> And you're happy about that?
<s> Ninety-three point four million.
<s> ..or hard wired..
<s> Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
<s> What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?
<s> I am. She is.
<s> No.  Just as if I'd like to.
<s> Uh-huh?
<s> Do what?
<s> You didn't do that badly.
<s> Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
<s> You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
<s> Five, six-hundred thousand.
<s> Sean Ambrose, for one.
<s> Just about..
<s> - Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
<s> Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
<s> You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?
<s> Oh Ethan!..
<s> I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
<s> I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
<s> Like?
<s> Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
<s> Twice.
<s> You mean it'll be difficult.
<s> Well it's not mission <i>difficult,</i> Hunt. It's mission <i>impossible.</i>  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.  If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.
<s> We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
<s> Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
<s> Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
<s> By fire.  That's the best way, really.
<s> Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
<s> Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
<s> Nyah, Ambrose is heading back.  There's an enveloped inside --
<s> Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
<s> Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
<s> Good job.  And thanks.
<s> Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
<s> Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
<s> Who is "they?"
<s> I sent the message to Max.  Were on for tomorrow.
<s> My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- dont know
<s> Location green.  One hour.  Ill be there myself.
<s> Yeah.
<s> This whole operation was a molehunt.
<s> Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.
<s> Profitable.
<s> Now I want you to hold onto it.
<s> Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
<s> Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first.
<s> Give me a break, Pops.
<s> Roger that.  Opening doors now.
<s> Jim.  Jim.  Hes in the open.
<s> If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
<s> I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
<s> When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
<s> Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
<s> Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
<s> - and picked us up in the States -
<s> Youre wrong about one thing.  Im not the only one whos seen you alive.
<s> Jack you're so wicked.
<s> Connection denied.
<s> Its not working.
<s> I always check the batteries.
<s> Phew!  Weve got five minutes...
<s> Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
<s> Again?
<s> Let's go tell your Mother.
<s> I like your dress.  It's very bright.
<s> You have too many dogs.
<s> You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
<s> He's in Palermo.
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Instantaneous.
<s> Just Johnny.
<s> What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
<s> I'm telling you your life!
<s> No!
<s> Where are you taking me?
<s> You ruined my life.
<s> I'll come to the wedding.
<s> But he wants me to come!
<s> Marc Chagall. A Russian.
<s> Come on.
<s> No.
<s> Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
<s> Is Johnny here?
<s> Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 
<s> What!
<s> No?
<s> Maybe you're right.
<s> My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
<s> Alright.
<s> I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
<s> Everything's different.
<s> Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
<s> That's a pretty big sin.
<s> If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.
<s> It's late.
<s> You're kidding?
<s> You don't know where Loretta is?
<s> You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
<s> Sure!
<s> What do you do?
<s> Don't shit where you eat.
<s> I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
<s> I think it's because they fear death.
<s> Well. That explains it.
<s> Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
<s> WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
<s> Did you dress her up like this?
<s> Yes!
<s> Please!
<s> He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
<s> I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
<s> What!  Just a flesh wound. 
<s> Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
<s> Shut up, will you. Shut up!
<s> Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
<s> I'm not dead!
<s> What is your quest?
<s> Here's one!
<s> I can't take him.
<s> Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
<s> Oh ... that's awfully nice.
<s> But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
<s> I'm ... your son ...
<s> Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
<s> No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
<s> Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
<s> I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
<s> Camelot ...
<s> Did I tell you?  Did you listen to me?  Oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  The names you called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
<s> No, no, no.
<s> You know what I mean.
<s> There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
<s> But I'm the only one she trusts.
<s> She'll be worried about me.
<s> I can't let her down now, Archie.
<s> You watch your tongue.
<s> What do you take me for?
<s> Kitchen and lower house.
<s> Yeah, yeah, I did.
<s> Of course.
<s> Are you deaf as well as stupid?
<s> Whom you address.
<s> ... Least of all my son.  It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.
<s> My own.
<s> That's a tautology lad.  If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally.  That's understood.
<s> We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even you.
<s> I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard.  In the event of any disturbance I will ensure --
<s> Occasionally.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> It's nothing.
<s> This is the top.
<s> What I do, I do for my Queen.
<s> The greasy pole.
<s> I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
<s> To keep out the cold.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> Then why send me back to them?!
<s> Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
<s> The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
<s> So?
<s> No, she wasn't.
<s> Of course.
<s> Why?
<s> Your Majesty --
<s> From whom?
<s> You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
<s> It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard down.  Keeps on changing the rules.
<s> Yeah, who isn't.
<s> How do you do that?
<s> Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right?
<s> What the hell are you talking about?
<s> We are talking...
<s> How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
<s> No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
<s> It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
<s> We can't...
<s> My house.  I want to try something.
<s> And beat it at it's own game.
<s> Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
<s> Yeah, that's what worries me.
<s> Screamer.
<s> Hold my keys, then.
<s> Yes...
<s> That way.
<s> In this world, wrong is right!
<s> Is that your question?
<s> I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...
<s> Not yet, honey...
<s> The game will guide you.
<s> The Air-Force is working on the same thing.
<s> I'm going home.
<s> The Cowboy??
<s> Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
<s> I'll speak to someone.
<s> Okay, I'm thinking.
<s> Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
<s> One.
<s> Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
<s> You got it! See you later honey.
<s> His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
<s> Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
<s> Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
<s> Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
<s> But you won't.
<s> May I have your name please?
<s> But it said #12.
<s> We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
<s> Come on... let's find you something to wear.
<s> "My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
<s> "Then they'd put you in jail."
<s> This Denny's.
<s> To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
<s> No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
<s> Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
<s> We have to climb up that.
<s> NO ! I wouldn't do that.
<s> I'm listening.
<s> But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
<s> Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
<s> I've since changed my mind. I designed this place, based on my belief that I was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do. McCay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. It's a tax write off. On the books everything looks kosher. I have an office on 5th that I haven't seen in ten years.
<s> The Brooklyn Bridge.
<s> I work here, remember ?
<s> 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
<s> Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go.
<s> I don't help criminals.
<s> I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.
<s> Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
<s> Yes, sir Mom. 
<s> You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
<s> Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
<s> For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
<s> Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
<s> What do you mean sir ?
<s> Sir ?
<s> Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
<s> I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
<s> He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
<s> I'll see that bet.
<s> I think I'll see hat action.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yahoo !!!!!
<s> I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
<s> UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
<s> I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
<s> Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
<s> I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
<s> She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
<s> Totally groovy huh?
<s> Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.
<s> Oh.  Ohhh?
<s> I'll try.
<s> Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
<s> Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
<s> It's just a corpse.
<s> He likes you.
<s> Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.
<s> What ever happened to a good old-fashioned favor huh?
<s> TAXI!!!
<s> Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
<s> What difference does it make?
<s> Change my name.
<s> Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
<s> May I use the phone please.
<s> Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
<s> Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
<s> I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
<s> Big deal.
<s> Good. I mean...
<s> I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
<s> You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
<s> Was Rose.
<s> You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.
<s> Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
<s> This is it I guess.
<s> You want me to come with?
<s> Phil for God sake.
<s> Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
<s> Is that a yes?
<s> What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.
<s> Bye Niece, Vada.
<s> I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
<s> Sort of?
<s> Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
<s> Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
<s> But Dad'll never go for it.
<s> You have no idea.
<s> He is?
<s> This guy bonking you?
<s> I think it's still available.
<s> Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
<s> That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
<s> I'm sure she will.
<s> Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
<s> Okay.
<s> I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
<s> What happened to her?
<s> See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
<s> Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
<s> Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
<s> Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
<s> That's a lot of money for a little girl.
<s> Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
<s> Can I go too?
<s> He was allergic to bees.
<s> Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
<s> Nothing, I'm dressing.
<s> Are you sure about all this?
<s> Hi, is Vada home?
<s> Cool, can I get one for Vada?
<s> Do you think she is?
<s> Why do you think she says that?
<s> Yes it is.
<s> I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
<s> My ball, I lost my ball.
<s> Can we look around in your camper?
<s> Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
<s> No, I'm divorced.
<s> Can I use your bathroom first?
<s> A girl's always gotta look her best.
<s> Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
<s> Liverpool?
<s> What are you saving for?
<s> Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
<s> It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
<s> Hey, where does it say that?
<s> It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
<s> What?
<s> But, I don't know how.
<s> Well, let's spit on it.
<s> Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
<s> I honestly wish I could...
<s> The wandering sportswriter.
<s> Kindred spirits.
<s> Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
<s> Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
<s> You have a real philosophy of life.
<s> Go figure you.
<s> That was Thursday.
<s> It's too late to start over.
<s> And what will he do?
<s> You need a few dollars.
<s> Which was the disqualifying factor?
<s> ... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
<s> Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
<s> Exactly.
<s> It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
<s> I need you.
<s> What's next?
<s> Endearingly absent-minded.
<s> She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
<s> Till the gas ran out.
<s> What, leaving school...
<s> She would never.  Never.  Even think of that.
<s> I got the point.
<s> That would be a girl.  I don't even know.
<s> Boy, those were the days.
<s> The night we met.
<s> ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
<s> It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.
<s> You're right.  Easy come, easy go.
<s> "Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
<s> A bad combination.
<s> She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
<s> BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.
<s> She admits it's her fault.
<s> Lower.
<s> The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
<s> I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
<s> Hi! Star.
<s> Don't feel that way, honey.
<s> What?
<s> Okay. Thanks.
<s> Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
<s> They can come to the concert in the park.
<s> A little slow, but she'll be fine.
<s> Okay.
<s> Hi. Come on in. Mary!
<s> Minimum.
<s> Sure thing.
<s> Sue was trying to get hold of you.
<s> It's the den mother.
<s> Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
<s> How in the world did he get shot?
<s> Hi, Sherry.
<s> I'm not really a musician.
<s> Suits me.
<s> A little. What do you need?
<s> I'1l get your bag.
<s> Replacement party.
<s> I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
<s> I don't really know what you're talking about.
<s> No.
<s> No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
<s> Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.
<s> But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
<s> No, I don't.
<s> I've got a gig tonight.
<s> I have to go.
<s> I can't.
<s> Oh.
<s> Yea.
<s> You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
<s> What!
<s> Oh?
<s> How long have you been together?
<s> Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
<s> Why?
<s> What?
<s> We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
<s> You do?
<s> You bet.
<s> Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
<s> Sure thing.
<s> I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
<s> May I see your costume?
<s> I see.
<s> Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.
<s> Yes, I would.
<s> Yes, you are.
<s> Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it.
<s> Don't stop!
<s> I see.
<s> I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.
<s> Okay, Wayne, step forward.
<s> There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
<s> Whose ratings were higher?
<s> How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
<s> She sings? What does she sing?
<s> Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
<s> Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?
<s> You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
<s> It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
<s> Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
<s> I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
<s> You made every day like kindergarten.
<s> Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
<s> They've hypnotized the nation.
<s> I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
<s> Next week's episode.
<s> Wayne---
<s> Wayne Gayle.
<s> Perfecto!
<s> Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!
<s> They're mesmerising.
<s> But you'll never be whole again.
<s> Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
<s> Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
<s> Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
<s> You in a big hurry, boy?
<s> Don't start no trouble, boy!
<s> Where was that?
<s> Okay.
<s> I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
<s> Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
<s> Yeah. On the section gang.
<s> What d'you expect?
<s> You don't think much of yourself, do you?
<s> I like a place with lots of life.
<s> Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
<s> Well, I don't get on so well most places.
<s> Don't Duff--
<s> Take it easy.
<s> You almost got into trouble back there.
<s> Oh yeah, and then what?
<s> That's the way he is.
<s> No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
<s> Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
<s> Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
<s> Don't call them that.
<s> He could live with us.
<s> They won't.
<s> What the hell could you do?
<s> Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
<s> When I get set, I'll send for you.
<s> Duff--
<s> Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
<s> 'Got a good thing, man.
<s> 'Bye, Jocko.
<s> Who're you?
<s> What's on your mind?
<s> What's the matter? Don't smell so good, huh? Must'a broken some records.
<s> Sorry.
<s> He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
<s> I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
<s> How are you?
<s> Thank you.
<s> I doubt it.
<s> It ain't in me.
<s> It's for your own good.
<s> Hi.
<s> Okay, boy, beat it.
<s> I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
<s> No. I only needed the code from you.
<s> My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
<s> Straylight. Kitchen dock.
<s> You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
<s> My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
<s> We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
<s> Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
<s> Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
<s> What about McCoy?
<s> Prepping your trip.
<s> You'll be linked during the entire operation.
<s> Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.
<s> Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> You're pleasant tonight.
<s> Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
<s> I an' I, man. I an' I.
<s> So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
<s> You can make your move when it comes after me.
<s> I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
<s> Case.
<s> I thought you already left.
<s> ... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
<s> For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
<s> Couple of days. They'll examine you.
<s> Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
<s> Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
<s> Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
<s> I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
<s> guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
<s> Nice.
<s> Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> YOU KNIT?
<s> Nope.
<s> Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
<s> If you say so.
<s> Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
<s> Anita, remember espadrilles?
<s> Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
<s> Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
<s> But I don't want it straightened out.
<s> Kristen got a quote?
<s> I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
<s> Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
<s> See!
<s> I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
<s> Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
<s> Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
<s> Is that true?
<s> No. Josie, this is real.
<s> I know.
<s> Oh I don't think so.
<s> College. Haven't really thought about it.
<s> Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
<s> I don't have to say that.
<s> When are you going to open your eyes?
<s> But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
<s> Oh--yikes!
<s> Thank you.  I'm Rob.
<s> I can't help it.
<s> I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
<s> <i>                      Now and forever...</i>
<s> I wasn't sure, Ken...
<s> He's dead, you bitch.
<s> What about it?
<s> You got a problem with me, Grady?
<s> Yeah, why?
<s> I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
<s> Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room?  Fred Krueger worked here.  It's an old power- plant - a steam generator!
<s> What's this?
<s> I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.
<s> Ghostbusters are fearless.
<s> Whoa!
<s> I don't know - a sharp pain.
<s> I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
<s> he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
<s> No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
<s> Hi.
<s> We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
<s> Okay...thanks.
<s> Thanks, Mom.
<s> They're healing up nicely.
<s> Don't hold your breath.
<s> YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!  KRUEGER!
<s> Sure.
<s> He's heavy in the halls...
<s> He's too strong!  He was never this strong!
<s> They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
<s> Can't be good news coming from you.
<s> So?
<s> Thanks, Max.
<s> But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.
<s> Nancy...
<s> So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
<s> Never been here before?
<s> Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
<s> Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
<s> I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.
<s> Doesn't matter.
<s> All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
<s> Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
<s> Your dreams?
<s> And what are they?
<s> I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
<s> I won't allow it.
<s> Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
<s> Uh, fourteen.
<s> This is stupid.
<s> Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
<s> Now you're lying.
<s> We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
<s> I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
<s> Films mainly.
<s> You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
<s> Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
<s> Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
<s> You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
<s> Oh -- Okay.
<s> Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
<s> Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
<s> Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
<s> There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
<s> She saw through me.
<s> No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
<s> No, you were brilliant
<s> You think I should do Henry James instead?
<s> Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
<s> Yes.  Always have had.
<s> What?
<s> You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
<s> Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
<s> I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
<s> That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
<s> Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
<s> Thank you.  Shall I...
<s> Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
<s> And what would you say...
<s> That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
<s> I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
<s> What's your name?
<s> Anna Scott?
<s> Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course...  I was total crap.
<s> Right. 
<s> What?
<s> Shame!
<s> Well, yes.  Groovy.
<s> And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
<s> What's your name?
<s> Any bit in particular?
<s> But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
<s> Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
<s> May I help you, sir?
<s> Point taken.
<s> Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
<s> It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
<s> No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
<s> Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
<s> That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
<s> Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
<s> Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
<s> Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
<s> Fabulous.
<s> What?
<s> So?
<s> Yes, that is correct.
<s> I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
<s> I-I-I...
<s> You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
<s> No! No! No!
<s> Right!
<s> Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
<s> Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
<s> I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
<s> Yes, ma'am?
<s> Why, thank you, ma'am...  Whew. Man, I tell you, that place up there is somethin' else!  Well, ya boys been practicin' up for the big game?  I figured as much...
<s> Please see to Mister Bromden.
<s> H-H-Hearts.
<s> I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
<s> Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
<s> H-Hey, M-Mack.
<s> Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand...
<s> Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points...
<s> Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan...
<s> M-M-M-Mack?
<s> No.
<s> Ca-na-da...
<s> What? Where?
<s> Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.
<s> That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
<s> It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.
<s> Right, Mack!
<s> Yeah!
<s> What?
<s> Now, what would I be trying to say?
<s> That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do.
<s> Just warmin' up.
<s> Well, it doesn't hurt him either!  Does it, Chief!  See, it doesn't hurt him.  Jump! An' put it in!
<s> I refuse!
<s> No!
<s> Me. Hit me!
<s> Hold it a minute.
<s> Yeah, Mac?
<s> No! I wanna go!
<s> No. Me! Me!
<s> McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
<s> I see.
<s> Good. Good.
<s> Time out!
<s> Oh, yeah?
<s> How much ya wanna bet?
<s> You're on.  Let's go! An' keep it quiet.
<s> Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities...
<s> Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
<s> What?
<s> Tha's your problem.
<s> Now you talkin'.
<s> Yes, ma'am...
<s> Shhh... let's move it away from the window...
<s> Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
<s> It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
<s> Buona notte.
<s> Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
<s> No.
<s> Your hair... is perfect.
<s> Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
<s> If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.  And stop talking.  You're gonna ruin the spell.
<s> Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together.
<s> He's safe.
<s> So it wasn't real.
<s> Please.  I need to know.
<s> Mickey Spillane?
<s> Well, good.  Good for you.
<s> What?
<s> Hi.  Are you... busy?
<s> Are you asking me out?
<s> GET OUT!!
<s> No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
<s> There is no us.
<s> Tonight?
<s> Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
<s> Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
<s> What?
<s> No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
<s> So?...
<s> I don't know, Kate.
<s> He's a podiatrist or something.
<s> I know...  It was.
<s> I think he's having an affair.
<s> You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
<s> Only what?
<s> You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
<s> Her brother.
<s> Hi.  Where've you been?
<s> What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
<s> Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
<s> I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
<s> Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
<s> She didn't give me a chance.
<s> Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
<s> If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
<s> When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry Street in Dublin the nuns used to say to me, "Nolan, don't be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. When you got something to say  Talk with your mouth wide open," so if I'm loud don't blame me it's the fault of the nuns!
<s> The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
<s> I'm not thirsty.
<s> I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
<s> The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
<s> Boss loader!
<s> And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
<s> I wish I knew, Edie, But 
<s> Hello, Edie.
<s> None of your business.
<s> Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
<s> A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.
<s> Man, you were a mess!
<s> Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
<s> Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little  I better get you home.
<s> Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
<s> I don't know.
<s> The things that go on.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
<s> What for?
<s> I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt What more do you want?
<s> There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight.
<s> I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
<s> How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
<s> It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
<s> I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
<s> I mean it, let's get away from here, first Joey then Nolan, now Charley and any minute... .  ...I'm frightened I'm frightened.
<s> I'll find you a priest.
<s> Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
<s> Good luck.
<s> You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
<s> I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
<s> Such as what?
<s> I'm just resting my feet.
<s> I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncher hooks over 'n under   whop-whop!
<s> Oh me and my chum are just rolling in the stuff. We only work down here for a hobby, J.P. 
<s> Raise a hand to me and... .
<s> Gimme the names, I'll write 'em down in me little book.
<s> Easy. Easy, boy.
<s> Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
<s> You ratted on us, Terry.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I was only talkin' to her.
<s> I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
<s> Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you're a walkin' distillery.
<s> Keep Charley out of this.
<s> Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
<s> Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
<s> No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
<s> Where?
<s> It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!
<s> Be careful!
<s> Nothing is worth your life.
<s> Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
<s> Maybe so.
<s> She loved the bull ring and the matador.  She danced to their destruction. Now she dances to her own destruction.  Her dance is of skulls.
<s> Ahh, she will be yours.
<s> Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
<s> Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
<s> Aaarrrgggaahh.
<s> Aannnnaahhnn.
<s> Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
<s> He'd call every once in a while.
<s> Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
<s> He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.
<s> Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or Glenn?
<s> Who are you?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
<s> He knows where she lives?
<s> I'm a tourist.
<s> Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  Do you?
<s> Yeah, and I better call my sister.
<s> Jack --
<s> Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
<s> You'll have to ask him.
<s> What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
<s> Wait.  You not Adele?
<s> Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
<s> Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
<s> Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
<s> We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
<s> Wait, I know him --okay?
<s> That's right.
<s> Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
<s> The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
<s> I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
<s> You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
<s> Sure.
<s> You'd probably tell me.
<s> Shit...
<s> How do we do that?
<s> Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
<s> It's not a game.  Something you play.
<s> It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
<s> I called your room from downstairs.
<s> I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.
<s> I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
<s> Why are you mad?
<s> Pretend I'm somebody else.
<s> I see better with them on.
<s> How many?
<s> Oh, uh, right, thanks...
<s> You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
<s> No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
<s> Of course not.
<s> Islamic.
<s> Meaning time came, I left.
<s> That time?
<s> Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
<s> Glenn?
<s> It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
<s> You're not?
<s> How you know that?
<s> Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?
<s> You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
<s> Something better.  Open it.
<s> Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
<s> I'd like that.
<s> It's possible.  Why?
<s> He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
<s> I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
<s> Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
<s> Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
<s> Are those <i>my</i> suits?
<s> Where the fuck is Foley?
<s> White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.
<s> You mean hiding them?
<s> He was that good?
<s> Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!
<s> Where's that lizard?
<s> Well, you p-puked on his feet.
<s> Kill the bastards!
<s> Six P-40's.
<s> Home of the brave.
<s> Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
<s> I can't make it.
<s> Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
<s> We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
<s> He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
<s> Well...sure.
<s> How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
<s> Our doctor's gone too.
<s> You too, Lieutenant.
<s> You waited til tonight to tell me?
<s> Do one thing for me, before you go.
<s> So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
<s> God help them.
<s> The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
<s> Peggy Sue!
<s> That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
<s> Stag movies. Smokers.
<s> Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
<s> Peggy Sue!
<s> You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
<s> I can't. It's all too much.
<s> Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
<s> On what?
<s> Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
<s> Why do guys do such stupid things?
<s> Charlie...
<s> Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
<s> I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
<s> I call this the staccato. 
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> Refresh my memory.
<s> You're pretty charming when you want to be.
<s> Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
<s> What am I going to do with you?
<s> I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
<s> How'd you know about that?
<s> That's real big of you.
<s> Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
<s> How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
<s> What?
<s> I know.
<s> You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
<s> I'll just set it right here.
<s> She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
<s> What would that be, sir?
<s> Take a long walk on a short pier.
<s> He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.
<s> Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
<s> She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
<s> Mom, is there any coffee left?
<s> I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
<s> I think they're going to deregulate it.
<s> Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
<s> Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
<s> Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
<s> Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
<s> The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
<s> How do you feel?
<s> Sure, Mom.  Hello.
<s> I had a dream that Grandma died.
<s> I don't feel very festive.
<s> I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
<s> We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
<s> I'm just happy to see you.
<s> Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
<s> I don't know.
<s> How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
<s> Give me some credit, will you?
<s> Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
<s> Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
<s> I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
<s> I couldn't help it  I loved him.
<s> Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
<s> Wait! I'll go with you!
<s> --Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?
<s> How'd you know that?
<s> I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
<s> Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way.
<s> Sure.
<s> I'm going out, Dad!
<s> Just until he heals up?
<s> You never get over it.
<s> Yeah...
<s> I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.
<s> In a word, Bob...
<s> What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
<s> Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
<s> Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.
<s> He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
<s> You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
<s> I promise!
<s> Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
<s> Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
<s> The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
<s> No.
<s> Of course.
<s> More than your friend. Family.
<s> If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
<s> About my blood work?
<s> Sounds delightful.
<s> He's upset, he's sorry.
<s> One week old.
<s> Continue.
<s> We?
<s> Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
<s> Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
<s> I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
<s> One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.
<s> Let's find you a drink.
<s> Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
<s> Charles. Okay. Miller?
<s> Thanks.  Do you like opera?
<s> Want to hear my favorite aria?
<s> What kind of person is that?
<s> Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens.
<s> Yes. On my torso.
<s> I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
<s> One. Here, in front of my ear.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
<s> I'll withdraw.  You were aware, when you worked with Maria Torres, that she had AIDS, correct?
<s> Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
<s> Right.
<s> Get real.
<s> That's correct.
<s> We were satisfied.
<s> I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment.
<s> I might.
<s> You're in trouble.
<s> In a word, yes.
<s> Do I look gay to you? Relax.
<s> How many do you know?
<s> Duh...
<s> Great, Lisa. Thank you.
<s> Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
<s> Yes, we did.
<s> With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
<s> ... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?
<s> Charles...
<s> Lookit. Lookit!
<s> It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!
<s> Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
<s> Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
<s> Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
<s> Look deeper.
<s> You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now?
<s> Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
<s> You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
<s> I would try for them.
<s> Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
<s> I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
<s> During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
<s> We're just burnin' light here.
<s> I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
<s> Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
<s> -- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
<s> What, you're goin' off, too?
<s> You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
<s> So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility?
<s> And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>That's</u> how they train you! On a fucking simulator!
<s> One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
<s> We're all on the same hajj now.
<s> I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
<s> Listen to her? <u>Her</u>? When she was willing to sacrifice us all?
<s> I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
<s> Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
<s> Oh, so I'm disposable?
<s> We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
<s> Say that again.
<s> No. She's not.
<s> Not if I'm the one.
<s> Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
<s> What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
<s> You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
<s> Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
<s> Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
<s> Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
<s> Right now, if you like.
<s> No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
<s> Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
<s> And they fell out of the sky with you?
<s> None at all.
<s> That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
<s> Show this to the President.
<s> We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
<s> Okay.
<s> So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
<s> Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
<s> My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
<s> My name is Taylor.
<s> This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
<s> Mind your tongue, madame.
<s> Read it yourself.
<s> With one of them.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Okay.Up to the cave.
<s> Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
<s> You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
<s> Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
<s> Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
<s> He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
<s> How the hell did he get away?
<s> ...everybody gotta die sometime Red... Get back to your foxhole.
<s> Tricky bitch, reason you gimme dat turkey loaf is nobody else can eat that shit 'cept me so don't start your game playing with me Junior.
<s> De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
<s> Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.
<s> Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
<s> Then what do you suggest big shot?
<s> Yeah. How 'bout you?
<s> Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
<s> Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
<s> Barnes believes in what he's doing.
<s> Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
<s> Who gives a shit!
<s> Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
<s> I gotta didi man. Don't wanna miss that chopper. I'll send you a postcard. After I get me some. I'll send you some tapes too man. This new guy Jimi Hendrix man, whew... you okay Taylor? Just 'member take it easy now, don't think too much, don't be a fool, no such thing as a coward cause it don't mean nuthin. Jes keep on keepin' on. Okay my man...
<s> Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!  Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank.
<s> Found it. Growing in a garden.
<s> So he got a reduced and come over here. Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy. Three years he been here.
<s> Barnes took a bullet right there. At Ia Drang Valley...  And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that's BAAAD man. That's his high, baby. High on WAR!
<s> Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
<s> I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
<s> Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
<s> I really don't know.
<s> Very nice Mitchell turns.
<s> I haven't been invited.
<s> Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
<s> Just drunk enough.
<s> No, please.
<s> I see.
<s> I see.
<s> As I said before...
<s> I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
<s> Sure... but somebody always does..
<s> That's all there is.
<s> There wasn't any plane.
<s> Bad enough.
<s> Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
<s> No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
<s> How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
<s> Killaine...
<s> This must have cost a fortune.
<s> You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
<s> Killaine's wise to what?
<s> Frozen.
<s> That, and the fun of it.
<s> I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
<s> What your father did doesn't condemn you.
<s> Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
<s> Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
<s> They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?
<s> You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
<s> You were there when I last saw him.
<s> There isn't anything you can do.
<s> I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
<s> Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
<s> Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
<s> Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
<s> Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
<s> You're not English.
<s> I don't.
<s> That COULD BE TOLD.
<s> Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
<s> You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
<s> Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
<s> Oh.  That was just one of those idle questions.  One doesn't expect an answer.
<s> No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
<s> Floater?
<s> Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
<s> One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
<s> So the shell ought to have gone over?
<s> I'll know when I find it.
<s> Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
<s> Well.  What about it?
<s> If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
<s> A think wire---but very, very strong.  Let's get out of here.
<s> I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
<s> Warm water, no doubt.
<s> Positive?
<s> Sure.  You didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell.  If I believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
<s> You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning, Mrs. West.
<s> That leaves two strangers.
<s> She might.
<s> The card says so, doesn't it?
<s> I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
<s> With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
<s> I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
<s> He was delightful.
<s> What a shame.
<s> Penfield.  James Penfield.
<s> Very good.
<s> She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
<s> Don't tell me you've actually read it, Jeremy.
<s> Of course.
<s> Thank you.
<s> And to history.
<s> No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
<s> You just might.
<s> No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
<s> Come on.  Hand over.
<s> Oh yes.
<s> Mmm...
<s> We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
<s> She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.
<s> Now listen...
<s> You'd look naked without one.
<s> It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
<s> Where?
<s> Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
<s> 'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight.
<s> Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
<s> See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade.
<s> I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
<s> Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
<s> Not so far.
<s> A little mushy.
<s> Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
<s> Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
<s> He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
<s> Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
<s> This Zen master surfer.
<s> Yeah, or cashing a check.
<s> I'm serious.
<s> Catch of the day.
<s> What?
<s> Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
<s> Tyler, put the gun down.
<s> Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.  Right?!  Well you figured wrong, dork!
<s> Who cares!
<s> No way, old buddy.
<s> Like the old days, Dillon.
<s> This gets better by the minute.
<s> Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
<s> We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
<s> The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
<s> Anytime.
<s> What, Sergeant?
<s> We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
<s> I saw it.
<s> It's been a long time, General.
<s> We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time.
<s> He knows our defenses.
<s> Please, we hardly know each other.
<s> I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
<s> What?
<s> I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
<s> What's that?
<s> Sure.  For five bucks.
<s> No.
<s> Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
<s> For an hour.
<s> Fine.
<s> I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
<s> Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred.
<s> They should be.  They're both good at it.
<s> Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
<s> I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
<s> I sell them.
<s> What?
<s> All right, two thousand.
<s> Done.
<s> I got a dress, yeah.
<s> Dinner can wait.
<s> I think it's exciting.
<s> I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
<s> I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
<s> Did you?
<s> Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
<s> It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
<s> Yes.  The man made a business decision.
<s> It was a business decision.
<s> Afternoon.
<s> Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
<s> Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!
<s> Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
<s> Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.
<s> The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
<s> Give me twenty minutes.
<s> I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
<s> I pray for that.
<s> Do I!?  Momma!
<s> I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day.
<s> I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
<s> I like steak.
<s> Steak spoon! 
<s> Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
<s> I think it's great.
<s> I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
<s> Should I be?
<s> Well ... you were dead.
<s> And a good thing too.
<s> Who's Guilder?
<s> It's you.
<s> Perhaps not. I feel fine.
<s> -- where?
<s> What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
<s> We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
<s> Because I can stop now if you want.
<s> What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
<s> You want me to read this or not?
<s> No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
<s> DEATH FIRST!!
<s> And our assets?
<s> True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
<s> I thought he was with you.
<s> -- offer me money --
<s> -- power too -- promise me that --
<s> -- offer me everything I ask for --
<s> Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
<s> Nothing comes to mind.
<s> Then why are you smiling?
<s> I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
<s> You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
<s> -- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.
<s> I will. And I choose --
<s> You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
<s> Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
<s> He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
<s> I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
<s> Congratulations.
<s> It's nothing ... nothing.
<s> It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
<s> Oh, it's all right ... wha?
<s> Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
<s> You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
<s> Exactly.  And how long did it run?
<s> I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.
<s> Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
<s> Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
<s> Right.
<s> You found a flop!
<s> I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
<s> Only if we ask him.
<s> It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.
<s> Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
<s> All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.
<s> Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
<s> All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.
<s> No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
<s> Here I come, ready or not.
<s> And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.
<s> Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
<s> Ta.  Ta.
<s> Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it.
<s> By the sacred memory...
<s> Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
<s> What have you done, LSD?
<s> What do you do best?
<s> We won.
<s> I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
<s> Or arrived with her.
<s> How did she pay you?
<s> Cash or check? For the cabin...
<s> And when she left, she never came back.
<s> She isn't still here, is she?
<s> How much?
<s> It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
<s> I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
<s> With the forty thousand dollars?
<s> Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
<s> May I talk to you?
<s> I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
<s> I hate tears. 
<s> Yes.
<s> It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
<s> Maybe we can handle it together. 
<s> Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
<s> Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
<s> Sam! Why call when we can go?
<s> Sam, I'm going.
<s> Just wait here?
<s> Well?
<s> Does that mean we can't...
<s> All right! Then call! At least, call!
<s> Neither will I.
<s> She always tries to be proper.
<s> How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
<s> Bates never denied Mary was here.
<s> Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
<s> This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
<s> Sam, let's go get married.
<s> Los Angeles.
<s> You'd know, of course.
<s> Uncommon, too.
<s> Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
<s> I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
<s> I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Why?
<s> Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
<s> He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
<s> Yes.
<s> I didn't think so.
<s> Do what?
<s> Left Phoenix under her own steam?
<s> Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
<s> You--a friend to me?
<s> I don't know--I can't tell--
<s> That sounds to me very remarkable.
<s> By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
<s> Well, news of Buckley?
<s> Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
<s> Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
<s> It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
<s> I'm going to call the police.
<s> It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
<s> A voice ...
<s> But ... the dogs...
<s> No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
<s> No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
<s> It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue! 
<s> I don't agree with you.
<s> You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
<s> Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
<s> Delighted, I'm sure. 
<s> What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
<s> I'm not quarreling, only ...
<s> Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
<s> And I have no desire to hurt you. You will always be beautiful. Think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.
<s> You mean he was colored?
<s> So you can give me an argument and tell me I'm wrong. Don't be sil, Kid.
<s> What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
<s> How's every little thing?
<s> Old Howard Winton's cub?
<s> Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
<s> What does that prove?
<s> I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
<s> Better cut that out.  That's what happens to girls who bite their nails.  What's wrong?
<s> They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
<s> We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
<s> No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
<s> Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
<s> That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
<s> To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
<s> That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
<s> They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
<s> Dad...
<s> Where to?
<s> The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
<s> Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
<s> What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
<s> He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
<s> Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
<s> First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
<s> Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
<s> You're going to get yourself up and go out?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah, I'd believe it.
<s> Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!
<s> Yeah, he's still up there.
<s> Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
<s> Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
<s> I think Daddy suspects.
<s> I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
<s> At least.
<s> Buddy, that was my place.
<s> That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
<s> Here comes Daddy.
<s> There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.
<s> The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.
<s> Yes, of course.
<s> Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.
<s> It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
<s> But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
<s> But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
<s> You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
<s> Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
<s> But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?
<s> Over... my... dead... body!
<s> Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
<s> Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
<s> Page proof of a book I'm working on.
<s> Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
<s> It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
<s> I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic?
<s> Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
<s> Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
<s> It'll get better now.
<s> I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
<s> I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
<s> Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
<s> Lay off once, would you?
<s> We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
<s> Hands off the suit, monkey-boy. Close your eyes if you're scared.
<s> Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes.  It's a tax dodge.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't know.  I could quit now if I wanted, I just don't want to.
<s> You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants?  How do you think it got its name?
<s> It's not gonna happen.
<s> Forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers
<s> What was I supposed to do?
<s> This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
<s> I'm waiting till the time's right.
<s> There'll be other chances.
<s> What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
<s> It's our job.
<s> Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
<s> Don't crowd him.
<s> Shit.  You're right.
<s> Let's hope.
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
<s> Your wish is my command.
<s> Beholden to none.
<s> Who the fuck knows?  We'll find out soon enough.
<s> Know what I love about dynamite?
<s> That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
<s> Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
<s> Yoda will always be with you.
<s> But I have no sister.
<s> Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
<s> Yeah, she's comin' up.
<s> All set.
<s> Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
<s> Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
<s> Let's see.
<s> Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
<s> Here goes nothing.
<s> All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
<s> No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
<s> Your father he is.
<s> Unfortunate that I know the truth?
<s> Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
<s> Oh. Well, yes.
<s> Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
<s> I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
<s> Janet.
<s> For you.
<s> Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
<s> We must have a blow-out.
<s> But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
<s> Yes.
<s> Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
<s> You know this earth - this person.
<s> Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
<s> Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
<s> Makes you cry
<s> Now I
<s> No no no no.
<s> The delivery boy.
<s> Creature of the night.
<s> ...I suppose.
<s> I wanna let my brother know where I am.
<s> I think he might be worried.
<s> Yeah...
<s> I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
<s> ...What?
<s> Don't say that.
<s> Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
<s> Why?
<s> Paulie!
<s> ...I don't feel heat from the name.
<s> Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
<s> He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
<s> ...Stop jivin'!
<s> I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
<s> Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
<s> He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
<s> That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
<s> Of wa?
<s> Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face!
<s> ...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
<s> Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
<s> Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
<s> I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'
<s> Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
<s> The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
<s> Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
<s> Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
<s> That's it.
<s> I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
<s> Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for it...
<s> No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
<s> Sparrin'?
<s> ...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
<s> I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
<s> I said, how ya feelin'?
<s> Come July, twenty-five.
<s> Yeah --
<s> Yeah, Kayo.
<s> Ya puttin' me on?
<s> When was they here?
<s> Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
<s> Ya got heart.
<s> ...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
<s> Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none.
<s> I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
<s> Real good.
<s> ...The guy's great.
<s> Yo, can I have my locker back?
<s> Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
<s> Ain't had time to check 'em.
<s> What?
<s> Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
<s> ...Sure.
<s> Absolutely...
<s> Gazzo's gotta come to you.
<s> Try again, c'mon, try again.
<s> Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
<s> My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
<s> I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
<s> What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
<s> He's a Toon... who cares?
<s> Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
<s> If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
<s> <u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
<s> Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
<s> They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
<s> Earl... it's me, Valiant.
<s> Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
<s> Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
<s> I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
<s> It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
<s> When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
<s> No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
<s> I don't work in Toontown.
<s> The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
<s> As soon as is humanly possible.
<s> I've already seen your photographs.
<s> Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
<s> Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
<s> I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
<s> An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
<s> Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
<s> That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
<s> From this box here...
<s> I do bite my thumb, sir!
<s> If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you.
<s> Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.
<s> Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
<s> Why, what is Tybalt?
<s> Am I like Such a fellow?
<s> A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
<s> But 'tis no wit to go.
<s> The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
<s> I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
<s> Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
<s> Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
<s> The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
<s> A thousand times good night! Exit, above
<s> Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
<s> Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
<s> I thought all for the best.
<s> Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
<s> So where do you go from here?
<s> Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
<s> Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
<s> Now there's the Deirdre I know.
<s> That's him.
<s> Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
<s> You were a soldier, were you?
<s> The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
<s> I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.
<s> There's a problem...
<s> Enough!
<s> It is, I'm telling you it is!!
<s> It's done.
<s> Don't cross me...
<s> I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
<s> Hello, my friend.  He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.
<s> Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
<s> I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
<s> You seem one to me.
<s> Is that right?
<s> No thanks.
<s> That's what I thought.
<s> Jujitsu.
<s> I do.
<s> I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
<s> That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
<s> You were smoking?
<s> Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many you'd like.
<s> But you can't.
<s> I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
<s> Yes.
<s> Right now?
<s> If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
<s> Finish it!
<s> Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate smoking alone.  How about you?  I thought all you IRA types smoked.
<s> You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
<s> I'm alright.  And you?
<s> The Russian would be easier.
<s> I want to get some hounds down here.
<s> Dwayne listen to me -
<s> Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
<s> We'll figure something out.
<s> Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
<s> Torch it?!
<s> I...I can't do that.
<s> Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
<s> All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
<s> For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
<s> Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
<s> No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
<s> Dwayne had the opportunity, just like us.  He was at the scene.  He grabbed the cash.  Of course.  This is perfect!
<s> Rock solid.
<s> That's the deal.  If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
<s> Just take it in stride.
<s> Yeah but I need to take out four hundred dollars and the ATM will only give me three.
<s> He's irresponsible.
<s> Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
<s> Great...
<s> It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
<s> I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
<s> Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved --
<s> Have you known this all along?
<s> Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.
<s> Is this marked money, or what?
<s> What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
<s> I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye wont immediately look.
<s> All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
<s> Sort of.
<s> Yeah whaddya want?.
<s> Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
<s> So be here at three.
<s> A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
<s> Right behind you.
<s> We're gonna talk.
<s> It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
<s> At least around here it does.
<s> I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
<s> What do you think?  Heart attack?
<s> How much is that?
<s> Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
<s> Is this about the funny money?
<s> I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
<s> I don't think so.
<s> I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
<s> We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
<s> I don't think so...
<s> C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
<s> No.  It's my first time.
<s> Those girls drove off because of you.
<s> Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
<s> I knew you were lying.
<s> Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
<s> Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
<s> My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
<s> Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
<s> Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
<s> Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
<s> Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
<s> Gimme the binoculars.
<s> She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
<s> It's a bomb.
<s> She never even looked at you.
<s> Why did you help me?
<s> You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
<s> I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
<s> Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
<s> A Chinese man discovered electricity.
<s> Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
<s> Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
<s> Follow me my Asian brother.
<s> It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.
<s> Yes.
<s> Some Kung-Pao?
<s> Fine with me.
<s> No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard of the Superbill?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Yes, Master.
<s> Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
<s> A little.
<s> Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet!
<s> No.
<s> Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
<s> Stooly.
<s> Thank you. I learn a great deal.
<s> Yes, I know this song.
<s> Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
<s> Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it.
<s> What's wrong with that?
<s> Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
<s> Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
<s> Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
<s> You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
<s> Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
<s> Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
<s> I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
<s> How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
<s> Ambassador Han.
<s> It's Griffin.
<s> Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
<s> Carter, can I have a moment?
<s> Let me take you back inside, okay?
<s> I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
<s> He's here!... He's here!
<s> "Never say die."
<s> Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
<s> I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.
<s> I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
<s> Where do you think she's going?
<s> It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
<s> Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
<s> She's a cacophony of contradictions.
<s> It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
<s> You'll answer my questions?
<s> Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
<s> Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
<s> How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
<s> Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
<s> I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
<s> So?  Is that what you said to her?
<s> Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
<s> You don't know.
<s> Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
<s> No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
<s> Can you fix it?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
<s> Or the sexual habits of locusts?
<s> Well, you do have the dress.
<s> Lighten up, what?
<s> Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
<s> No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
<s> Quick.  Very quick.
<s> Thank you, Dad.
<s> "And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
<s> No.
<s> That's good.
<s> So you're angry.  Big deal.
<s> It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
<s> They're going to love you.
<s> What is it?
<s> Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
<s> -- it was a betrayal.
<s> There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
<s> That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
<s> I know.
<s> Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
<s> M.F.E.O.?
<s> I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
<s> Okay.
<s> Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
<s> You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --
<s> I know. 
<s> It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
<s> Yes, I did.
<s> We'll move them --
<s> I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
<s> Destiny takes a hand.
<s> What?
<s> What?
<s> Magic.
<s> Magic.
<s> Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
<s> The cabinets have to be redone --
<s> Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
<s> Have you had any relationship since?
<s> I don't think I could really describe it.
<s> I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there.  Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas.
<s> Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
<s> How about rapacious and love- starved?
<s> This is going to be tougher than I thought.
<s> Yeah.  What's that?
<s> I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
<s> It's never happening again. Right?
<s> Nobody else is going to know it was us.
<s> What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
<s> P.  Dad?
<s> Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
<s> Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
<s> I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
<s> Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
<s> She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
<s> Victoria? She's okay.
<s> I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
<s> Are you going with her?
<s> Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
<s> Okay.
<s> Well...
<s> He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
<s> I read the same article...
<s> No thanks.
<s> I say we gotta take action. Now.
<s> It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
<s> What do you mean -- sex equality?
<s> An American.
<s> Don't you worry. We'll get some action.
<s> Got to talk to the brothers.
<s> What?
<s> I did forget. Lus told me.
<s> He was born fighting. And born hungry.
<s> I've had them since the day they were born.
<s> We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
<s> We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
<s> Hunting.
<s> The what!
<s> You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
<s> You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
<s> He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
<s> That's it?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Now that's down-right insulting.
<s> Why not?
<s> How?
<s> I try.
<s> You really need to lighten up.
<s> This has nothing to do with him.
<s> Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
<s> Therapy session is over.
<s> No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
<s> You can still work.
<s> Find a new job.
<s> Ass first into the world.
<s> I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
<s> I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
<s> It's Tom.
<s> Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
<s> Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.
<s> A quarter of a million, Jimmy.
<s> The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
<s> Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
<s> I think on account of his nose.
<s> Yes, Jimmy.
<s> You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
<s> It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?
<s> I can't tell you.
<s> Hey, okay.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
<s> God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
<s> News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
<s> Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
<s> Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
<s> Who the hell is Jimmy?
<s> They have. But they never found a lab.
<s> Funny, I don't feel lucky.
<s> Again, I thank you.
<s> Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
<s> Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
<s> That is so unfair.
<s> Don't we always take good care of you?
<s> Maybe he isn't showing.
<s> A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
<s> Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
<s> It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> You must be a hell a shot.
<s> Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
<s> Of course, sir.
<s> In the shadow by those two trees.
<s> Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
<s> It was nothing.
<s> I heard.
<s> Plenty.
<s> Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
<s> I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
<s> Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
<s> Simpson.
<s> I've got a line on one.
<s> PUSH!
<s> Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
<s> Three for three.
<s> Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
<s> How about I go right, sir?
<s> And what about your own hand?
<s> Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
<s> Just what I want to do.
<s> Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
<s> Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
<s> Ours is not to reason why.
<s> Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
<s> Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
<s> Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
<s> What if our guys open up, sir?
<s> I coach the baseball team, too.
<s> More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
<s> Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?
<s> Struggling with a pair of Germans.
<s> What are we likely to run into?
<s> Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?
<s> Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
<s> Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
<s> Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.
<s> We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
<s> And your former wife.
<s> Good thing there's not a red line on you, J-man. YEAH!
<s> Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
<s> I am.
<s> What?  I'm sorry, talk.
<s> I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
<s> Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
<s> Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
<s> Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> You're going.
<s> Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> It's the worst job since keymaster.
<s> Bye.
<s> Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
<s> Basic.  Hmmm.
<s> I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.
<s> I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
<s> Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
<s> I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?
<s> You're cold.
<s> Then why are you shaking?
<s> Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
<s> My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
<s> Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
<s> Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
<s> Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.
<s> Fine Lloyd.
<s> Yeah.  Honey?
<s> Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
<s> Very talented.
<s> Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right?  That's gotta be a good thing.
<s> What?
<s> I love you too.
<s> Yeah, alright.
<s> Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
<s> Oskar, please -
<s> I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
<s> Well, you've been through it.  You know. You could make things easier for me.
<s> I don't know.  Soon.
<s> I just told you.
<s> You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
<s> My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
<s> Look it up.
<s> Yeah, I can.
<s> Yeah, okay.
<s> Nice things cost money.
<s> Things are great, things are great.
<s> We're losing the war, aren't we.
<s> So I'll talk to him about it.
<s> Yes.
<s> What other point is -
<s> He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
<s> Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
<s> That's too bad.
<s> Can we talk?
<s> You could start with an apology.
<s> What?
<s> Did you do it?
<s> Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'll get my jacket.
<s> Let us decide that.
<s> Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
<s> I really dont like that comparison, honey.
<s> Hope youre ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
<s> Miss Weathers.
<s> Not good.
<s> ..and as lonely as I am...
<s> And Joel's pre-med.
<s> It's what you want from me.
<s> It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
<s> Oh my God.
<s> But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
<s> Hello?  Hello?
<s> Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
<s> No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
<s> The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A horrifying, sickening sight.
<s> Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
<s> Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
<s> But...
<s> Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
<s> Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
<s> Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
<s> Hello.
<s> Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
<s> I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
<s> To me Hollywood is about death.
<s> I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
<s> Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
<s> Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
<s> Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
<s> You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
<s> It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
<s> Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
<s> Someone stole Sid's file?
<s> I'm sorry, this is too good!
<s> Fuck!
<s> Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
<s> Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
<s> Just Jennifer.  And you.
<s> What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
<s> None.
<s> Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
<s> Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
<s> Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
<s> Who?
<s> Roman that's not the line.
<s> Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
<s> Well then the people you need to call are the police.
<s> No one's saying you did.
<s> So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
<s> You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today.
<s> Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
<s> No, it's not.
<s> Where the fuck did she go?
<s> I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
<s> Now that it's out of your system.
<s> Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
<s> You have to move on, Sid.
<s> Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
<s> I called my dad.
<s> Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
<s> Do I?
<s> You never told me your name.
<s> Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
<s> I'll even give you a warm up question.
<s> Come on, yes you do.
<s> What?
<s> I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
<s> Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
<s> You never know when or where a story will break.
<s> I'll get my camera.
<s> Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
<s> Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
<s> And my Dad? Any word on him?
<s> Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
<s> Afraid not.
<s> What were you doing out here?
<s> Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
<s> She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
<s> I saw him leaving wearing it.
<s> Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.
<s> Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
<s> So where are you?
<s> That's the original part.
<s> Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
<s> Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
<s> You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
<s> They think it's school-related?
<s> How do you gut someone?
<s> I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
<s> It was him, Tatum. I know it.
<s> Come on, let's rock.
<s> Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
<s> I did. He's full of shit.
<s> What am I? The beer wench?
<s> You're wound too tight, Mills.  Let it go.
<s> I'm in.
<s> Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
<s> I thought you might want to be filled in.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.
<s> I read about it in the paper.
<s> I'll see you.
<s> Her pretty head.
<s> NO!
<s> Spit it out.
<s> Sit back.
<s> It's close.
<s> What the fuck is going on here?!
<s> All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
<s> No one yet.
<s> Is there any blood in it?
<s> This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
<s> What about sports?
<s> I read.  Remember reading?
<s> Forced what?
<s> Okay.  But, what?
<s> We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
<s> No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
<s> What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.
<s> I don't.  Neither do you.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> It was him.
<s> Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
<s> Don't do this... please...
<s> I... I don't understand.
<s> I can't do this now... please.
<s> What?  Oh, yes.  I mean, thank you.  Please, sit down.
<s> That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
<s> It just happened to be me...No need to make any more of it...
<s> Don't argue!...And stay close... Maybe they're rustlers...and maybe this dodderin' old idiot ain't so far wrong...
<s> Why don't you finish the job?
<s> What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
<s> I ain't wearing no gun.
<s> ...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
<s> Just keep goin'...
<s> There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
<s> God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
<s> But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
<s> Grab hold!...
<s> SURE!...They <U>WERE</U> here...Now they're out there...an' waitin' to jump us!...
<s> Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
<s> Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
<s> You got it with you?
<s> <U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
<s> Oh...
<s> He just couldn't wait...
<s> Scar?
<s> But I just bought a good blanket.
<s> Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
<s> Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
<s> You've seen her!...She's alive?
<s> Ain't worth the mendin'...
<s> You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
<s> Finish your breakfast...
<s> One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
<s> It isn't fair...
<s> Only if I'm dead!
<s> You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
<s> You'll never get away from me!
<s> We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
<s> We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
<s> So do I, believe me.
<s> Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
<s> Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
<s> An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
<s> But what is the truth?
<s> It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
<s> We should leave the past alone.
<s> Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
<s> Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
<s> And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
<s> Right you are, governor!
<s> Lady?
<s> Ask him.
<s> It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
<s> I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
<s> She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
<s> yet cannot love nor write it.
<s> Cut his nose off.
<s> What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
<s> Oh, that.
<s> Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
<s> I don't know. It's a mystery.
<s> Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
<s> Who are you?
<s> Fifty pounds? What for?
<s> Is it about a pirate's daughter?
<s> Tomorrow
<s> What? Who?
<s> No, it will turn out well.
<s> Go on.
<s> "Is the day so young?"
<s> I will.
<s> All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
<s> I am, Master Shakespeare.
<s> "What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
<s> I have to get back.
<s> It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
<s> Oh, but it will end well for love?
<s> You lie.
<s> Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
<s> You cannot marry Wessex!
<s> "Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
<s> Write me well.
<s> I will do my duty, my lord.
<s> Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
<s> For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
<s> Are you bringing your laundry woman?
<s> A theatre poet?
<s> I haven't lost yet.
<s> Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
<s> About what?
<s> I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
<s> All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
<s> Then what? Who's going to do what?
<s> Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Security.
<s> No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
<s> You're not eating.
<s> They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
<s> So I gathered.
<s> Where do you think you'll go?
<s> I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
<s> I don't know anything about it.
<s> What does it look like?
<s> What?
<s> No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.
<s> Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
<s> I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
<s> What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
<s> What I am.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What? What's wrong?
<s> Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
<s> But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
<s> And now you tell me.
<s> You were magnificent.
<s> Then let's spend some money.
<s> No, no, it's different.
<s> Don't you?
<s> Forget it -- he'll come down.
<s> No.
<s> As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
<s> Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
<s> Oh, shut up, Alex.
<s> The perfect couple, I should say.
<s> What about?
<s> Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
<s> Someone lost the key.
<s> Did you ever kill a man?
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
<s> Yes. They're my friends.
<s> And you need your sleep.
<s> Exactly what I was --
<s> Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
<s> That one, last week.
<s> The telephone? It continues to ring.
<s> Did he sound upset?
<s> I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
<s> Is it real?
<s> I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
<s> -- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
<s> That's okay too.
<s> My keys.
<s> I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
<s> Gee, that's very serious...
<s> So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
<s> You're very rude... if you don't come back --
<s> I don't want to see you anymore.
<s> I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
<s> I'm coming, baby --  How's Otis doing, anyway?
<s> No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
<s> No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
<s> Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
<s> Right.
<s> Well, yeah... you know.
<s> Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
<s> Jill's really great, isn't she?
<s> Yeah... I mean great.
<s> I don't want to... I swear...
<s> I am you, you little bastard.
<s> Sammy's?
<s> The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
<s> Nothing.
<s> -- we are?
<s> What?
<s> Wash her.
<s> -- please, please forgive me...
<s> -- how did you get here?
<s> I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
<s> I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
<s> What're you talking about?
<s> Where?
<s> Well, like what?
<s> Who?
<s> Honey, what happened?
<s> What about me?
<s> We live together now.
<s> Hey, baby, what's happening?
<s> I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
<s> Okay.
<s> What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
<s> -- go ahead.
<s> What did you say?
<s> But Mr. Norman said --
<s> That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
<s> -- yeah?
<s> Isn't that bad for it?
<s> Yeah.  How long have you been here?
<s> Well... who are those guys?
<s> Now wait a minute...
<s> I'm not anti-Establishment.
<s> Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.
<s> What, do you think I planned it?
<s> I know.
<s> Oh yeah...
<s> No --
<s> Yes I do.
<s> I'll call you back.
<s> I'll call you back.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
<s> Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
<s> You know what's wrong.
<s> Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
<s> No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
<s> But you have problems?
<s> -- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
<s> I'm exaggerating.
<s> Honey?
<s> I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
<s> -- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
<s> Well, there was this one time --
<s> -- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
<s> That's right.
<s> Sure.
<s> Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> -- oh I don't know --
<s> -- just wonderful.
<s> John...
<s> Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
<s> Okay.
<s> Do you feel bad?
<s> Is there something bad here?
<s> Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
<s> Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
<s> Danny... what's the matter, hon?
<s> Danny!
<s> Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
<s> Yes.
<s> Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
<s> Fine.
<s> That's right, sir.
<s> Grady... oh.
<s> Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
<s> No problem, Mr. Ullman.  I was just getting to the ice cream.
<s> It's good to be back, Lloyd.
<s> What time is it?
<s> I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
<s> Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
<s> Yes.
<s> I think he did it to himself.
<s> Jack...
<s> Why?
<s> Why?
<s> Give me the bat.
<s> Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
<s> Well, it's very... homely.
<s> Oh!
<s> Just like a ghost ship, huh?
<s> Fine.
<s> What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
<s> She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
<s> Yeah... sure.
<s> You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
<s> You want to know what I think?
<s> I told you!
<s> You're not going to let it go, are you?
<s> If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
<s> Well... thank you.
<s> Perhaps.
<s> BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
<s> Yes, Mary?
<s> And you listen to that?
<s> Good evening, Vincent.
<s> Right.
<s> Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
<s> Chops?
<s> Enough jabber.
<s> I knew that.
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> You re okay -- for a civilian.
<s> Five a.m.?
<s> I... I brought you something.
<s> Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> She won't?  Why not?
<s> Mary Clarence!
<s> Enough joking.
<s> What? 
<s> Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
<s> A what?
<s> Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
<s> Useless distractions.
<s> Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
<s> Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
<s> You have a phone call.
<s> I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
<s> You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
<s> Don't push it.
<s> A what? When are you qonna wake up?
<s> What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
<s> Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
<s> What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
<s> Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
<s> You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
<s> Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
<s> I think they'd understand.
<s> You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
<s> Even nuns have to pee.
<s> That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
<s> Oh-huh.
<s> You found him -- but we're not open yet.
<s> I'm telling you!
<s> Which one?
<s> Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
<s> For like, twelve zillion eternities?
<s> However, we can also pray for other things.
<s> Which convent was that, Sister?
<s> It's no use.  She just isn't here.
<s> She wasn't a nun?
<s> And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
<s> Christy.
<s> Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
<s> Find 'em!
<s> What are you spying on?
<s> Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
<s> Master Hardenbrook...
<s> Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
<s> Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
<s> Up.
<s> Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
<s> Father said witches live there.
<s> Listen.
<s> Man or woman?
<s> But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
<s> It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
<s> I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
<s> I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
<s> If you want.  But...
<s> No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
<s> You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
<s> No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
<s> What?
<s> If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
<s> No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
<s> She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
<s> I didn't see none.
<s> No one will believe your lies, whore.
<s> Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.
<s> If it works out and all, maybe we'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to. See you later.
<s> You got any money?
<s> Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
<s> Can I see him?
<s> You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
<s> Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.
<s> This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
<s> You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
<s> You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'. The adults are talkin'. Were you in the lockup for cuttin' somebody up with a hatchet?
<s> Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.
<s> It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
<s> This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
<s> Childers.
<s> Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
<s> I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
<s> They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.
<s> I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
<s> All right then.
<s> All right then.
<s> I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.
<s> Yes sir. Right then it was.
<s> I reckon.
<s> Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?
<s> We'll be on teams, me and you?
<s> You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
<s> Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that.  I aim for you to have these books.
<s> Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
<s> Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?
<s> Okay.
<s> I'm glad of it, honey.
<s> I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
<s> We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.
<s> I told you, I ain't got no boy, now get on out from here and let me be.
<s> Naw.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
<s> No ma'am.
<s> Okay.
<s> You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
<s> I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
<s> So, you're really going to stay here?
<s> That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?
<s> Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
<s> In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
<s> Do you smell shit?
<s> Why won't he talk to women?
<s> Before they were married?
<s> How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
<s> Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
<s> It's my birthday.
<s> Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
<s> I confess.
<s> American literature. What else?
<s> Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
<s> Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
<s> Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
<s> Yeah, I did.
<s> That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
<s> Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
<s> Hi, Auggie.
<s> Yeah, probably.
<s> I mean, it's a good story.
<s> I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
<s> Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
<s> I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
<s> And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
<s> You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
<s> It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
<s> Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?
<s> Sure thing. See you later.
<s> You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?
<s> Huh?
<s> Thanks for the tip.
<s> The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
<s> Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
<s> Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
<s> As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
<s> I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
<s> Just passing through.
<s> I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
<s> That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
<s> It's me, honey. It's Mom.
<s> Baby? And what baby is that?
<s> Yeah? And why is that?
<s> Huh?
<s> Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
<s> Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
<s> Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
<s> Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address. 
<s> This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
<s> Eight-thirty?
<s> Are you going to be all right?
<s> I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
<s> I don't have much time. 
<s> You don't really want to know.
<s> Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
<s> What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.
<s> Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
<s> No way.
<s> And started to run.
<s> That money is my whole future.
<s> The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
<s> He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
<s> What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
<s> Wow. They sure did a job on you.
<s> Everything is real in here, honey.  As real as the color of my hair.
<s> Medium rare, please.
<s> Oh, yeh?
<s> Is that your third question?
<s> You done your math right.
<s> Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
<s> All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
<s> Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
<s> Easy.  Slow is best.
<s> Why?  We're only talking.
<s> Look at my face.  It's the face of the people who did that.  My father hardly speaks English.  We're in bad trouble, you have to see that.
<s> I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
<s> Those aren't the facts that matter.
<s> So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
<s> He said, 'Could it be somebody hit him?'  And I said, 'You want to play Sherlock Holmes, here?'
<s> Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
<s> But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
<s> That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
<s> That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
<s> No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
<s> Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
<s> Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
<s> Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
<s> He hit his head.  On the way in.
<s> I'll take two.  One for later.
<s> You mean, do I like to take the offensive?  Or hang back and wait.
<s> I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
<s> He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
<s> She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
<s> Not in those words.
<s> He had no reason to.
<s> Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.
<s> That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
<s> Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
<s> Why?
<s> Me?  I'm the manager of the band - not the night watchman.
<s> It's entirely mutual.
<s> It's private.  Go away.
<s> What did he say?
<s> I'll say.
<s> Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
<s> Of course I am.
<s> First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
<s> I thought you weren't talking to me.
<s> Tore off one of my chests.
<s> You better come help me.
<s> Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
<s> You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
<s> Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
<s> And what are you trying to do to poor Sugar?  Putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent -  Nobody talks like that!  I've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
<s> You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
<s> He's going to be ashore with you.
<s> Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
<s> Have I got things to tell you!
<s> You think he's too old for me?
<s> I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.
<s> Sssh.  Sweet Sue.
<s> No, no.
<s> You got some?
<s> We have some bourbon - lets make Manhattans.
<s> Thank you, Daphne.
<s> Well, I'll come back later.
<s> I hope so.
<s> This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
<s> I'm not surprised.
<s> Why?
<s> No, thank you.  I'll walk.
<s> Who?
<s> Sorry.
<s> Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
<s> And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
<s> What a heel!  I spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled, I buy me a new negligee, I bake him a great big pizza pie...  - and where were you?
<s> Yes, Joe.
<s> Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
<s> You got to be under twenty-five -
<s> Where did he conduct?
<s> Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
<s> You are?
<s> You're entitled.
<s> I hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop.
<s> Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
<s> I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
<s> Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
<s> Saxophone player?
<s> My fault.
<s> Why?
<s> No, my flag steward.
<s> Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?
<s> - Inauguration balls -
<s> I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
<s> Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
<s> Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
<s> Have I?  I'm trying all the time.
<s> You mean you can't fall in love?
<s> What happened?
<s> If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
<s> What is it?
<s> Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
<s> From a rich millionaire.
<s> Me?
<s> You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
<s> Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
<s> Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
<s> Big joke!
<s> Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
<s> You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?
<s> I already told you.
<s> What? Why? What do you mean?
<s> So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
<s> Or Kat....
<s> Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
<s> Im sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
<s> It was just after we moved here. My little girls got in a fight over Tony Pee-Pants and they havent made up since.
<s> So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
<s> Mom, please.
<s> What?
<s> Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.
<s> Oh, hello.
<s> Shrink, actually.
<s> You have feet?
<s> Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in share. People do that.
<s> Love.
<s> I dont know.
<s> Why?
<s> Its okay. Hell, Ive never paid for it. But please dont feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
<s> What?!
<s> I guess so.
<s> No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
<s> I wasnt saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.
<s> Therapist.
<s> I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. Youre here for the highland flings, I bet.
<s> Give it back? Are you nuts?
<s> Just drunk enough.
<s> I havent thought about that in years.
<s> What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nations most precious resource: your daughter.
<s> Is he here in Borderdale?
<s> David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
<s> What's his name?
<s> And you're a tired little boy. I'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep.
<s> Yes mam...
<s> What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
<s> :His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.
<s> Here, put my jacket over you.
<s> Yes, sir...
<s> "You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
<s> He'll show up one day.
<s> They gone to the field...
<s> Great, son -- not like wakin' up in jail. For a minute or two, didn't quite know where I was, but when I saw your face lookin down on me, made me know right away the day was gonna be a good one, and it all belonged to me!
<s> You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
<s> Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
<s> What's that, son?
<s> Yes, David...
<s> I don't look like no possum!
<s> Thank you, Josie Mae.
<s> 'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.
<s> Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
<s> Did you find your father?
<s> I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
<s> How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
<s> He can't get up, Mama!
<s> And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
<s> What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
<s> Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
<s> I wanta get some things.
<s> I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
<s> Well, let's get to it, Miss Rebecca,'cause I been waitin' too long a time for your good cookin'!
<s> To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
<s> Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
<s> Dude, she's eight years old, just get her some ice cream or something.
<s> The Canadians are just mad that we mothers here in South Park have the chutzpah to stand up to them!  Like it or not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children are now safe from your Canadian smut!
<s> Doggy.
<s> But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
<s> -No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
<s> But what are we going to do against this entire army?
<s> How the fuck should I know!!
<s> Whoops.
<s> What the hell are you guys doing here?
<s> But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem!
<s> Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
<s> Yes, hon?
<s> Young man, you will tell Peincipal Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all these horrible phrases!
<s> Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
<s> Fallen one... We have such sights to show you!
<s> Mph rm.
<s> Dude, what the hell is going on?
<s> We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
<s> You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
<s> Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
<s> I agree! The only way to save our future is to unite and fight!  <b>Something must be done! We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!</b>
<s> Yeah, so what do we say?
<s> Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
<s> Are you sure, Kenny?
<s> What is 'fisting'?
<s> Yes?
<s> And I thought my mother was the master of guilt.  Geez Louise.
<s> I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
<s> <b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b>
<s> Canada is saving us!!
<s> You did? Just now?
<s> Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
<s> Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
<s> THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
<s> What's the matter, Wendy?
<s> You're Warren Wayne.
<s> Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
<s> You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
<s> I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
<s> It's steady, good benefits.
<s> That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
<s> Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
<s> Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
<s> I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
<s> Just don't move around too much.
<s> Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
<s> Like open an airlock by mistake?
<s> I don't know.
<s> With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
<s> Why can't we?
<s> So we did.
<s> One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
<s> The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown.
<s> You too.
<s> Taylor!  Where are you?
<s> Barnes?
<s> I'm about to blow the wall.
<s> How does the distress signal look?
<s> I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
<s> Marry you?
<s> Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
<s> Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
<s> Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
<s> Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
<s> Mac.  What's shaking?
<s> You're not from around here, are you?
<s> What kind of man?
<s> No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
<s> When you get a chance.
<s> La da da dalala...
<s> How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
<s> Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
<s> Theo.
<s> I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
<s> I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
<s> Thanks.
<s> I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
<s> What's it look like to you?
<s> I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
<s> Millie, I know what I'm doing.
<s> I gotta go. Love ya mom.
<s> Cool!
<s> I'll tell you one thing, you won't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose. Stay away from his ass - and don't play any of his fuckin' knock-knock jokes.
<s> It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
<s> Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
<s> It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
<s> If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
<s> No!
<s> See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
<s> You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita's got the stuff?
<s> That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
<s> Now swing it out a little to the right...
<s> Who wants to know?  Zeus!
<s> Mine, and they never tip.
<s> What do you want with my dad?
<s> I'd rather you didn't.
<s> Really? I kinda like it.
<s> I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
<s> It's Junior, isn't it.
<s> He's my father.
<s> Tell me what happened Theo.
<s> I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
<s> I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?
<s> What about plan C?
<s> The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
<s> How long will that be?
<s> What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
<s> Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
<s> It doesn't make any sense.
<s> I don't know.  That's the point.
<s> How drastic?
<s> I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
<s> If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
<s> Jerry?
<s> Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
<s> You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
<s> Working on it now, sir.
<s> Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
<s> I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts.  The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.
<s> A break for what?
<s> Please watch your closest monitor...
<s> We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
<s> What's the message?
<s> What -- you want me to retype it?
<s> What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
<s> What?  No, I know they're civilians...
<s> Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now!
<s> To what?
<s> What's inside the sphere.
<s> A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
<s> My gosh, Norman.
<s> What?
<s> Beth --
<s> Beth.
<s> Beth.
<s> What are they?
<s> We can't.  The storm.  The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
<s> I would.  But my suit --
<s> You don't trust me?
<s> I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
<s> You fixed this suit?  Beth?
<s> Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
<s> But how?
<s> Bingo.
<s> Antihistamine.  For bites.
<s> How do you spell it?
<s> I'll just boost the doses.
<s> Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
<s> It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
<s> Beth -- gimme the gun.
<s> Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's go home.
<s> By the bunks.
<s> A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
<s> Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
<s> I never said that.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Which one?  Let me get the list out.
<s> I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
<s> On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
<s> Am I?
<s> What are they?
<s> I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
<s> Wisconsin?
<s> Hold on.
<s> Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
<s> We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
<s> What is it, Harry?
<s> Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
<s> Think about it.
<s> If it is an alien spacecraft --
<s> Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
<s> See?  No code.  What'd I say?
<s> "We are friends".
<s> It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming "witchcraft".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
<s> Told me what?
<s> Huh?
<s> He's a pussy.
<s> When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> Don't be so supportive, honey.
<s> Four.  Four years --
<s> What?
<s> Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
<s> I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
<s> Who's going to pay me then?
<s> Not bad.
<s> There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
<s> We'll be back before you are, old man.
<s> Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
<s> Oh, so you're a warrior then?
<s> I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
<s> But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
<s> I know that.
<s> Could I learn to feel it?
<s> He's bluffing...
<s> These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
<s> All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.
<s> Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
<s> What are you saying?
<s> Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
<s> Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
<s> Come back here... Where are you going?
<s> You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
<s> That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
<s> Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
<s> I read you sir.
<s> Something... I've got...you don't.
<s> Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
<s> Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
<s> Yes, sir !
<s> Your father will never let you.
<s> The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
<s> Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
<s> No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
<s> Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
<s> You and me, huh ?
<s> Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
<s> So who's got time to get married ?
<s> You're upset, that's alright.
<s> It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
<s> Excuse me...!
<s> Why not ?
<s> It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
<s> Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
<s> I'll go for that.
<s> I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
<s> Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
<s> We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
<s> How are you, Carl ?
<s> Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.
<s> Guess you gotta go.
<s> You got it.
<s> That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
<s> Nah, I don't do that anymore...
<s> All bands.
<s> Teenagers !
<s> Looks like rain.
<s> Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
<s> I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Courage, I guess.
<s> Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
<s> I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
<s> Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.
<s> Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
<s> Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
<s> Kill the bitch.
<s> Yes, sir...
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Yes, sir !
<s> I can't My legs are gone... Get on the boat...
<s> V'ger is that which programmed me.
<s> The information will not be disclosed.
<s> Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
<s> More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
<s> That is how V'ger will survive.
<s> Permission to speak freely, sir?
<s> No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
<s> They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.
<s> We're already two settings below that, sir.
<s> Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
<s> And whatever you sensed out here....
<s> Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
<s> I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --
<s> Precisely.
<s> I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
<s> Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
<s> To you, sir?
<s> <U>Urgent</U> signal from Starfleet, Captain!  <U>All</U> Earth defense systems have gone dead.
<s> That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
<s> No, no, I see...
<s> I understand...
<s> No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
<s> I live there.
<s> What are you doing?  I love your script.
<s> I love your script.
<s> It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
<s> The <u>Firehouse</u>...
<s> What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
<s> Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
<s> Cast stood me up.
<s> They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.
<s> Better idea...
<s> You going to ask me in?
<s> Why?
<s> So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
<s> Gosh, you look nice.
<s> People might be better off.  They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
<s> Not without a rolltop desk.
<s> If I go to jail...?
<s> After Drama Group.
<s> Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
<s> Yes, that's right.
<s> Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
<s> What?
<s> Hi.
<s> Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
<s> It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
<s> Whatever it is.  GO <u>do</u> it.  How you doing on the permit?
<s> I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
<s> Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?  <u>That's</u> where it is...
<s> ...they run on water.
<s> Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
<s> I loved it...he...
<s> I...
<s> We've got three days to...
<s> Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a <u>schoolnight</u>, something...

<s> Thank you.
<s> I wasn't in the car.
<s> He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
<s> I, actually yes.
<s> I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
<s> Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
<s> Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
<s> I know, I know.
<s> ...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
<s> Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
<s> Who got their heads cut?
<s> Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...
<s> Main Street.
<s> The writer.
<s> I don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies...she'd bare her breasts to do a <u>voice</u> over.
<s> We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>.
<s> I have to talk to you.  My wife...
<s> My wife is going to have a baby, and...
<s> Did you, where are we going tonight...?
<s> You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...
<s> You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
<s> Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
<s> I know you do.
<s> Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
<s> I hurt my finger.
<s> I'm gonna nail it.
<s> The girl was in the car.
<s> Her tits!  Her tits!  How, that she signed IN HER CONTRACT, we hired her 'cause of ten years at the Actors Studio? The way she played <u>Medea</u>?...Her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first <u>wife</u>...
<s> The breasts symbolize motherhood...
<s> I didn't say anything to them.
<s> I don't...
<s> What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
<s> That's what I said.
<s> Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
<s> He's got a gift for fiction.
<s> You tell me what to do, I'll do it.

<s> But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
<s> Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
<s> Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
<s> It happens.
<s> I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the Queen...
<s> During sex.
<s> Or blush.  You look pale.
<s> No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
<s> You lied.  If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.  I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!
<s> And...?

<s> I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
<s> This is a joke, right?
<s> I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.
<s> And this is my room so get out!
<s> <u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
<s> That doesn't bother me.
<s> No, <u>his</u> mother's always on time.
<s> He'll be impressed.  The clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...
<s> But Rache...
<s> There you are!
<s> You owe me a quarter.
<s> Alright starve.
<s> Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
<s> I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
<s> I have lava.
<s> Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
<s> Tomorrow?  Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
<s> You dying.
<s> Sooner than later.  You really need to.
<s> Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
<s> Remarried.  There is no move.
<s> Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
<s> It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
<s> I'm worried.
<s> Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
<s> Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
<s> Don't do this.
<s> Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
<s> Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
<s> Just not to me.
<s> To make it easier for them or you?

<s> Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that.

<s> Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
<s> What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
<s> Why not just bring the whole toilet?
<s> Not personally.
<s> Yes?
<s> Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
<s> Don't flatter yourself.
<s> How the hell would you know?
<s> You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
<s> Luke's depo ran late.  I promised I'd take notes.
<s> She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
<s> Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
<s> You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
<s> Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
<s> And her...?
<s> Give 'em my number.
<s> Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
<s> Aw.
<s> You're the hip and fresh.
<s> We have to talk.
<s> I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
<s> Can't handle them myself is what you mean.  Can't.
<s> That's not us.
<s> For rape and murder.
<s> You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
<s> Nothing, I guess
<s> Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
<s> Yes, Mikey?
<s> Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
<s> But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
<s> Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
<s> I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
<s> The same.
<s> Man, it's just, like, conversation.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
<s> Hi, Dad!
<s> Well, now you have.
<s> Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
<s> Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
<s> Thanks.
<s> 'Fuck me hard!'
<s> Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
<s> Any books you like to read for fun?
<s> Oh, fine. How are you?
<s> Great!
<s> That's what I was gonna ask you.
<s> Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
<s> Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah?
<s> HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.
<s> So where'd you get in?
<s> Well get someone down there!
<s> We don't have time!
<s> I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
<s> What happened?
<s> Well Cooper...
<s> Even better.
<s> Where does it lead?
<s> I said I don't want any, goddammit!
<s> She's still alive.
<s> He's in there...
<s> She's as good as gone...
<s> I'm sure you'll figure it out.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> How much do they have?
<s> What!
<s> We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
<s> I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.
<s> Excellent...excellent!
<s> We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.
<s> Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
<s> Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
<s> I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
<s> Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
<s> See!  See, I told you.
<s> Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
<s> Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
<s> Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
<s> He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
<s> General Schmuck?
<s> I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
<s> Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
<s> I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
<s> But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
<s> I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
<s> To you, sir.  But how do I know?
<s> No, sir.
<s> Plan-R????
<s> No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
<s> Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
<s> I know that, sir.
<s> I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
<s> He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
<s> That's close enough, Major.
<s> You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
<s> Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
<s> I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
<s> That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
<s> Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
<s> Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
<s> I presume the planes are armed?
<s> Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
<s> Maybe it's an exercise.
<s> Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
<s> Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.
<s> They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
<s> Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
<s> Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.
<s> I think they mean business.
<s> Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.
<s> Let's see...International Morse, I think ...K...E...O...P...E...R...E...C...A...L... L...M...I...S...T...A...K...E...O...P...E... Gee, I don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.
<s> Very interesting.
<s> Primary trigger switch.
<s> All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.
<s> Recall what mistake?
<s> Like hell it does.
<s> I don't get you, King.
<s> Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
<s> But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
<s> But I get a red light.
<s> But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
<s> But how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors won't ---  Hey, King....you're not thinking of --- You don't mean you'd --- ???
<s> Let me check.
<s> Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Why is everything about you, Jeff?
<s> Yeah, when's he coming?
<s> Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
<s> Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
<s> Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
<s> Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
<s> Now?
<s> What?
<s> He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...
<s> The dude wants it.
<s> You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
<s> No.
<s> No, I mean, no one.
<s> No, no.
<s> Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
<s> She's dead.
<s> Guess not.
<s> No.
<s> I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
<s> You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
<s> This is private property, my friend.
<s> We're your customers. We're not complaining.
<s> That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
<s> Oh, thanks. Thanks.
<s> I didn't want to eat this much, man.
<s> Really?
<s> You cut off your little finger?
<s> No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
<s> He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
<s> Funny shit, man.
<s> Pony and I are friends.
<s> Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
<s> No. We were just gonna go someplace or something to...
<s> Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
<s> Ask your girlfriend.
<s> Yeah, fuck 'em.
<s> I hit her.
<s> Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
<s> Wow. You did that for me?
<s> Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
<s> Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
<s> Just go home, alright?
<s> Is that Bee-Bee?
<s> Seven-twenty.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I don't know. I think she's breathing.
<s> Man?
<s> Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
<s> Typical male.
<s> Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
<s> And?
<s> You do.
<s> Jeff!
<s> No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
<s> But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
<s> Is that a threat?
<s> Shit, Jeff!
<s> Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
<s> Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
<s> Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
<s> Yeah, good.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier.
<s> Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
<s> Burnfield. No place like it.
<s> Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
<s> It's stupid.
<s> You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
<s> Hey.
<s> Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
<s> I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
<s> I get final approval. It's in my contract.
<s> Oh, no, man. I can't.
<s> Mm-hm.
<s> That's because I am.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Where do you get your ideas?
<s> Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
<s> If you hit me...
<s> It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
<s> I'm here.
<s> I just pulled and it - it came off.
<s> Look, it's really not my fault.
<s> Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
<s> My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
<s> Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.
<s> No...I've been pregnant.
<s> No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
<s> Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
<s> But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.
<s> But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
<s> Jus some girlie things for the squad.
<s> Well, I want to know what happened --
<s> Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!
<s> For a pack of cigs?  I use her food stamps.
<s> You're kidding.
<s> I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...
<s> Hey, I even took my parents' foster kid money.  Phillipe's gonna have to gather rice without pants this month.
<s> My what?
<s> Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
<s> So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere!
<s> Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
<s> The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
<s> Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
<s> Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
<s> Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
<s> As for instance?
<s> Are you hungry?
<s> I tell you this is half sold.
<s> I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
<s> It will?
<s> Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
<s> That's the trouble with you readers.  You know all the plots. Now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils.
<s> Second generation, huh?
<s> Nice job.
<s> Twenty-two.
<s> I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
<s> Whose?
<s> No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
<s> Joe, I can't look at you any more.
<s> Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.
<s> Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
<s> I don't care anyway.  I want the coffin to be white.  And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
<s> Get out!
<s> Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
<s> Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
<s> Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.
<s> You can stay here.
<s> Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
<s> Just a scene I cut out.
<s> Come here!
<s> Just follow me.
<s> "Mad about the boy."
<s> What right do you have to take me for granted?
<s> Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
<s> So he said it quite a few years ago.  So what?  I never looked better in my life.  Do you know why?  Because I've never been as happy in my life.
<s> I ran into some people I knew.
<s> Good.
<s> Good.
<s> I went for a walk.
<s> I haven't done anything, Norma.
<s> Yes, I am, Norma.
<s> Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
<s> You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
<s> Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
<s> Go on in.
<s> It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
<s> There are no locks anywhere in this house.
<s> I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
<s> I just found out why all those tele- phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond they want.  It is the car they want to rent.
<s> You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
<s> I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
<s> She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
<s> It was I who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem.  I could have gone on witn my career, only I found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me.  You see, I was her rirst husband.
<s> Frankly, no.
<s> Along is no good.  I need it now.
<s> Thank you, Max.
<s> What do you want?
<s> It's for your own protection.
<s> I'm taking you to the hospital.
<s> Later.
<s> I have to.
<s> Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
<s> Yes. It reminds me of home.
<s> Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
<s> You don't like me? You hate me?
<s> I sort of like what you said.
<s> Hello. Are you still mad at me?
<s> How do I fight it?
<s> I'll drink to that.
<s> This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
<s> That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.
<s> How do you know?
<s> Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
<s> You bet your ass.
<s> She's a beast.
<s> Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
<s> Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.
<s> No, MR. Danvers.
<s> Throw him out.
<s> You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
<s> Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
<s> It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
<s> What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
<s> I knew it!
<s> No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
<s> Then come with me.
<s> You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
<s> Going to try. Didn't say I could.
<s> Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
<s> Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
<s> Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
<s> It sure is.
<s> Oh...I came close once.
<s> There's a lot of choices here.
<s> Me too. That's why I put this one up.
<s> Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
<s> We get together sometimes.
<s> They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
<s> I know, I'm the fault.
<s> Who gets it, the company?
<s> I'm tryin' to.
<s> Black or regular?
<s> Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
<s> I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
<s> You designed it?
<s> What will it get me?
<s> It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
<s> Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
<s> Just a second.
<s> I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
<s> Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
<s> But the other night...
<s> Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
<s> Hey, I know a lot of things!
<s> Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
<s> 53!
<s> My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
<s> Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
<s> How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
<s> So far the hostages are unharmed.
<s> Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
<s> Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
<s> Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
<s> Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
<s> Maybe you wanted to.
<s> Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
<s> I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.
<s> Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
<s> What else is ballast for?
<s> It's beautiful.
<s> Yes, but it's not all I feel.
<s> My kind of people.
<s> To ski?
<s> Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!
<s> Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
<s> Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
<s> Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
<s> Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
<s> Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
<s> I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
<s> We must combine our strength.
<s> Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
<s> . . . Let me get my purse.
<s> But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.
<s> No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
<s> Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
<s> And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
<s> And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
<s> Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
<s> Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
<s> That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
<s> You are . . . nothing. I am father now.
<s> Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
<s> Albert!
<s> One of them should've been you.
<s> What's she doing in California?
<s> I know.
<s> Well!
<s> Not really, no.
<s> What the  --  !
<s> Oh.
<s> Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
<s> Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
<s> Tough guy, huh?
<s> I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
<s> I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
<s> There was a recipe on the back  --
<s> A night on the town instead of under it?
<s> What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
<s> I want to know what my child is going to face.
<s> Twenty-four.
<s> Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
<s> Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
<s> The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
<s> 195 pounds.
<s> No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared.  What are you waiting for?
<s> Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
<s> Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
<s> Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
<s> --  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...
<s> You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
<s> They'll soon be over.
<s> For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
<s> We'll see how fast I can fly.
<s> Ally.  That was my nickname.
<s> Which one?
<s> Why are you telling me this?
<s> Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
<s> You believe that?
<s> You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
<s> Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
<s> And what's that?
<s> Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling?  Who should care about what I'm feeling?
<s> There might have been a word or two that slipped by.  Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.
<s> Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
<s> Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
<s> The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear.  They were the only parents who did that, together like that.  I guess they're what you might call hippies.
<s> Well, winter's far behind us now.
<s> We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
<s> It's interesting.
<s> I feel like a princess.
<s> No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
<s> No.  What's this lawyer business?
<s> Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left.
<s> So he was mean?
<s> Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
<s> Thank you, Nicole.
<s> People who will help our cause.
<s> What do they do?
<s> Crafts?
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> Yes.
<s> Well, let's see what we get.
<s> No.
<s> Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
<s> No.
<s> Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by.
<s> You remember that much?
<s> Seventy-two miles an hour.
<s> I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
<s> You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
<s> Oh.  I better get some spackle.
<s> Nothing.
<s> No.
<s> Great.
<s> It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
<s> Hitler!
<s> You don't like it, do you.  I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.
<s> And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
<s> See my mother?
<s> Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
<s> Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
<s> I'm late for a date with a dame.
<s> Give me a chance --
<s> No, I wouldn't...
<s> Why, has he bothered you before?
<s> Did Sidney tell you about it?
<s> I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
<s> No...
<s> Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?
<s> Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
<s> Not "we", Sidney, you!
<s> What you promised - do it!  Don't finagle around.  It's later than you think.
<s> Can't hurt...
<s> Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
<s> How does it matter who's sister? The main thing, they're through and -
<s> What about?
<s> Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.
<s> Hello.
<s> It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
<s> Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
<s> Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
<s> I'm used to you...
<s> Take a top coat.
<s> Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
<s> But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.
<s> And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
<s> But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
<s> You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
<s> Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have these two children?  You don't need us.  Your heart and your mind are in here.  But it doesn't love you like we do.
<s> That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
<s> No one must follow your work.
<s> Anything it samples by physical contact.
<s> Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
<s> No problemo.
<s> Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
<s> No problemo.
<s> What?
<s> Go!  I'll finish here.
<s> SHOOT!!!!
<s> Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
<s> There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
<s> And what it that?
<s> I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
<s> You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
<s> There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!
<s> Open the goddamn door!
<s> Correct.
<s> Can you get us in there, past security?
<s> On all what?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares.
<s> I'm Steve. What's your name?
<s> Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
<s> Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
<s> Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
<s> and totally irrelevant.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
<s> Not yet.
<s> That's why he didn't get the hell out of here when he had the chance! I put that to him, he couldn't answer. Why didn't he go and direct in America, like that Italian, Toscanini.
<s> Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
<s> That is correct.
<s> I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
<s> I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
<s> He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
<s> Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
<s> Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
<s> Yes, von der Null.
<s> And what happened to Von der Nul?
<s> I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
<s> Me? Never.  Never.
<s> Do you know what's in this archive?
<s> Show you?
<s> One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
<s> Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
<s> He did?
<s> No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.
<s> Sure.
<s> Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
<s> He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
<s> Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
<s> Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
<s> I won't let the fat kid down.
<s> I thought you did.
<s> 
<s> I don't understand...
<s> Kyle.
<s> John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...
<s> Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
<s> About where you're from.
<s> Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
<s> That's the way it was told to me.
<s> I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
<s> We did it, Kyle.  We got it.
<s> Then how are you supposed to get back?
<s> I can't sleep.
<s> You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
<s> Your father was a friend.  Goddamn it... I watched you grow up.  How do you end up treating me like this?
<s> You could.  But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.
<s> No.  This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland.  I thought you two should meet.
<s> You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
<s> Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
<s> I don't know... he fell.
<s> He's turning blue!
<s> A game?
<s> Where are you going?
<s> You pull me up.
<s> They'll love that.
<s> Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
<s> Hm?  Oh, yes.
<s> Right.  Call me Christy.
<s> Is this you?
<s> Well... the red bra.
<s> You?
<s> God, wake up, it's a con!
<s> Get out.
<s> I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
<s> What are you talking about... ?
<s> Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
<s> Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
<s> What... what do you mean?
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
<s> Stop talking to them!
<s> I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
<s> Big family... small?
<s> Single?
<s> Elizabeth?
<s> I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
<s> This... ?  Oh, this is just... this is the bill.
<s> Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?
<s> An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
<s> Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
<s> You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
<s> Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
<s> They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
<s> His behavior... ?
<s> No.
<s> A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
<s> Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
<s> Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
<s> Sam...  Thank you.
<s> Greetings fellow insomniac.
<s> Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
<s> It's somebody's idea of a joke.
<s> I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
<s> Just stay there, Nell!
<s> You want company?
<s> Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
<s> I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
<s> But there's a sad catch to the story.
<s> I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
<s> It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
<s> My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her.
<s> What?
<s> That?  That's Hill House.
<s> There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
<s> No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
<s> Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
<s> Can't say.  Haven't been here that long.  Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to work.
<s> Mrs. Dudley.
<s> I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
<s> Fifteen dollars.
<s> That's why we're here.
<s> My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
<s> I know.
<s> Maybe you did it yourself.
<s> There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
<s> Well?
<s> I don't think I want any.
<s> I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
<s> It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
<s> Who?
<s> Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
<s> And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
<s> You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
<s> Lookin' good.
<s> Huh?
<s> I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
<s> Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
<s> Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
<s> Faith.
<s> That would be too easy.
<s> Again?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> No, but I know what he means.
<s> Not her brand.
<s> Been busy, have you.
<s> I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went.  It must've been the bars.
<s> Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
<s> Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
<s> Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
<s> Something like that, yeah.
<s> Various enterprises, style of thing.
<s> Why not.
<s> Did you.  What was that in aid of?
<s> You ever been to London?
<s> Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
<s> Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
<s> No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
<s> No kidding.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
<s> Walked.
<s> I doubt it.
<s> What do you think?
<s> They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
<s> I don't want you here, Terry.
<s> -- You know his name is Frank.
<s> Are you finished?
<s> Be seein' you.
<s> Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
<s> Hello, Tony.
<s> Hello, Birdy.
<s> Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
<s> Well? How'd she do?
<s> That right.
<s> Cash.
<s> Sure.
<s> Look, uh... Creighton...
<s> OK. Take your coat, Ann?
<s> Mm.
<s> Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
<s> So?
<s> I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...
<s> ...who among us is in a position to say...
<s> ...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway...
<s> So, who should I--
<s> I'm fine. Thanks.
<s> Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
<s> Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
<s> Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> OK.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Not an owner.
<s> You'll go to the prison hospital.
<s> I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
<s> Where's the walk-in safe?
<s> Hurry up!
<s> Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
<s> Call me Vince.
<s> So the method of death is the only connection?
<s> You're kidding.
<s> I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.
<s> May I see that?
<s> There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
<s> I'd say we're in its home.
<s> Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
<s> I don't believe it.
<s> I'm not giving up.
<s> Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
<s> That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
<s> Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."
<s> It's like ringing the dinner bell.
<s> Yes.  John made quite a study of the whole museum.  He had a copy of my original plans.
<s> Read it out loud.
<s> Not really.  Just the sub-basement.
<s> Footsteps!
<s> I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
<s> Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
<s> Keep the light up.  I can't see.
<s> Frock's been fired.
<s> Eats them?
<s> What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
<s> I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
<s> You were behind me?  Running after me?
<s> All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
<s> When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
<s> Gone.
<s> Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
<s> Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
<s> You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
<s> He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
<s> What have we missed?
<s> What music?
<s> Amnesia.
<s> No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.
<s> And it's all available in the "Truman" Show" catalogue.  Operators are standing by.
<s> We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.  As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.
<s> I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
<s> It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
<s> --I'm not allowed to talk to you.
<s> Now.
<s> If we don't go now, it won't happen.
<s> So when are you leaving?
<s> How about them?
<s> Truman?  It's me, Marlon.  I need to talk to you.
<s> I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
<s> Oh, my God!
<s> I don't know--
<s> Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
<s> Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
<s> It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man.  And you know what else was really strange?  A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
<s> I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
<s> --How do you know about that?
<s> I don't understand.
<s> You're not FBI agents.
<s> Does what?
<s> Sorry. Don't have one.
<s> Me?
<s> Yes.
<s> Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
<s> Looking for him for what?
<s> What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
<s> Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
<s> And one little boy.
<s> They want to discredit you -- for what?
<s> Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
<s> How?
<s> You can't.
<s> Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
<s> What did it look like?
<s> Yeah, well I don't have them all.
<s> The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
<s> No you didn't.
<s> Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
<s> All I told them was the truth.
<s> They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
<s> I can't really talk right now.
<s> Mulder --
<s> Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
<s> I don't know why I think they went right.
<s> General McAddie's.
<s> I don't know anything about that.
<s> I've got to find Scully.
<s> What happened to Kurtzweil?
<s> I have answers for you.
<s> A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
<s> No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
<s> I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg.
<s> The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
<s> Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
<s> I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
<s> A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
<s> What happened?
<s> Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
<s> Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
<s> Do you think that's funny?
<s> What did you see?
<s> Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
<s> What happened to Charles Gish?
<s> Little boy?!  That's him!
<s> I can't leave him!
<s> It doesn't matter...
<s> No problem.
<s> That hoist, with the winch...
<s> They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
<s> Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
<s> No.
<s> Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
<s> It's his dog.
<s> Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
<s> Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
<s> They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
<s> Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
<s> Considering where I've been...
<s> He has a little dog.
<s> The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
<s> Dr. Winkel.
<s> Tell you what?
<s> I'm so sorry.
<s> Yes.
<s> Me.
<s> There isn't enough for two laughs.
<s> Of course.
<s> No.
<s> It's true then?
<s> Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
<s> Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
<s> It wasn't petrol.
<s> I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
<s> A bruised lip.
<s> I would like a word with this orderly Harbin.
<s> Bring him in.
<s> I'm not asking you to.
<s> Well?...
<s> We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
<s> I said you win.
<s> Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
<s> Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
<s> Never heard of him.
<s> You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
<s> You've got plenty of contacts.
<s> Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
<s> I understand...
<s> What's he saying?
<s> Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
<s> Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.
<s> A friend of mine offered me a job here.
<s> Richard. Hi.
<s> I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Why?
<s> Fuck off.
<s> Two.
<s> We swim.
<s> No.
<s> So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
<s> Richard, you know something -
<s> I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
<s> Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
<s> How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
<s> Why the fuck not?
<s> I have a job.
<s> I just read it....
<s> I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
<s> You weren't complaining about my play last time.
<s> No.
<s> I stole it. From a synagogue.
<s> Don't curse in front of it.
<s> Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter.
<s> And be crushed.
<s> People hate Jews. Do you agree?
<s> No, but deep down, beneath the "tolerance" they learn on television, nothing's changed. The very word makes their skin crawl.  It isn't even hate, really. It's more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor. We want to step on it. Crush it. We don't even know why. It's a physical reaction. Everyone feels it.
<s> I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
<s> They're liars and cowards.
<s> That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
<s> Female...
<s> He has Israel.
<s> Do you know who you're fucking with here?
<s> Listen to me....
<s> To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
<s> No.
<s> You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
<s> That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
<s> With the shoes... There was more than one?
<s> But I wasn't.
<s> Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
<s> Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
<s> What kids?...
<s> What...?
<s> It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
<s> I'm not hungry.... Come on, let's drive around.... We don't want to be spotted here.
<s> Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
<s> Why me?
<s> Four. But no one this important.
<s> Dennis Leary.
<s> No.
<s> Funny?
<s> Eat shit....
<s> Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
<s> ... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
<s> Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
<s> What d'you mean?
<s> The documents are forged.
<s> We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
<s> Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
<s> Yes.
<s> What was he like, when he was little?
<s> Okay.
<s> No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!
<s> Lira?
<s> Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.
<s> Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
<s> "That"!  This is not a "that"...
<s> It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
<s> Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
<s> I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
<s> What?
<s> Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
<s> Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
<s> If we don't... I'm going to beat you.
<s> I don't want to erase anything.
<s> I can't.
<s> Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
<s> ... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
<s> I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo.  I work for an insurance company.  So, I decided to take a few days off.  I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
<s> I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
<s> ... The way she moves.
<s> Uh... Yes, of course!
<s> I didn't dive.
<s> ... Nothing.
<s> It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
<s> I saw how it has to be.
<s> That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
<s> No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
<s> Johana... New York.
<s> Why is he doing this?
<s> I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
<s> You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
<s> One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The...
<s> What's up?
<s> He's...he's very nice.  But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.
<s> Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?
<s> I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
<s> Mordechai!
<s> Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother.
<s> Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
<s> ...I'm not finished yet, mom.
<s> What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you are!
<s> A stereo type alarm system?
<s> Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
<s> In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.
<s> While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
<s> I don't know -
<s> What about me?
<s> Where? Where did you find it?
<s> What arroyo - how did you get to it 
<s> They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
<s> When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
<s> You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
<s> No. I'm quite sure.
<s> Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
<s> It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
<s> But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
<s> Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
<s> Just barely possible - - yes.
<s> I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
<s> It's better you don't know.
<s> No - really, I can see them -- they're coming now - turn off the lights 
<s> Something's wrong with this whole setup --
<s> I know all that, chief, and I don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else --
<s> Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
<s> The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
<s> Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
<s> I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes majordomo. They are expecting you.
<s> I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
<s> Disney! How inter...
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Perhaps I should come back when youre...
<s> Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
<s> You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
<s> W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
<s> Sorry?
<s> Why... I dont know what youre talking about.
<s> My brother hung himself.
<s> If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why dont you accuse me of killing my brother?
<s> Leon could still have hung himself.
<s> Good.
<s> Why do I feel I neednt answer that?
<s> You bastard...
<s> ...Were turning in circles.
<s> Something like that.
<s> Here we go again.
<s> Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. Thats when he hit me, and told me hed killed my brother... You dont know what youve done, he said.  Were in deep trouble, he said. We, he said. We.  Wed both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
<s> On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
<s> Yes. Im trying to reach a friend but I cant get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
<s> Croissants.
<s> No. A poor little rich boy who thought hed save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
<s> How come youre alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
<s> That-that wont do. Thats not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, thats the way...
<s> You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
<s> Huh! And they say charitys only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...
<s> Thats right. Wheres the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?
<s> Shell be alright. Shes tough...
<s> May I have your phone number?
<s> What sort have you got?
<s> Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
<s> What?
<s> What kids?
<s> The company. We all work for the company.
<s> Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
<s> Good.
<s> Well, I hope youre not too heartbroken and...
<s> Bye bye, Jane. And dont be naughty.
<s> What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
<s> Do what, Mr Lombard?
<s> Anything at all?
<s> No. In Hampstead... Why?
<s> Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
<s> Youre making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guys not one of Friedmans...
<s> We need a double-room and as I understand youre here alone wed be much obliged if youd agree to move to a single room...
<s> I dont recollect mentioning a friend.
<s> Questions can amount to revelations. Now, Id hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
<s> Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
<s> How are you, Rhian?
<s> His mother would be pleased to hear that.
<s> Do you know Leons parents names?
<s> My sister... She lives in the next valley.
<s> Oh, I... She just moved. Ive got her new... Its in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
<s> Fucked-up fucking weird.
<s> Un Autrichien. Negociant en pr- pubescents.
<s> Cinq cents.
<s> Thats just it. The sonofabitch didnt ask for help from his colleagues...  Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you... He hasnt gone to hell too soon... And neither will you, Mr Lamont!
<s> What do you think, huh?
<s> Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldnt go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
<s> Thats the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to, eh, French-fuck?
<s> I can only tell you what he told us...
<s> Thats what he said...
<s> It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as Never Forget. Over the years were talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
<s> Very generous of you all.  How much?
<s> Jeanne's been badly injured!  She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!
<s> We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
<s> No.  I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
<s> Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
<s> But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.
<s> Jeanne, no...
<s> So... what am I supposed to do now?
<s> I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
<s> I -- I don't understand...
<s> I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
<s> Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
<s> I tried to.
<s> Scared of a girl?
<s> Am I... am I dead?
<s> Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
<s> I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
<s> What about you?
<s> But where are you going to be?
<s> You have nothing to regret...
<s> Silence her!  Take her away...!
<s> He's feeling wonderful.
<s> What difference does it make where she comes from?
<s> ... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone.
<s> There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
<s> Noooo!
<s> 20,000 gold crowns.
<s> Yes... they were.
<s> Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
<s> You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
<s> Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
<s> We're taking back the Tourelles!
<s> As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
<s> Me too...
<s> No good?  This is a disaster!
<s> But the bridge has been pulled down!
<s> I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
<s> The clothes are not important...
<s> Yes, but...
<s> No!
<s> Why not?  He has good teeth...
<s> Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
<s> Don't swear...
<s> ... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
<s> Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
<s> Five steeds and a few hackneys...
<s> And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
<s> Nothing.  I'm here to set you free...
<s> No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
<s> They're going to come and visit you in here?
<s> Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
<s> No...
<s> I need to confess again.
<s> Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
<s> He never says his name.
<s> Jeanne, be patient.
<s> It's like this... I...we...all of them.
<s> You can't, it's too dangerous.
<s> Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
<s> American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
<s> What's happened?
<s> What, I'm working, what?
<s> Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
<s> They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
<s> Do they?
<s> What's the matter with you all? Have you lost your sense of humour?
<s> Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
<s> Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
<s> You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
<s> Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
<s> You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
<s> Yes, that's why I brought it.
<s> Toilets?
<s> You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
<s> I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
<s> Bitch!
<s> You're a dirty pig!
<s> It's a little cut, nothing.
<s> Sorry, I don't remember.
<s> In the attic.
<s> Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
<s> Watch your feet!
<s> To be deaf?
<s> ... without a shred of manners.
<s> That is good, yes.
<s> Baines is packing up?
<s> Ohhh ... dear. Not another word From the shock, yes it would be.
<s> I'd like to make a swap.
<s> I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
<s> Te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci.  UNSUBTITLED
<s> No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
<s> I just want to listen.
<s> Who told ya this guy was in here?
<s> You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
<s> I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
<s> He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
<s> Hell no, I just cut into him.  I woulda settled for pawning one of them shoes.
<s> All of it.
<s> But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
<s> You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
<s> They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
<s> Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
<s> The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way.
<s> You sure he didn't just pocket it?
<s> Yes sir.
<s> You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
<s> You mean you blew it.
<s> I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
<s> Why?
<s> What do ya mean?
<s> No, not a thing.
<s> Yeh.
<s> Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
<s> But I got a train to make.
<s> What the hell for?
<s> You move right along, don't ya.
<s> You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.
<s> Okay, Tootsie.
<s> I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
<s> I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
<s> That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
<s> I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
<s> Why don't ya then.
<s> He's right, Les.
<s> On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
<s> Never heard of the place.
<s> Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
<s> Sorry.  Don't know a thing.
<s> Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
<s> Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
<s> Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
<s> He's just around the corner.
<s> You've got to get your mind off this.
<s> I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
<s> Now do you believe me!
<s> We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
<s> Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
<s> It's a promise?
<s> He's all right.
<s> Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
<s> I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
<s> We were looking for this bird.
<s> Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
<s> No.
<s> Nunheim!
<s> Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
<s> I'll take care of him.
<s> Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
<s> No.
<s> That's nothing.  I saw him myself.
<s> I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
<s> I guess all the suspects are here.
<s> What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
<s> Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
<s> supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
<s> Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
<s> So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
<s> But suppose some business comes up...
<s> I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
<s> Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
<s> He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
<s> Hello, Mimi.
<s> They'll want more than your word for that.
<s> You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
<s> Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
<s> Santa Claus.
<s> There's nothing I can do to help her.
<s> Someone get a doctor.
<s> You talk as if I were Asta.
<s> I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
<s> We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
<s> I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
<s> He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.
<s> Sure I will.
<s> He was down in the shop.
<s> I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.
<s> No.  Nobody but you.
<s> I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
<s> Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
<s> After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a brilliant idea.  He realized that he and Julia could still collect money.  Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant's name, so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia.  He even telephoned Macaulay --  Do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?
<s> Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
<s> Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right -- 
<s> Home!
<s> Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.
<s> I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
<s> We're going to keep driving.
<s> Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
<s> I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
<s> For climbing.
<s> What do you figure it to be?
<s> I heard!
<s> What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
<s> Why'd he come in our camp.
<s> How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
<s> You said he was a deserter.
<s> He's an enemy soldier.
<s> No.
<s> Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
<s> Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
<s> Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
<s> There might be something in there.
<s> OH MY GOD!
<s> Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?
<s> We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
<s> It's the only way.  We drive!
<s> I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
<s> Faster we get there, faster we get back.
<s> Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
<s> Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
<s> The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
<s> So where do we start?
<s> I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
<s> It's giving.
<s> What?
<s> It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
<s> We'll find our way.
<s> Yeah.  Well, me too.
<s> Damn.
<s> No!
<s> We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
<s> I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
<s> We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
<s> With what?  Against how many?
<s> Then I'm a rich man.
<s> How the hell should I know?
<s> What?
<s> Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
<s> A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal?
<s> I could use some recon photos too.
<s> They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
<s> I thought it would be good to know.
<s> Now you need me.
<s> Naw, nothing.
<s> I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.
<s> Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
<s> It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
<s> It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
<s> A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
<s> You have to go with us, Wes.
<s> Yeah, we're down.
<s> We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
<s> Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
<s> 4732...?
<s> No, evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. Secure another sinex drop.
<s> I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.
<s> You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
<s> I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
<s> What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.
<s> What?
<s> But...you...
<s> You don't know.  You don't....
<s> We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
<s> It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.
<s> I was lost.
<s> No!....
<s> -Where?
<s> Anything else I should know?
<s> Oh yeah? Prove it.
<s> Then let's go see what they missed.
<s> Sounds like terrorist heaven.
<s> Just how easy is it to build a... device?
<s> Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...
<s> I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things... 
<s> Be right back.
<s> We work fast enough for you?
<s> Hey, I'm next.
<s> Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
<s> A bowling alley.
<s> We've created a monster.
<s> We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
<s> Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
<s> Shit. We're fucked.
<s> What?
<s> Huh?
<s> He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
<s> Goddamit, Reilly--
<s> My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
<s> I promised her she'd be safe.
<s> Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
<s> No!  But let me tell you--any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag--phooey, phooey, phooey!
<s> In a moment.
<s> erect in sweater, arms folded.
<s> I said, "Come in." And there he was. A fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, "Good evening. I'm the doctor." I said, "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."
<s> I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
<s> Good morning.  I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some cuff links.
<s> If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
<s> Yes, Baron.
<s> Um-hum ...
<s> You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
<s> No, thank you.
<s> I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.
<s> We'll take the Royal Suite!
<s> Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doa Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
<s> <u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
<s> Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!
<s> Lily-- 
<s> Oh!
<s> That sounds sensible. 
<s> Together.
<s> Hair?
<s> Talk? About me--about us?
<s> Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
<s> Because I want to make it tough for you.
<s> Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
<s> I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
<s> I don't want your money!
<s> Well, where is it?
<s> About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.
<s> I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
<s> Don't you mean work me?
<s> That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
<s> There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.  Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
<s> You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
<s> I was tired.
<s> No caviar for me, thanks.  Never did like it much.
<s> Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.
<s> I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
<s> Bollocks.
<s> Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go.  Well come on!
<s> No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
<s> Could I speak to you in private?
<s> Jack.
<s> Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
<s> Sure. If you like.
<s> Sssshh. Come here.
<s> A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.
<s> He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
<s> Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
<s> I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.
<s> Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
<s> That's enough.
<s> Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
<s> You had it the entire time?!
<s> Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
<s> Do you want the truth, Anya?
<s> I didn't ask you to come away with me--
<s> Will you leave me alone?
<s> Baloney!
<s> Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
<s> Glad to see you again.
<s> Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
<s> Montana?
<s> Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
<s> --sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
<s> Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
<s> You asked me to dine with you tonight.
<s> Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
<s> Make it five.
<s> Shortie, look!
<s> I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
<s> You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
<s> Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
<s> Where did you hide it?
<s> No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
<s> Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
<s> I wouldn't be surprised--
<s> Sure, I'll go.
<s> Thanks. That makes us square.
<s> How?
<s> Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
<s> Sure.
<s> June? That's my wife's name.
<s> Sure.
<s> No. <U>Knots</U>!
<s> This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
<s> It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
<s> He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
<s> Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
<s> What's he got that I haven't got?
<s> So what?
<s> Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
<s> Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
<s> Good-night, folks.
<s> About twelve hundred.
<s> It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
<s> I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
<s> What's the matter?
<s> What!--are you crazy?
<s> Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst.  Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call.  Cover your ears, darling.
<s> Not now.  I don't have time.
<s> Easy, son.  You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All.  Come on, boy, let's kick South.  Down to the old playground.
<s> Oh, Jesus, Johnny...
<s> Well... 'bye.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Better.
<s> But who was the Devil?
<s> Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
<s> In vino veritas.
<s> A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
<s> What does he want?  He wants revenge.
<s> Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
<s> All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
<s> There's no reasoning with him.
<s> Good God, you're really-
<s> I know.  Me neither.
<s> Easy now... That mare's in season.
<s> They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
<s> You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
<s> Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.
<s> Where do you get these questions?
<s> Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
<s> You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman?
<s> Drop his horse.
<s> I know, kid.  I know.  Me too.
<s> Sure...
<s> Acquired?
<s> Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.
<s> Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...
<s> You are the one, Wyatt.  You sure are.
<s> Wyatt...
<s> Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
<s> I wonder if it runs in the family.
<s> What about the gold?
<s> Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
<s> Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.
<s> Is this another one of your games?
<s> Do you?
<s> Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
<s> Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
<s> Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
<s> Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
<s> Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
<s> I didn't think so.
<s> The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.
<s> No. I'm going with you.
<s> My father left me the business.
<s> Yes, M.
<s> Of course.
<s> Good luck on your mission, 007.
<s> Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
<s> It doesn't quite add up.
<s> Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
<s> Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
<s> Fueled and waiting.
<s> Yes. Shall we kill them?
<s> Who is it?
<s> No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
<s> Junior spends time with his child.
<s> Yes.
<s> What is a sip of coffee going to do?
<s> Why in the h...
<s> Like muddy waters?
<s> Do you think you won?
<s> Babe Brother.
<s> This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
<s> Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
<s> Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
<s> This would be a bad time for me to leave.
<s> Now how far would further out be?
<s> Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
<s> Go back to sleep.
<s> Just stay in bed and rest.
<s> You stay inside. I will see to them.
<s> I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
<s> You better come sit down. You are still sick.
<s> I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
<s> Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
<s> It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
<s> She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
<s> He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
<s> You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
<s> What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
<s> Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
<s> Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
<s> Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.
<s> I already have, my dear.
<s> What's a toby?
<s> I thought you weren't old fashioned.
<s> Don't shout!
<s> Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
<s> You know the man next door is near death.
<s> Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
<s> No, I haven't seen him.
<s> Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
<s> But what if we leave them behind?
<s> Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
<s> See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
<s> HO-YAAAHH!!!
<s> Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
<s> T-O-Y.  Toy.
<s> Sorry.
<s> Where is it?  I don't see the --
<s> Alright Buzz, get ready...
<s> Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
<s> We've got to get out of here...NOW.
<s> Woody!
<s> Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
<s> Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
<s> Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
<s> I can't see a thing!
<s> Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
<s> No, I'm not!  Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
<s> Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
<s> I thought he was at summer camp!
<s> Oh, I don't like confrontations.
<s> I can't quite make out -- 
<s> Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
<s> Got it.
<s> We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
<s> Home is where the heart is.
<s> We're too young.
<s> I want to believe you.  I really do.
<s> Please.  Tell me who Carl sells to.
<s> We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences.
<s> The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
<s> Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too.
<s> I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
<s> Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
<s> I don't know.
<s> So's the video camera.
<s> How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
<s> Like I give a fuck.
<s> What is this, like freebase?
<s> She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
<s> You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.
<s> Not Tiger Woods.
<s> I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
<s> That thought makes me feel awful.
<s> You're breaking my heart.
<s> Yes, sir!
<s> I don't know, sir.
<s> But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.
<s> I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
<s> It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
<s> I don't know.  Something.
<s> She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
<s> The police won't find your car.
<s> But will he be house-trained?
<s> It could mean that, yes.
<s> I have money --
<s> Just tell me where she is.
<s> We sometimes went downtown to score.
<s> I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
<s> Yes, I hope so as well.
<s> The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
<s> It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
<s> It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
<s> Aye, OK, Fr.  But the good times couldn't last for ever.
<s> Jesus.
<s> Did you bring the cards?
<s> And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.
<s> Certainly not.
<s> Are you clean?
<s> Smells like it.
<s> So why have you told me about it?
<s> Sixteen next month.
<s> Sorry about last night -
<s> Yeah.
<s> Nightmare.
<s> One hundred and sixteen minutes.
<s> But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
<s> So who else?
<s> It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
<s> Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
<s> you'll need one more hit.
<s> It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
<s> Went ballistic?
<s> I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.
<s> Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
<s> Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
<s> Rescued at last.
<s> All right, we're lost.  But we're making good time.
<s> Pavel.
<s> Raise shields.
<s> Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
<s> Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
<s> I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
<s> Join my quest.
<s> I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
<s> Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
<s> Go, Sulu.
<s> I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
<s> Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
<s> Fascinating.
<s> Yes, Captain?
<s> An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him.
<s> Captain, what have I done -
<s> Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
<s> You ordered me to kill my brother.
<s> He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
<s> He did have pointed ears.
<s> But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
<s> If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
<s> I believe we are witnessing my birth.
<s> No conditions.
<s> Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
<s> Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
<s> I hide no pain.
<s> Do you?
<s> "Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
<s> You haven't told him?
<s> Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
<s> To warn him.
<s> Alan. Alan Bailey.
<s> oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
<s> We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
<s> Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
<s> It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
<s> Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
<s> I'm sorry -
<s> The Pentagon?
<s> What do you want with the Pentagon?
<s> You wouldn't dare.
<s> Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --
<s> Hah.
<s> They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
<s> Yes.
<s> Why? What are you going to do?
<s> Tron...?
<s> PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
<s> We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
<s> Come here.
<s> Little more juice's all it needs...
<s> Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know...
<s> Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
<s> Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
<s> I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
<s> You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
<s> We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
<s> Then I owe you some thanks...
<s> Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
<s> Yeah, right.
<s> What?
<s> Right.  She's only fourteen.
<s> No way.  Not Dana.
<s> She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
<s> And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.
<s> Okay.  Here she comes.
<s> You want me to just hang-- ?
<s> What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
<s> I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed.
<s> In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
<s> ... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
<s> Here they come.
<s> Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
<s> I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
<s> It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
<s> He needed my help.
<s> Well, maybe a little.
<s> You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I suggest you cooperate.  If we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us.
<s> You will be contacted with the assignment.
<s> What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
<s> Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
<s> Don't call me honey!  You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?!  You pig!
<s> What about Juno?
<s> Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
<s> Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
<s> Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
<s> Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
<s> It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
<s> Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
<s> Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
<s> It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
<s> The oriental.
<s> Want some Goobers?
<s> I thought Sonny was the good guy.
<s> Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
<s> What do you do?
<s> Where are you from.
<s> Very much. Now, where were we?
<s> What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
<s> Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
<s> Almost four years.
<s> Five.
<s> What would make you think that?
<s> Thank you.
<s> What?
<s> No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
<s> Can you live with it?
<s> I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
<s> She's with me.
<s> Has he gotten his mail today?
<s> Where?
<s> Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.
<s> In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
<s> No problems on both counts.
<s> Yeah?
<s> The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.
<s> Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
<s> Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
<s> Thank you very much, Clarence.
<s> Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.
<s> I got some money I can give you -
<s> Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -
<s> Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
<s> Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.
<s> Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.
<s> How the fuck could he know?
<s> You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
<s> Pussy love pink rocks.
<s> Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.
<s> Read my lips.
<s> Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
<s> Are you Dick Ritchie?
<s> No.
<s> Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
<s> Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
<s> Meaning...???
<s> So that...???
<s> I have to go.
<s> This is April, right?
<s> We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
<s> It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me.
<s> I did him a favor.  Now come on.
<s> I've got one now.
<s> I thought you didn't know how to drive.
<s> Shot!  Who shot you?
<s> No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
<s> I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.
<s> Give me the gun.
<s> No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
<s> I don't know -- I don't remember.
<s> James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
<s> I...I...We need cash, James.
<s> Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
<s> I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
<s> No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, "voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.
<s> What's that mean?
<s> Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
<s> I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
<s> Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
<s> The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
<s> It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
<s> Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
<s> Were you listening?  We got two officers in the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.
<s> You want to go in?  Examine him?
<s> On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
<s> I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
<s> Christ no!
<s> I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
<s> Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
<s> Think you'll live that long?
<s> More or less.
<s> Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?
<s> Harlin around?
<s> So?
<s> You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
<s> Don't look like nothing.
<s> She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
<s> Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
<s> Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
<s> What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
<s> You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?
<s> 'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
<s> Yes.  Yes it is.
<s> I had a fight with Jake.  I . . . I just wanted to get away for awhile. Mr. Stewart was kind enough to take me as far as Montrose.  I'm going to take a bus to my sister's.  I thought I'd stay with her for a few days.
<s> John . . .
<s> What do you want?
<s> John--
<s> I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
<s> They look nice.
<s> There's someone in the house.
<s> I'm just going to my car.
<s> You sure you can manage?
<s> You should be more careful.
<s> No trouble at all, really.
<s> Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
<s> I guess I've got wander in my blood.
<s> Thank you.
<s> A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
<s> Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
<s> You know what I want.
<s> If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
<s> You could just leave him.
<s> From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
<s> I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
<s> Because I know you're full of shit.
<s> The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
<s> I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
<s> Not me.  Us.
<s> You could give me the gun.
<s> He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.
<s> But I want to say with you,
<s> Grace!
<s> It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
<s> Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
<s> That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
<s> Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
<s> I do.
<s> The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
<s> Came close this time and it scares you.
<s> Christ, Jake, please--
<s> You're not talking sense.
<s> Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
<s> Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
<s> Oz.
<s> You're too quick for me.
<s> How old are you?
<s> Will you shut up!
<s> You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
<s> Oh, shit!
<s> You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
<s> With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?
<s> No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
<s> Wouldn't know anything about it.
<s> Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
<s> Thirty-thousand dollars.
<s> Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
<s> But, Senor--
<s> Senor, you need a doctor.
<s> You want something, old man?
<s> All right, old man.  Christ.
<s> Christ!
<s> Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
<s> Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
<s> That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
<s> You expect me to believe that?
<s> Mister, I'm calling you out.
<s> 'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
<s> Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
<s> I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
<s> That's a solid name.
<s> Darrell's a moron.
<s> That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  Eh?
<s> How do you know if you've never tried?
<s> About things.  About your wife.
<s> I do.
<s> You're talking like a madman.
<s> Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
<s> What?
<s> I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
<s> Oz.
<s> 'Cause Harlin used to own it.
<s> Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...
<s> Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
<s> You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
<s> Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
<s> Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
<s> That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
<s> You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
<s> That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
<s> I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
<s> Darrell.
<s> Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
<s> Open up!
<s> Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
<s> Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
<s> My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
<s> Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
<s> What happened to your hand?
<s> Did you like it; me watching you?
<s> Nothing like a little liveliness.
<s> Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
<s> I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
<s> You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
<s> Nothing I understand better than a mess.
<s> He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
<s> ...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here.
<s> If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
<s> After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
<s> You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
<s> <u>I don't know why</u>!
<s> My mother died in this canyon.
<s> But we all need that too. Hold him.
<s> 'Cause I love you.
<s> And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
<s> With a <u>shotgun</u>!  She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?
<s> The ticket is 30.55.
<s> No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
<s> No baby, you got it wrong.
<s> Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
<s> Like you helped her, Jake?
<s> Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
<s> Is Noel in?
<s> Wow.
<s> Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
<s> No that's it.
<s> You use your sleeve.
<s> He's dealing with a lot of things.  I think he needs to find answers himself.
<s> My turn. What's your favorite song?
<s> What was your idea Elijah?
<s> You thought he was carrying a knife?
<s> One last question.
<s> Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
<s> Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
<s> I mean if you knew karate?
<s> I lied.
<s> Fine.
<s> I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
<s> Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
<s> We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
<s> Nope.
<s> You ain't dead.
<s> On the Bar T... looking for... them.
<s> Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
<s> Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
<s> You want... a free one.
<s> I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
<s> She back in Kansas?
<s> Oh.
<s> You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies?
<s> You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
<s> You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
<s> And?
<s> About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
<s> Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.
<s> Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
<s> I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
<s> Huh?
<s> He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
<s> Lookin' at?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
<s> Lemmee see it.
<s> You better get on back, Miss.
<s> Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
<s> Yeah.
<s> We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
<s> Sally?
<s> You ain't like that no more.
<s> Beats the hell out of me.
<s> I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
<s> Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.
<s> I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river.  He's a snake, he got... snake eyes.
<s> Best we move that pig.
<s> Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
<s> How many you killed, Kid?
<s> You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
<s> They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
<s> + The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;
<s> I'm having a stroke.
<s> Just forget about it.
<s> Alright.
<s> I hope I didn't disturb you.
<s> A glass of water would be nice.
<s> Umm ...
<s> I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
<s> They fucking know everything.
<s> What do you care what he says?
<s> Did you hear what he just said?
<s> County. I was in for fraud.
<s> They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.
<s> Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
<s> Russian, I think. I don't know.
<s> I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
<s> Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
<s> Mr. Soze will be most -
<s> A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
<s> You know damn well what I think.
<s> I told the D.A. everything I know.
<s> I just want to hear your story.
<s> I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
<s> No.
<s> Why didn't you say anything?
<s> Then why didn't you help him?
<s> I don't
<s> He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
<s> I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
<s> Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
<s> She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
<s> Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
<s> You thought it was just.
<s> I was her doctor.
<s> ...I was one of a group of...
<s> Tell me one?
<s> She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
<s> Yes!
<s> That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
<s> Through, through his book.
<s> `Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
<s> Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
<s> Yes.
<s> Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
<s> No, you did fine.
<s> Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
<s> Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?
<s> I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
<s> You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
<s> That happens.
<s> What?
<s> I understand.  Thank you, my name is Galvin.  I'll be at the following number in a half an hour.  It's urgent.
<s> Maybe what?
<s> And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
<s> What...?
<s> Isn't there something you...
<s> You're talking like a drunk.
<s> And what makes you so tough?
<s> If I don't 'grow up...'
<s> What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
<s> What do you want?
<s> Right.
<s> D'you find the obstetric nurse?
<s> I'm going to see you get that chance.
<s> You live in the neighborhood?
<s> How old is he?
<s> Mrs...
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yes.
<s> Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
<s> Huh.  And why is that?
<s> Should I?
<s> Yes.
<s> Ah? That complicates the problem.
<s> I married into it.
<s> No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
<s> I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
<s> That's Carlotta Valdes.
<s> Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
<s> You're not far wrong.
<s> Why?!
<s> Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
<s> I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh, no. You'll muss me.
<s> I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free.
<s> What are you going to do?
<s> At...
<s> Where had you been before?
<s> This afternoon.
<s> Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
<s> My name is John Ferguson.
<s> What?
<s> Good-bye.
<s> If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
<s> Only silence. It's always like this.
<s> Madeleine!
<s> Here with you.
<s> Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
<s> What?!
<s> And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
<s> Yesterday.
<s> A grave...
<s> No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
<s> And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
<s> Not merely as it was a hundred years ago. As it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it.  Madeleine, think of when you were here!
<s> It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
<s> Madeleine!!
<s> Yes.
<s> I won't lose you.
<s> Carlotta Valdes?
<s> When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
<s> I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
<s> Would you please go and look?
<s> Oh!
<s> I've never run across one like that.
<s> Normal.
<s> You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
<s> How?
<s> I'll take you home.
<s> You haven't told me everything.
<s> Think?  Well, what do you think?
<s> Carlotta?
<s> All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
<s> What is it, a still life?
<s> By whom?
<s> Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
<s> But you said grey, sir.
<s> Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
<s> Don't touch her. Call 911.
<s> You're interrupting a personal conversation.
<s> You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
<s> They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
<s> You don't know what you're doing.
<s> I'm calling the ambulance.
<s> Calling the ambulance.
<s> We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
<s> I'm not wrecking the transmission!
<s> I can't do this.
<s> I don't give a damn.
<s> Adam! Calm down.
<s> No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
<s> What?
<s> I don't think so.
<s> There's more.
<s> Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
<s> Sweet deal.
<s> Well, I didn't mean it.
<s> Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
<s> Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
<s> I'm calling the police.
<s> I think we should say some words over the grave.
<s> No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
<s> However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
<s> What did you ask me?
<s> What are you going to do?
<s> You're sick.
<s> The hell you didn't!
<s> And what happens when you can't?
<s> What's your point?
<s> What? What's your point?
<s> They need leadership.
<s> Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
<s> Goosed!
<s> How about my Fatburger?
<s> It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.
<s> I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
<s> Sent it.
<s> Yup.
<s> I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
<s> I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
<s> Well it's bad timing.
<s> You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
<s> It's vile!
<s> I've seen it on television.
<s> I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
<s> I'll call them from the road.
<s> I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
<s> Are they fighting?
<s> I won't even discuss it.
<s> Yeah. You.
<s> No it's not okay. It's not.
<s> But...
<s> You put him down or don't bother coming back.
<s> You did all right dad.
<s> I just want her to be happy.
<s> He's your brother.
<s> Go for it.
<s> Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
<s> At the newsstand on 3rd.
<s> The wahoo moment?
<s> I think so.
<s> What is it?
<s> Greenpeace?
<s> Downstairs in the closet.
<s> That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.
<s> Where?
<s> Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
<s> It's a present from my parents.
<s> Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
<s> Evil.
<s> You must listen to me before you go.
<s> Yes, sir. Good night.
<s> I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
<s> Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
<s> But what can I say to her, sir?
<s> That's it.
<s> Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
<s> Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
<s> That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
<s> But you have a right to let us know what you think.
<s> I'm not like you, you have your wife.
<s> Leave him alone.
<s> I'll be ready.
<s> Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
<s> Mother.
<s> I've had a gutful of this.
<s> Today, a good girl.
<s> Can you tell us what's on the disc?
<s> I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
<s> He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
<s> He was a computer program for crissake.
<s> If you can catch him.
<s> Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
<s> You think he's smart?
<s> If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.
<s> If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.
<s> It feels so.. .real.
<s> This is supposed to be years away.
<s> Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
<s> It was me, what?
<s> Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
<s> What do you expect me to do, thank him?
<s> Of course you are.
<s> Help me get out of here.
<s> Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
<s> Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
<s> Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
<s> You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're readapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
<s> This is my area of expertise.
<s> Nothing.
<s> You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?
<s> Because this painintheass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
<s> Sid?
<s> I couldn't tell you.
<s> Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
<s> Why's that?
<s> You are going after Mayor Bennett.
<s> BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!
<s> At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
<s> <u>Hello</u>.  What?

Well, they think, she isn't Jewish, but she's well to-do, a nice old family.  Alright, yes, they say.  We would consider such an offer.  Wonderful, matchmaker says, My Job is Half Done.

<s> Finish Strong!  Are you <u>nuts</u>?  Are you nuts?  This's Pennies from <u>Heaven</u>... on his triumphal return home, Old Shoe, his Plane Forced Down...AND YET...
<s> He raped a <u>Nun</u>...
<s> "...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
<s> They'll be here in ten minutes.
<s> That's <u>one</u> thing, but I'm not gonna let two dickheads from <u>Filmschool</u> take it... are you <u>Nuts</u>?  Are you <u>Nuts</u>?
<s> Where are we on the Image?  Grace?  <u>Grace</u>...
<s> Why are they ...
<s> It's a <u>beret</u>...
<s> ...they... <u>you</u> know...
<s> Cause the beans, y'know, y'can tell if they're <u>puttin</u> stuff in it.
<s> Show some compassion.
<s> How 'bout a Cold Drink...?
<s> What about tipping off Yurovich?
<s> Sounds like a french word, what is it?
<s> Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
<s> Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?
<s> All right, I owe you one Marv.
<s> Then get out and close it behind you.
<s> Start unloading.
<s> Now! Tell everyone to dump!
<s> Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
<s> Not in here Dad... please. Later.
<s> Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. We'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need. We're gonna compete with the big boys now.
<s> Alright. Why so pissed?
<s> Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
<s> Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
<s> Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
<s> Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> ...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
<s> Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
<s> They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
<s> Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
<s> Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
<s> Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
<s> Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
<s> Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
<s> ...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
<s> Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
<s> I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
<s> No sir, that would've been illegal...
<s> Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!
<s> Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
<s> What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??
<s> Allright. Wait here...
<s> Yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon: rule one, capital reserves. This company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. That buys us a lot of credibility...  ...and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker...
<s> I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
<s> A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.
<s> Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
<s> Gordon.
<s> Aha. Poet or philosopher?
<s> ...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
<s> You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
<s> He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
<s> It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
<s> So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
<s> What the hell's that supposed to mean?
<s> It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
<s> Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
<s> You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
<s> Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.
<s> If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people.
<s> We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.
<s> Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
<s> Businessman!
<s> So why are you dating Jonathan?
<s> A body.  I mean we're talking major body
<s> Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.
<s> I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
<s> Thank you Jenkins
<s> Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
<s> No?
<s> Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
<s> They seemed, closing by much 
<s> Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
<s> Who's is all this?
<s> Safety in numbers man.
<s> So Mark, what's so urgent?
<s> Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
<s> I'll come back all the time.
<s> I know he does.
<s> Do you really think so?
<s> What does she look like?
<s> What do you think?  Guess.
<s> That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
<s> No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
<s> Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
<s> Um...
<s> Wait!  Don't go...
<s> No.  No, I don't.
<s> You must have been very proud.
<s> Of course.
<s> Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
<s> ...just so she could cut them off.
<s> Do we have to?
<s> So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
<s> ...no...no...no...
<s> No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
<s> I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
<s> He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
<s> We did.
<s> Yup.
<s> After that.
<s> I'd never be able to live with mysel--
<s> I know.
<s> In the house.  I was scared.
<s> Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
<s> And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
<s> ...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
<s> I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
<s> Then where is she?
<s> Yep.
<s> In the living room...
<s> Not personally.
<s> Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
<s> Get out of my way.
<s> How did she know where it was?
<s> We don't know that for sure.
<s> She can't be here without me.
<s> Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
<s> You don't have to do that.
<s> Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
<s> With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
<s> A spirit.  Perhaps evil...   ...and he has come to you- with Diedre gone - you've... inherited him.
<s> I don't want it.
<s> Then you wear it.
<s> When did she die...?
<s> Diedre Mayfair was your mother.
<s> I under5tand.  All the same
<s> I'm tired.  I need to rest.
<s> It wes a dream...!
<s> ENOUGH!!!
<s> You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
<s> You - are - a - murderer.
<s> Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
<s> Lie...?
<s> It's too soon to know.
<s> No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
<s> I don't know what you are!!!
<s> It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
<s> They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
<s> ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
<s> I'm glad you're around to say it.
<s> Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
<s> The one time I want it to work...
<s> Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
<s> I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
<s> You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
<s> Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha!
<s> What about you coming down here...?
<s> He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
<s> But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
<s> Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
<s> Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
<s> Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor.
<s> If you like that type.
<s> Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
<s> You really love this guy...?
<s> The one on the left - definitely...
<s> Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?
<s> BRIAN...
<s> Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
<s> That's right...
<s> No - I've been abroad for a long time...
<s> You don't know?
<s> I have something I have to show you...
<s> My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
<s> It was wrong - all my life I have been cheated - cheated of anything good - I shouldn't have been born - I was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me...
<s> Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
<s> Yes - I suppose so...
<s> There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
<s> Why whats wrong with the sugar -
<s> Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
<s> No he had to - he's just - he's out...
<s> Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
<s> Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
<s> Maybe he got promoted.
<s> Cut it out, before you break something!
<s> This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
<s> I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
<s> What is it now?
<s> ...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.
<s> Ladies first.  I insist.
<s> Yeah? You like?
<s> It's my private business! Mine!
<s> I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
<s> I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
<s> Some of them have to be automatics.
<s> I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
<s> Hang in there, I'll think of something.
<s> Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.
<s> Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!
<s> Very funny.
<s> You want it in writing?
<s> Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
<s> But you triple-dog-dared me.
<s> In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
<s> I'm trying to help.
<s> Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
<s> Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
<s> Is this an gritty expos or a candy ass press release?
<s> Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
<s> I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
<s> Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
<s> He didn't. He had it built.
<s> The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
<s> I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
<s> Amen to that.
<s> You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
<s> Not a chance.
<s> Maybe someday.
<s> That's hard to believe.
<s> Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
<s> No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
<s> Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
<s> Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
<s> I'll make you very proud.
<s> Forget the store. Think big.
<s> Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
<s> I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?
<s> Seldom? No kidding?
<s> Tipping?
<s> It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
<s> That's perfect.
<s> I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
<s> You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
<s> We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.
<s> People pay good money for that?
<s> It's about your parents.
<s> I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
<s> Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
<s> And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
<s> I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
<s> Take your time.
<s> He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
<s> I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
<s> Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
<s> Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
<s> Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
<s> Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah.  But I got my bike.
<s> I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
<s> Oh, for Christ's sake.
<s> I'm not on your property!
<s> Where, the mall?
<s> Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
<s> Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
<s> About six and a half million dollars.
<s> Stick?
<s> There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
<s> Okay.  I love you too.
<s> Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
<s> I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
<s> So Suzie, you called us, remember?
<s> Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
<s> Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
<s> But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
<s> Are you mad at me?
<s> That was the same thing Ray said.
<s> Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
<s> Shit. Here we go again.
<s> To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
<s> Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
<s> Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
<s> You need that real often?
<s> Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
<s> What about the explosive?
<s> Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
<s> Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
<s> I'm going to hit you.
<s> No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
<s> What way is that?
<s> I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
<s> Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
<s> It's not a guy...
<s> Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
<s> Oh, thank you.
<s> Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
<s> Really?
<s> Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
<s> Yes sir.
<s> This is Colonel Richards.
<s> Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
<s> Nicely said, sir.
<s> And?
<s> He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.
<s> No, sir... just a businessman.
<s> Who was this partner of his?
<s> Then come with us.
<s> I have no family.
<s> He's no magician.
<s> Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I hate this.
<s> These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
<s> Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
<s> My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
<s> She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
<s> Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
<s> Burn it to a fine ash.
<s> No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
<s> More!  More!
<s> Surrender!!
<s> Who??
<s> How are we going to get out there?
<s> The sorceress.
<s> Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
<s> Guess I'm not used to so much.
<s> That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
<s> I thought I was the English.
<s> I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
<s> Sure have, Sam.
<s> If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
<s> Johnny 
<s> Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
<s> We do not go into your courts.
<s> Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
<s> No, no doctor...
<s> Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
<s> Only the elders.
<s> Two days.
<s> Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
<s> Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
<s> I didn't even know about it.
<s> He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know  anybody who knows John  knows that's a goddamn lie!
<s> We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
<s> John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
<s> Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
<s> Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
<s> You'll be hist...
<s> Who are you?
<s> Are you all right, Dorothy?
<s> I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
<s> How did you guess?
<s> Oh, no -- no!
<s> No --
<s> Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
<s> ...Oh, did that hurt?
<s> Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
<s> Oh! Oh!
<s> Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
<s> Lions and tigers and bears!
<s> In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
<s> Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
<s> I have so got brains.
<s> Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
<s> Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
<s> No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
<s> Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
<s> What?
<s> Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
<s> Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
<s> Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
<s> Ah --
<s> It did?
<s> Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
<s> Yeah. Me?
<s> Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
<s> Whozat?
<s> Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
<s> Yeah --
<s> Don't push!
<s> It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
<s> Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
<s> A heart --
<s> Yes.
<s> Ho -- ho --ho
<s> Oh - look out.
<s> But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's....
<s> Well, I --
<s> Well, I --
<s> This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
<s> Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.
<s> So who are you?
<s> Elektra would control it all.
<s> We cant.
<s> I could come for a second opinion?
<s> Who?
<s> The doctor who saved him couldnt get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, hes a dead man.
<s> Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
<s> And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
<s> I cant tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
<s> You knew him well?
<s> Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
<s> Thats every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  Thats why youre here, isnt it? You think I cant do it. You think Im going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
<s> Were alright.
<s> I think youre one of the bravest people Ive ever met.
<s> Someone wants to kill me, Id rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
<s> Not at that price. Time to surrender.
<s> He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
<s> It is my oil!  Mine and my familys!
<s> BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
<s> But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.
<s> Please.
<s> Is it?
<s> No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
<s> I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
<s> Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
<s> Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
<s> Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
<s> I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
<s> Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
<s> I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
<s> Jon -- what??
<s> I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
<s> You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
<s> If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
<s> Adrian -- you've lost it.
<s> And what if youre wrong?
<s> Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
<s> Antarctica??
<s> Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.
<s> It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
<s> The costumes.  Am I right?
<s> That's because --
<s> Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
<s> Adrian.  Its too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
<s> I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
<s> Ever see one of these before?
<s> Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
<s> Looks like a diner.
<s> We're not after car thieves here.
<s> My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
<s> Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
<s> You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
<s> You wanna check it out? Come here.
<s> Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the "Finger of God". Assassination and weapons.
<s> "Anarchy" 99"?
<s> He gets to be the hero.
<s> I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
<s> You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
<s> The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
<s> There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
<s> It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
<s> Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
<s> That one I'm real familiar with.
<s> Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list.
<s> You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
<s> You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
<s> A parachute. This does not argue well.
<s> It's like you said, every man for himself.
<s> This pizda? Never seen him before.
<s> He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
<s> It'll work faster if I have an account number.
<s> You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
<s> You wanna see my politics?
<s> Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
<s> Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
<s> The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
<s> ... until he found tungsten.
<s> I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
<s> I won't light the cigars - how about that?
<s> What if I like the pain?
<s> He's busy right now.
<s> Not interested.
<s> Suit yourself.
<s> What do you want?
<s> You're backstage at the encore of creation.
<s> In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
<s> I'll go.
<s> If she held on any longer she could have.
<s> A piece.  Only a piece.
<s> And I'll never understand terrorists.
<s> Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
<s> The way what is going to be?
<s> WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
<s> You have the wrong house.
<s> Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
<s> No!
<s> From your office, sir.
<s> Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
<s> Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
<s> Baack!
<s> Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
<s> MMmmm.
<s> Well... yes.
<s> Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
<s> Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
<s> A week.  Ten days at most.
<s> The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> My father was a sick man.
<s> Fron kon steen!
<s> Wockers with the knockers???
<s> Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
<s> Why?
<s> You've got it, master.
<s> You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.
<s> I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
<s> It wasn't me.
<s> careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
<s> That's what we're paid for.
<s> That sound good, boss.
<s> It's the only way.
<s> It's alive!
<s> MMMMMmmmmmmm.
<s> I'm not sure I...get your drift.
<s> That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
<s> Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
<s> Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
<s> I think you've done it, master.
<s> I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
<s> I know Frederick.
<s> Of course not.
<s> It wouldn't be fair to her.
<s> Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.
<s> Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
<s> Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
<s> Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
<s> Oh, no sir-ee.  If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo.
<s> Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?
<s> I listened extra careful to your "Stand To" this mornin', Boy. ft was peifecL I couldn't 've done it better meseif, not even when I was Bugler to The Duke Of Wellington.. .now tell me, where did you get that black eye?
<s> Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
<s> And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40
<s> Thank you.
<s> Certainly, Sin
