<s> Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
<s> I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
<s> Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
<s> I believe we share an art instructor
<s> Hopefully.
<s> Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
<s> At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
<s> You're welcome.
<s> Like you care.
<s> Why?
<s> After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
<s> You set me up.
<s> What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
<s> It's just a party. Daddy.
<s> Why?
<s> He seems like he thrives on danger
<s> Okay!  I wasn't sure
<s> It's her favorite band.
<s> Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
<s> Don't make me do it, man
<s> Not at all
<s> Away.
<s> What do you think?
<s> Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
<s> But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
<s> Fine, thirty.
<s> Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
<s> Patrick Verona   Random skid.
<s> Block E?
<s> But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
<s> William would never have gone to a state school.
<s> My mission in life.
<s> And why would I do that?
<s> Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
<s> 
<s> I just need to lie down for awhile
<s> Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
<s> What?
<s> Then why'd you ask?
<s> BIANCA
<s> Look up, sunshine
<s> Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
<s> Maybe.
<s> So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
<s> Why not?
<s> I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
<s> Is that right?
<s> Because I like to torture you.
<s> I thought you were punishing me.
<s> No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
<s> What?
<s> Good enough.
<s> What's to discuss?
<s> See you next week!
<s> The water's going putrid in the barrels.
<s> Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
<s> Is that all that interests you? Gold?
<s> The Judgment is ours!
<s> On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
<s> Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
<s> I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
<s> Thank God...
<s> I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
<s> I am afraid this is not the worst news.
<s> He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
<s> I'm not bargaining!
<s> Look out of that window.
<s> To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
<s> I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
<s> I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
<s> Colon!  Don't!
<s> You are bound by an oath, Father.
<s> Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
<s> You will regret this.
<s> Come over here.
<s> Immediately.
<s> Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
<s> I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
<s> Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
<s> Somewhere else?
<s> So you were never a prostitute?
<s> I'm just trying to find out who you are.
<s> They're not gonna send you right back.
<s> Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
<s> No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
<s> Daphne, I...
<s> If I tell you, will you arrest me?
<s> Vodka tonic.
<s> Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
<s> What are you saying?
<s> Describe him.
<s> Good.  Good.  Commendable.
<s> Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
<s> You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
<s> Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
<s> This isn't homicide school.
<s> I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
<s> My point exactly.
<s> You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
<s> Just a shower?
<s> You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
<s> What's your accomplishment.
<s> Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
<s> You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
<s> Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
<s> Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
<s> You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
<s> I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
<s> No.  Are you proposing?
<s> Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
<s> Okay.
<s> I want to document my trip to America.
<s> And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
<s> The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
<s> Credit?
<s> A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
<s> This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
<s> Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
<s> Evidence.  Of a homicide.
<s> He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
<s> Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
<s> Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
<s> Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
<s> Yes?
<s> Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
<s> Yes.
<s> I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
<s> Sure, Dave, what's up?
<s> Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
<s> Yes, it is, Hal.
<s> Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
<s> Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
<s> In three days, darling, I hope.
<s> Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
<s> Fine.
<s> I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
<s> Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
<s> Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
<s> I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
<s> Any clue as to what it is?
<s> Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
<s> It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
<s> Yeah, I've been busy.
<s> It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
<s> Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
<s> Goodbye.
<s> No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
<s> Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
<s> I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
<s> What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
<s> Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
<s> Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
<s> Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
<s> Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
<s> But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
<s> I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
<s> Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
<s> You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
<s> You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
<s> I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
<s> Musta got some primo bondsman.
<s> I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
<s> Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
<s> I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
<s> You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
<s> Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
<s> Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
<s> You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
<s> No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
<s> Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
<s> They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
<s> They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
<s> I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
<s> What's wrong with that?
<s> I guess he got the message...
<s> Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
<s> Yeah, one of my favorites.
<s> Jack, are you okay?
<s> Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
<s> Hi, it's me...
<s> Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
<s> What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
<s> Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
<s> Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
<s> What do you want?
<s> I don't know what you're talkin' about.
<s> No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
<s> What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
<s> Not bad, not bad.
<s> Napoleon... small.
<s> I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
<s> I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
<s> ...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
<s> I know...
<s> It means, "Never without my permission".
<s> Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
<s> That's what I'm saying.
<s> On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
<s> Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
<s> I was talking to the cat.
<s> You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
<s> Don't exist bud.
<s> How do I look?
<s> Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
<s> I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
<s> ...Leeloo.
<s> I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
<s> I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
<s> Crystal.
<s> I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
<s> And the third one?
<s> Three of us will never fit in there!
<s> Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
<s> Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
<s> Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
<s> You gotta push the little yellow button...
<s> Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
<s> Got it.
<s> ...I can't wait to be among you.
<s> What's wrong?  Are you alright?
<s> Don't...
<s> What you see is what I got, mister.
<s> There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
<s> Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
<s> And they are?
<s> Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
<s> What are you... ?
<s> Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
<s> How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
<s> You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
<s> One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
<s> It was a lot of fucking money.
<s> Something like that.
<s> You enjoy it?
<s> Tell me what happened.
<s> Of what sort?
<s> Shut up.
<s> Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
<s> Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
<s> Three, four years.
<s> There's not much illegal.
<s> Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
<s> I don't know, where are yours?
<s> I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
<s> Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
<s> You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
<s> See ya.
<s> He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
<s> My condolences.
<s> We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
<s> I'm afraid I don't...
<s> Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.
<s> No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
<s> You've found missing persons before.
<s> Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
<s> Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
<s> Neil... Neil Cole.
<s> It got to be too much for him.
<s> Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
<s> I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
<s> Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
<s> None too discreet, is he?
<s> I don't want to.
<s> Kristen...
<s> How'd you learn so much about dreams?
<s> You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
<s> You're his sister, right?
<s> Three days.
<s> Save it for later.  Come on!
<s> Alright, I think I see salvation...
<s> It was Freddy.
<s> Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
<s> I though Freddy was just an old town story.
<s> It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
<s> Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
<s> Don't worry, honey
<s> How did you know that?
<s> Jesus!  Don't do that!
<s> Sobering...
<s> Had kind of a long night.
<s> Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
<s> If they actually bothered to bury her.
<s> I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
<s> Mark!
<s> It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
<s> I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
<s> That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
<s> But I've seen her grave.
<s> You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
<s> All of us.  Right?
<s> He invited me to his house last night.
<s> Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
<s> We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
<s> You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
<s> You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
<s> - any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
<s> Yes?
<s> But if they <u>do</u>?
<s> Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
<s> Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
<s> You know - it <u>is</u>?
<s> Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
<s> Somewhere down there?
<s> We'll have to look for them later.
<s> What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
<s> Right at our one-eyed friend!
<s> The frogmen?
<s> Yes, Griff?
<s> Something wrong?
<s> What about time...?
<s> <u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
<s> I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
<s> Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
<s> But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
<s> Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
<s> What is the Northcountry Development Association?
<s> Twombley involved?
<s> He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
<s> Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Oh.
<s> Really.
<s> LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
<s> What blood?
<s> Lawford?
<s> Do what?
<s> It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
<s> I don't want to.
<s> No.
<s> I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
<s> I called Mommy.
<s> I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
<s> Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
<s> Nothing.
<s> I want to go home.
<s> Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
<s> Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
<s> You want me to follow them to Littleton?
<s> I'm fine, fine.
<s> Where's Jill?
<s> Yeah, lots.
<s> You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
<s> Said what?
<s> Yeah. I mean that.
<s> The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
<s> I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
<s> Jack doesn't need money.
<s> I've been thinking about it, that's all.
<s> When did she die?
<s> Can --?
<s> I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
<s> Jack?
<s> Atta-go.
<s> Sleeping.
<s> I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
<s> Bang!
<s> Crawl!
<s> Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
<s> Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
<s> I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
<s> Well, I never heard that one.
<s> For what?
<s> I'm sure he's busy.
<s> Alice...
<s> I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
<s> Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
<s> You are a resilient man, Mr.
<s> Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
<s> He's busy being dead.
<s> Lemme take a look.
<s> Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
<s> To swear you in as President.
<s> Dead.
<s> Nine.
<s> Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
<s> Tower, here.
<s> Copy, Air Force One.
<s> Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
<s> Good. Good.
<s> One thing I've learned as
<s> Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
<s> Gravity.
<s> Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
<s> Both of you.
<s> I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
<s> That just doesn't make any sense.
<s> Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
<s> Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
<s> If that's the way you want it.
<s> I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
<s> Not now, Elaine.
<s> Not when I'm with you, Ted.
<s> Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
<s> Simon, why has he become so... so...
<s> You can do it from up here, Captain.
<s> Negative.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
<s> Sure.
<s> We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
<s> I don't want to hear that word!
<s> All right.  Here.
<s> What?
<s> All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
<s> Sixteen 'C', why?
<s> Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
<s> Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
<s> Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
<s> Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
<s> Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
<s> I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
<s> I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
<s> Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
<s> Can you fly this airplane and land it?
<s> Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
<s> Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
<s> Surely there must be something you can do.
<s> Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
<s> Well...
<s> My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
<s> I love you, Elaine.
<s> I remember everything. All I have are memories.
<s> Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
<s> That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
<s> It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
<s> I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
<s> Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
<s> Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
<s> ...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
<s> Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
<s> No, why don't you take care ot it?
<s> Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
<s> Yeah...
<s> Yes...
<s> You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
<s> It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
<s> A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
<s> So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
<s> Did you talk to him?
<s> Stay back!  I'm okay.
<s> In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
<s> This is mole.  It's good.
<s> Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
<s> You must leave me alone on this.
<s> No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
<s> ... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
<s> There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
<s> ... It's Harcourt.
<s> No... two.
<s> We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
<s> Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
<s> Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
<s> Ss'kya'ta'.
<s> That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
<s> Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
<s> Yeah, I'll bet.
<s> Departmental policy.
<s> Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
<s> Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
<s> Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
<s> I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
<s> What?
<s> She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
<s> Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
<s> What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
<s> But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
<s> You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
<s> PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
<s> Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
<s> The structure seems intact.  They have power.
<s> I don't know.
<s> So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
<s> Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
<s> You tell me.  I only work here.
<s> Sure, Hicks.
<s> Are you finished?  You okay?
<s> About seventeen days.
<s> We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
<s> No.  Have you?
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Uh, what's next?
<s> They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
<s> Can't be.  That's inside the room!
<s> Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
<s> Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
<s> Terrible.
<s> I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
<s> Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
<s> Right here, baby.  Right here.
<s> That's right.
<s> I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
<s> Extremely clever.
<s> Don't bother!
<s> But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
<s> Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
<s> I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
<s> We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
<s> Why? People fart backwards.
<s> Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
<s> No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
<s> Ui-vol-i-tub!
<s> They'll come anyway. They love me here.
<s> You borrowed money from your mother?
<s> Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
<s> I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
<s> Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
<s> It's killing me.
<s> Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
<s> My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
<s> Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
<s> What for?
<s> No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
<s> Oh, yes.
<s> Michael!
<s> You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
<s> It's just a trifle, of course.
<s> You do me too much honour, Sire.
<s> Ah-ha!
<s> Your Highness.
<s> Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
<s> It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
<s> It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
<s> Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
<s> Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
<s> Ah! By all means.
<s> Well, yes, I admit it is.
<s> It's a secret.
<s> It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
<s> Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
<s> Yes what?
<s> I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
<s> They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
<s> German!
<s> Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
<s> Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
<s> Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
<s> It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
<s> Of course not.
<s> Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
<s> Thank you! Oh, thank you.
<s> I'm taking you home. You're not well.
<s> I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
<s> I'm too young to be so sick.
<s> Come. Let's begin.
<s> I think so.
<s> You go fast!
<s> Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
<s> But, Your Majesty -
<s> What is what?
<s> Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
<s> My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
<s> God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
<s> The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
<s> Yes?
<s> I've seen the manuscript.
<s> Never mind.
<s> Well done, Sire!
<s> Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
<s> Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
<s> Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
<s> The American? Yes, duck.
<s> Yes, Doctor.
<s> Yes, Doctor?
<s> Warn him?
<s> They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
<s> I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
<s> The zoo? Is he rational?
<s> Is David acting strangely?
<s> Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
<s> I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
<s> Not just a patient -- me.
<s> A werewolf?
<s> It's nice to see you.
<s> Werewolves simply do not exist.
<s> Jack is dead!
<s> Will you shut up!?!!
<s> David, don't lose control.
<s> No.
<s> Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
<s> Chart says he's from New York.
<s> Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
<s> Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
<s> This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
<s> Where am I?
<s> David.
<s> I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
<s> A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
<s> I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
<s> Come on, I'm freezing.
<s> Yeah?
<s> It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
<s> I don't know. Come on.
<s> A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
<s> No.
<s> I'll tell you when we get there.
<s> Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
<s> Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
<s> Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
<s> No.
<s> And what, Sergeant?
<s> I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
<s> The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
<s> Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
<s> What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
<s> You understand?
<s> Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
<s> They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
<s> All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
<s> My apartment.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Oh, yeah?
<s> Got a handkerchief?
<s> Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
<s> Of course, let them in! You're late now.
<s> Hello, darling.
<s> Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
<s> You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn
<s> Well . . .
<s> In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
<s> Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
<s> Where is he now?
<s> Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
<s> Why, I don't know.
<s> There you are.
<s> Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
<s> Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
<s> All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
<s> Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
<s> Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that
<s> Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
<s> Mr. Williams . . .
<s> Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.
<s> What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
<s> Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after
<s> Yes.
<s> I guess so.
<s> Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
<s> You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
<s> I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
<s> Exactly.
<s> Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
<s> I could use the walk.
<s> There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
<s> Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
<s> What is wrong with you?
<s> She was European!
<s> Yeah.
<s> If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
<s> I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
<s> You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!
<s> We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
<s> I'm thinking...
<s> Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
<s> Sadie was not a man!
<s> Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
<s> All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
<s> Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
<s> It's a secret.
<s> Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
<s> I figure.
<s> Don't care.
<s> Fine. How'd it go out here?
<s> And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
<s> If I could go back to farming --
<s> I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
<s> A fair number, Ma.
<s> What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
<s> Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
<s> You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
<s> Sparkling rocks?
<s> Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
<s> Fair enough.
<s> I hope I'm not being too forward.
<s> NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
<s> How much did they get from the safe?
<s> Sir?
<s> What, sir?
<s> I remember you.
<s> Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
<s> What? Oh, I'm...busy.
<s> Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
<s> Is that Donald Trump's car?
<s> Is it a what?
<s> I'm ignoring you.
<s> Turn the light on.
<s> Take it off.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
<s> You and...Luis?
<s> Yes, Courtney?
<s> Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
<s> Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
<s> Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
<s> I know her. I knew her.
<s> Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
<s> No, he doesn't.
<s> Yes, naturally.
<s> Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
<s> No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
<s> It's just not.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> It looks that way, doesn't it?
<s> Maybe it's just the light.
<s> What?
<s> Like what?
<s> Ask me a question.
<s> Two at nine? Perfect.
<s> Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
<s> No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
<s> Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
<s> I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.
<s> Can you bring Mr...
<s> I'm on a diet. But thank you.
<s> You can always he thinner. Look...better.
<s> No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
<s> No, not really.
<s> Jean? Hello? Jean?
<s> I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
<s> Next Saturday?
<s> Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matine of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
<s> Uh huh?
<s> No.
<s> Patrick, you re a lunatic.
<s> Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
<s> Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
<s> Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
<s> No. I'm okay.
<s> The disappearance of Paul Owen.
<s> Hang...out?
<s> No, he just hung out there.
<s> Oh.
<s> What?
<s> Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
<s> Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
<s> Not in the mood, I guess.
<s> Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
<s> I'm not...
<s> I'm hungry
<s> Al.
<s> Oh well, you know.
<s> We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
<s> They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
<s> "Make" him?
<s> Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
<s> I know, I know.
<s> Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
<s> Milo. Why would he --
<s> Look at me! I'm gonna change.
<s> He'll tell me when he gets home.
<s> Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
<s> There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
<s> Gary, don't worry, we --
<s> Wait... He knows.
<s> Got out of my other commitment.
<s> Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
<s> No. Please.
<s> You're compulsive.
<s> Why's that?
<s> The Day Care?
<s> They'd frame him.
<s> There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
<s> Certainly not at my happy home.
<s> Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!
<s> What?
<s> I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
<s> 'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
<s> Gary.
<s> The dishes are juiced up, too.
<s> Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
<s> Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
<s> What?
<s> What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
<s> Sak-i it to me!
<s> Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
<s> You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
<s> A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
<s> We won, Austin.
<s> No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.
<s> Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
<s> There's one more thing, Austin.
<s> That's not your mother, that's a man!
<s> Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
<s> I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
<s> I'm sorry?
<s> Here, use mine.
<s> It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
<s> Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
<s> Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
<s> I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
<s> I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
<s> Hey, wait a minute--
<s> No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
<s> What are you saying, son?
<s> Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
<s> Silence!
<s> They're mutated sea bass.
<s> I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
<s> Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
<s> You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
<s> Well, it's kind of weird.
<s> OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
<s> I don't wanna take over the family business.
<s> There are limits?
<s> No need. I'll call again.
<s> ... bottle ...
<s> ... head ...
<s> Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
<s> If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
<s> Rules are made to be broken.
<s> Ropes?
<s> To find out who killed my husband.
<s> Ring?
<s> Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
<s> Mother?
<s> We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
<s> Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
<s> A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
<s> The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
<s> How on earth can you tell?
<s> She had this in her mouth. There, there...
<s> Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
<s> Mrs. Peel ... ?
<s> Nothing personal.
<s> After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
<s> You lied.
<s> It's called Black Leather.
<s> Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
<s> Not quite.
<s> Pity your mother came, too ...
<s> I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
<s> You're saying I have no choice.
<s> I know all this.
<s> Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
<s> I feel sure of it.
<s> Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
<s> Walk over to the window ...
<s> That's not playing by the rules.
<s> Hey, man, congratulations!
<s> Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
<s> When do the girls get to the party?
<s> Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
<s> Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
<s> Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
<s> Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
<s> I've tried to change her mind.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
<s> You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
<s> I'm going now, Cole.
<s> But a fabulous cook.
<s> Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
<s> About what?
<s> I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
<s> C'mere.
<s> Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
<s> Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
<s> I am committed. I love you.
<s> You're so romantic...
<s> You know your father enjoys his company.
<s> I hope those guys are all right.
<s> All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
<s> I'm going to see what the hell happened.
<s> I want women.
<s> All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."
<s> It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
<s> I'm separated.
<s> If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
<s> Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
<s> It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
<s> Let me take the lead, Stephen...
<s> There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
<s> I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
<s> Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
<s> Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
<s> ...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
<s> I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
<s> Yeah? What have you been up to?
<s> Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
<s> Well, you did invite me here.
<s> -- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
<s> -- I work for the city.
<s> I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
<s> You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
<s> What?
<s> What reason?
<s> I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
<s> How ya feeling?
<s> Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
<s> Engine 115, right?
<s> It's in my blood, Willy.
<s> Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
<s> You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?
<s> -- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
<s> I'll be there, goddamn it!
<s> Fixing my roof.
<s> The great communicator.
<s> He's out.
<s> Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
<s> Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
<s> And old ladies?
<s> Investigator Rimgale.
<s> "Don?"
<s> Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
<s> OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
<s> What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
<s> What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
<s> You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
<s> Did he gots to be.
<s> I didn't mean to scare you like that.
<s> Give me some?
<s> Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
<s> Please.
<s> Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
<s> You ain't happy about the green light?
<s> Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
<s> Manray needs a job.
<s> My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
<s> Did we get our bill yet?
<s> I'm tired of waiting.
<s> EUREKA!!
<s> No costume.  No blackface.
<s> I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
<s> I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
<s> ...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
<s> I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
<s> And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
<s> I don't know about that plantation angle.
<s> We think so.
<s> I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
<s> I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
<s> How did you end up here?
<s> Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
<s> I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
<s> It hit me like a ton of bricks.
<s> You getting cold feet?
<s> I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
<s> Break a leg.
<s> No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
<s> You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
<s> That's why it will be so much fun.
<s> I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
<s> Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
<s> What you did is dead wrong.
<s> My name is Manray, goddamnit.
<s> C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
<s> Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
<s> I can't go all the way down south.
<s> Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
<s> This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
<s> A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
<s> I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
<s> Tavis, thank you for having me.
<s> Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
<s> I thought you got rid of...
<s> ...like grits and butter...
<s> Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
<s> Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
<s> Never read a book in my whole life.
<s> Just ask me what you want to know.
<s> Say what, Manray?
<s> Good morning.
<s> That is none of your business.
<s> I never was more in earnest.
<s> What is your uncle's name?
<s> This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
<s> It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
<s> Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
<s> It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
<s> Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
<s> I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
<s> I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
<s> Certain?
<s> But, for a time... a passing fancy?
<s> Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
<s> It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
<s> With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
<s> Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
<s> The Prince left him only that choice.
<s> What is to be done?
<s> Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him "good luck."
<s> Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
<s> You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
<s> Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
<s> Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
<s> Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
<s> Tender Hegenheim.
<s> You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
<s> Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
<s> We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
<s> I just don't like it.
<s> Okay.
<s> Tell me about them.
<s> Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
<s> This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
<s> Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
<s> Can't do that now, though, can you?
<s> Sir, yes, sir!
<s> Why?
<s> Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there --  Where's West?
<s> You're the only one missing a grenade.
<s> Just look. Little pocket.
<s> You're lying --
<s> That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
<s> I didn't do anything --
<s> I didn't --
<s> Maybe --
<s> And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
<s> Well, he's a good soldier.
<s> Who killed Pike?
<s> Or what? You've gone round the bend --
<s> That's preposterous --
<s> Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
<s> Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
<s> Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
<s> Good cop/bad cop?
<s> Best time for banal chit-chat.
<s> You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
<s> Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
<s> I don't know.
<s> Watch me.
<s> And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
<s> Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
<s> Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
<s> You wanted to get the truth.
<s> Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
<s> Seven.
<s> Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
<s> You can't threaten me --
<s> What?
<s> I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
<s> Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
<s> -- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
<s> It's too neat.
<s> Sir, yes, sir!
<s> Yes.
<s> He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
<s> It truly is.
<s> I'll go in right now and get that eye.
<s> Fine, I'm doing it.
<s> Don.
<s> My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
<s> Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
<s> You're pretty good at arithmetic.
<s> I'm not convinced you should be happy.
<s> I see. I thank you for your time.
<s> Stop.
<s> Can I take your picture?
<s> Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
<s> Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
<s> Am I?
<s> Did you do any of that?
<s> No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
<s> So how does it happen?
<s> It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
<s> Oh, so you know.
<s> Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
<s> I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
<s> It would kill you, huh?
<s> Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
<s> I have the rest of my life to find out.
<s> You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
<s> I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
<s> 'Fraid so.
<s> My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
<s> I do.
<s> It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
<s> But it's not true.
<s> Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
<s> He's up with your father.
<s> You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
<s> Yes. But that's a different...
<s> Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
<s> No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
<s> Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
<s> It is. I did it cooking.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No I haven't.
<s> I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
<s> Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> What? What does he want?
<s> I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes I know.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> You don't understand anything.
<s> You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
<s> No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
<s> Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
<s> But, you know, so what?
<s> Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
<s> So now you hate all women?
<s> You didn't mind too much.
<s> You don't understand you either.
<s> Get out.
<s> Laugh it up.
<s> Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
<s> You hurt it?
<s> This gonna get you in trouble?
<s> I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
<s> Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.
<s> No, ma'am.
<s> Can I put it in your mouth?
<s> You been home yet?
<s> I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
<s> You don't got half what Tehronne got.
<s> LAZ, I said let...!
<s> Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
<s> Come on, gal...
<s> Well I don't...
<s> Don't need none.
<s> The fuck you been doin' to me?
<s> You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
<s> I CAN'T!
<s> Uh-uh.
<s> Uh-uh.
<s> Sure.
<s> We drinkin' buddies now?
<s> The... chain helps.
<s> I tried.
<s> No, you do it. I can't sing.
<s> What I love.
<s> Maybe I won't.
<s> Word wit'cha. In private.
<s> This Rae... you get with her?
<s> Now, hold up.
<s> Like I told you.
<s> This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
<s> THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT?
<s> Please don't tell my daddy.
<s> Rae!
<s> Yeah, I do.
<s> You need money again?
<s> You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
<s> Thought you had a man for that.
<s> So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
<s> Charlie...
<s> What?
<s> No.
<s> Number five with a bullet.
<s> Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
<s> They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
<s> There she is!
<s> Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
<s> Good.  Very good...
<s> You were too far behind.
<s> Shut-up.
<s> He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
<s> There was a change in plans.
<s> I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
<s> You have a helluva way of asking for help.
<s> Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
<s> I need someone to translate for me.
<s> You could fake it.
<s> Who am I supposed to be?
<s> You're foreigners.
<s> Do you know what this is?
<s> Look.
<s> Not to be trapped.
<s> Oh?
<s> Had in mind something a little more radical.
<s> Also extraordinary things.
<s> Tomorrow, he says.
<s> What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
<s> Soon as I finish the job.
<s> The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
<s> I like you too.
<s> I'm taking a piss.
<s> These aren't just...
<s> Huh huh.
<s> Yes?
<s> Do you recognize any of them?
<s> What did she want?
<s> Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
<s> I don't know nothing about it.
<s> Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
<s> I work alone.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Can you?  I couldn't.
<s> There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
<s> It wasn't very good last night, was it?
<s> What?
<s> Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
<s> What difference will it make?
<s> What's up?
<s> Yes.
<s> Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
<s> Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.
<s> A tortoise.  What's that?
<s> I never seen a turtle.
<s> They left.
<s> You scared me.
<s> As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
<s> You're all so perfect.
<s> I'm Adam Webber.
<s> Come where?
<s> For how long?
<s> I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
<s> Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
<s> I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
<s> No.
<s> The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
<s> It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
<s> Sorry.
<s> I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
<s> Two weeks.
<s> He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
<s> Sure.
<s> That's boring!
<s> It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
<s> Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
<s> Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
<s> Do I look crazy?
<s> Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
<s> Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
<s> Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
<s> No. Sit down.
<s> Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
<s> Yes, sir.  Is that all?
<s> Adult Bookstore.  Why?
<s> Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
<s> Yes. That's kind of how it was.
<s> Uh, I think they have.
<s> You nut!
<s> Juneau.
<s> Yeah.
<s> The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
<s> Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
<s> I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
<s> Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
<s> Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
<s> The sky!!!
<s> Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
<s> Hi.
<s> Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
<s> I'll go up.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
<s> I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
<s> To go up.
<s> No.
<s> I'm not hungry.
<s> How could you?! This is just like home!
<s> If I...you know...
<s> Right here!
<s> What?
<s> Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
<s> Coming!
<s> And I made these!
<s> --and we will--
<s> Some time.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> Your stuff?  Let me see that.
<s> I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
<s> Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
<s> I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
<s> Eve?!
<s> Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
<s> We did not leave together.
<s> I know...I know. You did the right thing.
<s> We'll find him.
<s> I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
<s> Have him committed.
<s> He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
<s> None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
<s> No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
<s> Okay honey.
<s> Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
<s> It must be great.
<s> Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
<s> It's blue. Blue velvet.
<s> Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
<s> Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
<s> I wanted to see you.
<s> I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
<s> You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
<s> Then you got undressed.
<s> No.
<s> What?
<s> I, uh.
<s> Same here.
<s> Frank? Can you stand up?
<s> I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
<s> I sure don't hate you.
<s> Beeeee careful.
<s> What if Frank came over here and found us?
<s> Kiss me.
<s> Just get outta my bed.
<s> It's okay. It's okay.
<s> My bourbon.
<s> Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
<s> Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  Hey, pretty, pretty.
<s> Go where?
<s> I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
<s> Jeffrey, when you see your father.
<s> He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
<s> Do you want the car?
<s> Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
<s> Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
<s> I'll get a coat for her.
<s> Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
<s> Terrible boring.
<s> Yeah. What are you doing now?
<s> There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
<s> Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
<s> I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
<s> Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
<s> Two.
<s> It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
<s> Okay, okay. Bye.
<s> OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
<s> Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
<s> That's what I thought.
<s> I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
<s> Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
<s> Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
<s> Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
<s> I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
<s> You look beautiful.
<s> Frank!!!
<s> Got it.
<s> You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
<s> Yes.
<s> Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
<s> Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
<s> Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
<s> Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
<s> This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
<s> Connor, is that you?
<s> We... met them last night.
<s> Our mother can see through bags.
<s> Right.
<s> Fuck!
<s> Ass!
<s> No pictures, either.
<s> I'm strangely comfortable with it.
<s> Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
<s> Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
<s> Can she I.D. them?
<s> Of course they were. How many?
<s> That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
<s> Really want to know?
<s> Hey Murph.
<s> Y'know it is, a bit.
<s> You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
<s> It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
<s> The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
<s> Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
<s> Would they do that?
<s> Yeah, I saw it.
<s> Just turn right here.
<s> No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
<s> You're right. You're right.
<s> We got it. We got it.
<s> Like he meant it.
<s> He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
<s> Because my mom gets the bill.
<s> They obviously weren't designed for racing.
<s> Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
<s> It's not a plan. It's just --
<s> No kidding.
<s> No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
<s> This was in fourth grade.
<s> Where was it parked?
<s> Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
<s> That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
<s> Roger.
<s> Nobody move!
<s> It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
<s> I'll see you there.
<s> What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
<s> You're kidding.
<s> Dignan, I --
<s> So do I.
<s> Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
<s> Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
<s> Yeah. He said that.
<s> I hope not.
<s> I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
<s> OK, Dad.
<s> And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
<s> No, I don't mind.
<s> Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
<s> Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
<s> Sure.
<s> No.
<s> You're Anthony?
<s> I hear you're a good thief.
<s> Abdul-Shabazz?
<s> Wait a second.
<s> True.
<s> Not even for emergencies?
<s> So who's going to know?
<s> You're the one who kept saying ram him.
<s> Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
<s> I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Well, obviously, we got to go back.
<s> Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
<s> I'm going back.
<s> Yeah. It is.
<s> I never agreed to that.
<s> I know it, man. Hang on.
<s> Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
<s> I didn't think there was an alarm.
<s> We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
<s> 26 weeks.
<s> Social issues. Crime prevention.
<s> Well, I left some money in there.
<s> No, my friend knows her.
<s> Got a little lucky.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> -- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
<s> I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
<s> I should be better by now.
<s> No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 
<s> Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
<s> But you found another choice.
<s> They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
<s> Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
<s> No. You never worked Berlin.
<s> I want to come in.
<s> Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
<s> Sounds like a threat.
<s> -- the hotel -- how far? --
<s> Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
<s> Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
<s> What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
<s> We must sue for peace.
<s> He has already agreed to come.
<s> He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
<s> I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
<s> You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
<s> Scotland. He intends --
<s> Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
<s> Fourteen? --
<s> No. One of us is enough.
<s> With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
<s> The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
<s> We don't split up!
<s> In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
<s> Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
<s> Thank you for inviting.
<s> He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
<s> A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
<s> She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
<s> Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
<s> Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
<s> Aye. But it won't let me dream.
<s> Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
<s> It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days.
<s> Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
<s> Um... can dad come this time?
<s> Can't he come out for one day?
<s> I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
<s> I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
<s> Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
<s> How long will I be in here?
<s> Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
<s> Photos?
<s> Damn. Your dad did this?
<s> I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
<s> I've stopped a hundred times.
<s> Of course.
<s> Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
<s> Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
<s> What?
<s> I get it. You can drop it now.
<s> Which is?
<s> We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
<s> When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
<s> It's crossed my mind from time to time.
<s> Who's to say you can't make things better?
<s> Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
<s> I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
<s> I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
<s> Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
<s> Deal. Now read me something.
<s> Y... yes. I guess I did.
<s> Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
<s> Huh?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> You're such a retard!
<s> And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
<s> Thank you, but I hardly think --
<s> No thanks, Carl.
<s> Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
<s> Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
<s> It's not for sale.
<s> It's not for sale at any price.
<s> I'll tell him when he comes in.
<s> I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
<s> Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
<s> All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
<s> I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
<s> Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
<s> -- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
<s> I don't have to. I've got them right here.
<s> All except one. He won't have you.
<s> I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
<s> -- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
<s> No.
<s> And I said I would never leave you.
<s> Be careful.
<s> But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
<s> -- Yes?
<s> He came from Paris with Rick.
<s> Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I...  were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
<s> Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
<s> What for?
<s> Good evening. You see, here we are again.
<s> Yes, I get the point.
<s> Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
<s> Keep it. You'll need it in America.
<s> Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
<s> Yes.
<s> No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
<s> Thank you.
<s> You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
<s> Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
<s> Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
<s> Champagne and a tin of caviar.
<s> If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
<s> Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
<s> Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
<s> Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
<s> Oh, he won't be followed here.
<s> That's so long ago, I don't remember.
<s> Sacha, she's had enough.
<s> -- Sacha, call a cab.
<s> Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
<s> Well, what makes you think I haven't?
<s> If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
<s> I like it fine here.
<s> Uh, my watch stopped.
<s> Do too much, I'll die.
<s> Going to die anyway.
<s> Fix raft first.
<s> Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
<s> Well, not really, I --
<s> Had a package to deliver.
<s> I've got lots of time.
<s> You smell like formaldehyde.
<s> I thought I did.
<s> Not if you work for FedEx.
<s> For when I travel?
<s> A few things came up.  Or went down.
<s> My epitaph.
<s> Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
<s> And how was your Christmas?
<s> Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
<s> Let's eat.
<s> Mom, meet Jango.
<s> It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
<s> Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
<s> What's going on down there?
<s> Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
<s> The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
<s> Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
<s> You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
<s> That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
<s> Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.
<s> Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
<s> It's me.
<s> You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!
<s> You should have smelled me.
<s> Hallelujah.
<s> What's it all about?  It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
<s> I need to do it.
<s> No sweat.
<s> San Francisco.  And you?
<s> Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
<s> He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
<s> "An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
<s> It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
<s> I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
<s> Better than I can!
<s> Burma!
<s> Okay...
<s> We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
<s> *Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
<s> He's *paralyzed*!
<s> No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
<s> I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
<s> *Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
<s> She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
<s> No. She was an immigrant.
<s> Actually, I volunteered.
<s> Oh, I would love that, Wally.
<s> Migrants?
<s> Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.
<s> Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
<s> No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
<s> Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!
<s> Obviously.
<s> You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
<s> I can't read. Nobody taught me.
<s> Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
<s> *No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
<s> Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
<s> Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
<s> Why was he missing for twenty days?
<s> It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk.
<s> Mind your own business, Peaches.
<s> It look nicer then home!
<s> Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
<s> *You* taught her, I suppose...
<s> That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
<s> You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
<s> Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
<s> What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
<s> No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
<s> Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
<s> We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
<s> Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
<s> You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
<s> Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.
<s> Guess so.
<s> Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
<s> And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?
<s> Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?
<s> People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
<s> I told you, use less powder.
<s> That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
<s> I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
<s> I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
<s> No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
<s> I have a good crew.
<s> I can't do that.
<s> Because you killed one of my crew.
<s> I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
<s> I think two million.
<s> No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake.  And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape.
<s> I think I just broke my hand.
<s> Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
<s> Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
<s> Sure.
<s> We're not cops.
<s> Lighten up.
<s> What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
<s> You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
<s> I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
<s> If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
<s> Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
<s> Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
<s> Good point.
<s> We never had a problem with that before.
<s> You going to have the time?
<s> Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
<s> Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.
<s> What?
<s> Eee Oott Auught!
<s> A little bit of both.
<s> You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
<s> He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
<s> Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
<s> Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
<s> To who?
<s> High five.
<s> What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
<s> I'll try and make it.
<s> I hope it brings you luck.
<s> You were talking in your sleep.
<s> Found a job?
<s> There's a casino in this hotel.
<s> I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
<s> We all came from Africa, supposedly.
<s> Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.
<s> Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
<s> What kind of trouble?
<s> I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
<s> Who's they?
<s> I can't do it, Jani.
<s> Wait a minute...
<s> I told you, all bets are off.
<s> Do you?
<s> You've done pretty well.
<s> No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
<s> Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
<s> No thanks.
<s> Give me 365.
<s> I don't gamble.
<s> Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
<s> Yes.
<s> Fine.
<s> Fine.
<s> Bruised.
<s> What flickering light?
<s> Look, bomb...
<s> Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
<s> Well, it is kind of a long shot...
<s> He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
<s> In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.
<s> What?
<s> Who cares. Don't bother me.
<s> Ah, negative drop.
<s> -- remove thrust drive repellant --
<s> -- Remark.
<s> I like it up here.
<s> I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
<s> I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
<s> ...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
<s> Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
<s> Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
<s> What was that, Doolittle?
<s> It didn't work?
<s> Phenomenology...
<s> Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
<s> That's not why we're here.
<s> What're you talkin' about?
<s> Where?
<s> Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
<s> Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
<s> I ain't mad at you...
<s> It's a rule.
<s> Am I?
<s> Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
<s> SHHH!  Don't do that!
<s> I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
<s> One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
<s> You need to get out more.
<s> You lost me.
<s> The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
<s> My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
<s> On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
<s> I don't know what to say.
<s> Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
<s> Any idea when she'll be back?
<s> With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
<s> My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
<s> He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
<s> Then what?
<s> Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
<s> They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
<s> You and me both.
<s> No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
<s> I just don't go in with any expectations.
<s> They're prisoners to their genes.
<s> You get it when I get her.
<s> I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
<s> What if he's on the level?
<s> Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
<s> You don't.
<s> Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
<s> You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
<s> None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
<s> Theo's dead.
<s> I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
<s> Gin.
<s> Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
<s> Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
<s> What's it worth to you?
<s> Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
<s> Check!
<s> Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
<s> ...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
<s> Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...
<s> Nah. Couldn't be.
<s> The easy way.
<s> Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
<s> Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
<s> Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
<s> You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
<s> Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
<s> Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
<s> Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.
<s> Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
<s> It's not nearly enough, punk.
<s> Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
<s> When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
<s> You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
<s> Sure.
<s> That's easy. Antiseptics.
<s> You mean soap?
<s> Will you go with me?
<s> No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
<s> Infant Memory Generators.
<s> Hey. You OK?
<s> There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
<s> Where are we going?
<s> If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
<s> I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
<s> Do they know yet?
<s> Where it came from?
<s> A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
<s> Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
<s> I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
<s> I met a girl.
<s> I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
<s> I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
<s> No. That makes you keep searching.
<s> Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
<s> I know.
<s> I... I was playing with fire.
<s> If God exists?
<s> Where are we going?
<s> Her name is Gretchen.
<s> You're not a bitch.
<s> I guess they made him do it.
<s> Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
<s> Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
<s> I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
<s> Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
<s> I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
<s> Your parents'd kill you.
<s> Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
<s> You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
<s> Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
<s> I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
<s> No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
<s> Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
<s> Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
<s> Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
<s> I just did.
<s> Yes, Leslie!
<s> Hi.
<s> Bye.
<s> "Most smartest?" Oh, that's good, Loretta. Make sure you get a picture of that. "Most smartest." We're cuttin you off and sendin' you home.
<s> I'll be right back. See ya later.
<s> So? Be real easy.
<s> She's the winner and we're going to state.
<s> Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
<s> Enid ate a whole pan!
<s> Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.
<s> No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
<s> I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
<s> He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
<s> Yankee Poodle.
<s> I don't want him.
<s> He only weighs ten ounces --
<s> You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
<s> Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
<s> Sure.
<s> All right -- I'll go out and find one.
<s> If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
<s> You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary? 
<s> Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
<s> You swine!
<s> You worm!
<s> No... it was a seven letter word.
<s> That's it...
<s> I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
<s> That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
<s> You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
<s> This is terrible!
<s> She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
<s> If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
<s> Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
<s> Hmmm?
<s> But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
<s> I intend to.
<s> Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
<s> He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
<s> You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
<s> It's quite nutritious, sir.
<s> Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
<s> Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
<s> I feel much better. Thank you.
<s> Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...
<s> I am very pleased to meet you.
<s> Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
<s> That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
<s> No, but I certainly shall.
<s> Oh no?
<s> Oh no, my friend...
<s> The main spire.
<s> You did not ask me.
<s> That's a canopy, John.
<s> Oh, our relatives... the children.
<s> Your mother?
<s> You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
<s> Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
<s> Yes, very soon.
<s> Then I shouldn't change anything?
<s> You too, my friend. Goodnight.
<s> No, he's very upset about something.
<s> We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
<s> But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
<s> Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
<s> Ah! It's my father!
<s> I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...
<s> Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
<s> Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
<s> Five this week; how many the week before?
<s> No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
<s> The second note to wake the Gods...
<s> What d'you mean?
<s> Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
<s> The Gods are asleep, Erik.
<s> Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
<s> Yes... oh, yes...
<s> The important thing is not to panic.
<s> Yes.
<s> What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
<s> Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
<s> Ah.
<s> I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
<s> Why... should YOU care?
<s> I know!
<s> That's my boy!
<s> Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
<s> Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
<s> Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
<s> Oh... er... yes...
<s> DEATH!
<s> Bye... sorry...
<s> The Dragon...
<s> Do what?
<s> No, I'm not.
<s> Hang on...
<s> You can't let Erik do THAT.
<s> By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
<s> So did your father...
<s> But it's a responsibility...
<s> Not now, Sven...
<s> Helpless...
<s> Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
<s> I hope you feel better, sweetie.
<s> Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
<s> You were not.
<s> Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
<s> Why?
<s> Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
<s> No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
<s> I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
<s> Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
<s> Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
<s> Yeah, I got it.
<s> What?
<s> Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
<s> You pick it.
<s> Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
<s> Yes.
<s> When?
<s> Where are you going?
<s> I want to have a baby.
<s> Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
<s> You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
<s> No.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
<s> Okay.
<s> Oh.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
<s> I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
<s> Make love?
<s> I can't stop thinking about you.
<s> Oddly enough, I do.
<s> That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
<s> Long day thinking.
<s> Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
<s> The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
<s> That's your look for me.
<s> Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
<s> And what are you like? A wino?
<s> I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
<s> I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
<s> Go back to sleep.
<s> I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
<s> Hi.
<s> 'kay.
<s> We haven't checked.
<s> Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
<s> Do you swear you didn't know?
<s> Can I... I brought some --
<s> Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
<s> Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
<s> Is that Nietzsche?
<s> It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
<s> It's no big deal.
<s> Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
<s> I have a family, Mary.
<s> The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
<s> That's fine, Stan.
<s> Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
<s> Then check the connections.
<s> She likes you okay.
<s> You can if you want.
<s> This one's history. Moving on...
<s> Patrick, we're in the middle of --
<s> Clockworks.
<s> Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
<s> Easy come, easy go.
<s> The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
<s> I'm staying with the Countess.
<s> Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
<s> Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
<s> 'Drugged' is a stupid word.
<s> Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
<s> I heard it.
<s> So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
<s> Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
<s> We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
<s> No, thank you.
<s> Hurry.
<s> I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
<s> I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
<s> Thank you.
<s> That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
<s> It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
<s> The dark inside me.
<s> Starck!
<s> This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.
<s> The crew? Could they still be alive?
<s> Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
<s> Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
<s> I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
<s> Do it.
<s> The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
<s> Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
<s> Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
<s> Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock.
<s> "Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
<s> The Core...!
<s> Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
<s> Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
<s> Yes...
<s> I don't know...
<s> Don't... don't do this...
<s> Then who the fuck are you?
<s> Better if I just show you.
<s> Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
<s> Something like that, yeah.
<s> That's enough!
<s> Captain, we got a problem.
<s> No, no, we just got her back together...
<s> We can take the filters from the Clark...
<s> To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
<s> Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
<s> Wasn't that ship destroyed?
<s> There's no one here.
<s> Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
<s> Picking up magnetic interference.
<s> I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
<s> The forward airlock.
<s> Relax, it's casual.
<s> "Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
<s> Victor did.
<s> Victor must've taken him.
<s> I don't care about rocks, I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
<s> You'd never know it.
<s> I'm sure he's matured since then.
<s> Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
<s> Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
<s> This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
<s> Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
<s> They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
<s> I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
<s> Give me the god damn mirror!
<s> And they're changing into...
<s> Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
<s> What about you?
<s> The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
<s> What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
<s> Okay, "mom."
<s> Blockhead started it!
<s> Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
<s> And if he's not...?
<s> That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
<s> Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
<s> What in the world would give me that idea?
<s> And reverse the mutations --
<s> With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
<s> No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
<s> Not at all.
<s> What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
<s> Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
<s> I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
<s> I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
<s> For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
<s> Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
<s> Later.
<s> I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
<s> Why?
<s> No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
<s> Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
<s> Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I know what I look like.
<s> What? Are you all right?
<s> Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
<s> What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
<s> No.
<s> The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
<s> I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
<s> All right. Pay attention.
<s> It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
<s> Whatever you say, Rat.
<s> They're fuckin' with us.
<s> All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
<s> Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
<s> Believe it.
<s> Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
<s> What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
<s> What's the big deal?
<s> Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
<s> Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
<s> You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
<s> No. But it's a nice idea.
<s> There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
<s> Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
<s> What do you want?
<s> He's not coming.
<s> He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
<s> Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
<s> Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
<s> Yes.
<s> It's John Bonham's birthday.
<s> Yes... It makes sense.
<s> Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
<s> Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
<s> WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
<s> Tell me. What do you want?
<s> Crying? Why was she crying?
<s> Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
<s> Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
<s> You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
<s> Dobermans don't talk.
<s> One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
<s> Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
<s> Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.
<s> You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
<s> How about a check?
<s> Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
<s> It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
<s> Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
<s> She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.
<s> It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
<s> You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
<s> Man, you don't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice!
<s> ...and every one of them stacked naked...
<s> FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
<s> Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
<s> How much is the lemon meringue pie?
<s> Never missed a plane yet.
<s> I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
<s> A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.
<s> How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
<s> Part of what?
<s> Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
<s> Where is everyone?
<s> Who the hell would you call?
<s> And the rest of 'em?
<s> My truck.
<s> We gotta try.
<s> Just cover me. It was built to move.
<s> Well...
<s> Oh.
<s> No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
<s> I can't feel a thing, Hon.
<s> What?
<s> He only shot you once.
<s> No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
<s> You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.
<s> Seven.
<s> They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
<s> Duh hickey.
<s> What?
<s> I'm fine! I'm fine!
<s> There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
<s> BONSAI!
<s> YOU'LL HIT US!
<s> Whoa!
<s> I said I'm not lying.
<s> But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
<s> Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
<s> But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
<s> I'm not!
<s> Huh.
<s> Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
<s> Sort of.
<s> Dick...
<s> You want his name?
<s> The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
<s> I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
<s> All square, Doc.
<s> I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
<s> Really?
<s> ...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
<s> Is Kaminski a Communist?
<s> And you think it's worth all this?
<s> I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
<s> No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
<s> Are you an actor?
<s> No, I don't hate it.
<s> ...Not if I can help it.
<s> Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
<s> Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
<s> I just wanted to see how you looked.
<s> You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
<s> What?
<s> Eight stories.
<s> Well, the studio told me not to.
<s> He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
<s> Calm down, Frances.
<s> Think I'll have a glass.
<s> Huh?
<s> Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
<s> Huh?
<s> What's that?
<s> I know. Don't tell anyone.
<s> No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
<s> Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
<s> Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
<s> Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
<s> I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
<s> I already have.
<s> Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
<s> Why are these all opened?
<s> Yes, Mama.
<s> I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
<s> Excuse me.
<s> It ain't for lack of trying.
<s> Please sit down...
<s> Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
<s> And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
<s> But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
<s> 'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
<s> What kindness?
<s> I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
<s> There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
<s> Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
<s> He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
<s> Is he not back yet?
<s> And you?
<s> But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
<s> A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
<s> Why the change? What about your work?
<s> It is
<s> Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
<s> Open this door for no-one!
<s> This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
<s> Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
<s> It's a letter to my father.
<s> Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
<s> He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
<s> Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
<s> A... week?
<s> Thank you, Henry.
<s> And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
<s> So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
<s> But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
<s> I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
<s> Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
<s> Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
<s> I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
<s> Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
<s> You okay?
<s> Artist.
<s> Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
<s> Not if they're where I think they are.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> Do you have a dime? A quarter?
<s> Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
<s> Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
<s> Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
<s> Where's Ned?
<s> Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
<s> Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
<s> Girls can't be cowboys.
<s> They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
<s> Sure.
<s> I meant me, my son and my daughter.
<s> Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?
<s> I'm exhausted.
<s> They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
<s> They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
<s> Jacob.
<s> What's this about, money?
<s> On the dresser.
<s> Scott and Kate.
<s> Yes, she is.
<s> You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
<s> You won't let him touch her?
<s> Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
<s> I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
<s> I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
<s> To yours.
<s> My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
<s> I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
<s> That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
<s> Anytime.
<s> Not many.
<s> -- you got your microwave --
<s> I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
<s> That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
<s> Six-fifty.
<s> You can't come in here.
<s> This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
<s> I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
<s> One... Two... Three.
<s> There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
<s> Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
<s> This ain't the time.
<s> Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
<s> When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
<s> Yeah, it's mine.
<s> He needs our help!
<s> More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.
<s> Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
<s> Standing right here in my office.
<s> Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain.
<s> If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
<s> It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
<s> I think you've resented me from the start, sir.
<s> I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself.
<s> Fuck me.
<s> I'll act surprised.
<s> Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.
<s> Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
<s> You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
<s> She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?
<s> This has nothing to do with you.
<s> It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
<s> Me?  Why me?
<s> Jordan.  You watch your ass.
<s> Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
<s> I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
<s> What about him.
<s> "Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."
<s> Thanks, Wick.
<s> You got anybody, Wick?
<s> Sure, sure.
<s> You heard me.  Move on.
<s> No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
<s> Shut up. How can you eat like that?
<s> Nearly four years...
<s> You must have quite some harem.
<s> You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.
<s> Sure. I'd like that.
<s> When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
<s> Really? I'd like to find out.
<s> We? I don't think so.
<s> No. Perhaps I work too much.
<s> I'll try.
<s> That is when we will go in.
<s> That's right.
<s> It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
<s> Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
<s> Why are you telling this to me?
<s> This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
<s> Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
<s> You were right.
<s> I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
<s> Uh uh! What did we talk about?
<s> "Just!?"
<s> Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
<s> We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
<s> I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
<s> ...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
<s> All this from watching the.. historical records?
<s> Excuse me guys.
<s> We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
<s> Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
<s> We'd never have the budget for this.
<s> What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
<s> Never mind, Fred....
<s> Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
<s> Tell them? About...
<s> Computer, can it be repaired?
<s> Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
<s> Why does this sound so familiar?
<s> Turn on the translation circuit.
<s> What the hell are you talking about?
<s> Gwen...
<s> Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
<s> Stop, please! I don't know!
<s> Gwen. The show. There's no choice. Do it.
<s> I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
<s> You what?.. What are you talking about?
<s> I think we're going to exit the space port.
<s> Push It. Hold it down.
<s> Oh god...
<s> What kind of signal?
<s> Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
<s> How about the pig-lizard?
<s> It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
<s> Commander?... Call me Laredo?
<s> Patience, Lt. . Patience.
<s> The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
<s> Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
<s> Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
<s> We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
<s> Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
<s> Couldn't you have appealed to Congress?
<s> Cut those men down.  Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial.  Benedict, trust me to handle this.
<s> Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
<s> None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
<s> Yes, my lord.
<s> Lafayette will not be happy...
<s> That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
<s> Delighted, sir.
<s> They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant.  Then, they start coming back to us.
<s> Yes, I believe so.
<s> I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
<s> If he isn't, then he's stupid.
<s> These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
<s> The British Army is right back there, across that river!  Sir!  I think it must be something else that detains General Lee.
<s> Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!
<s> Yes, I will write him and tell his ministers and the court.
<s> Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
<s> We're leaving them?
<s> I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I.
<s> Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me.  Maybe I will let you down yet.
<s> I'm with Captain Hamilton.
<s> Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
<s> You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!
<s> I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.
<s> They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
<s> You know very well who it is that I love.
<s> But not more than your comfort.
<s> Those people?  I doubt they'd think of this.  Ooo, you're wonderful this color!
<s> God damn you, Sam Adams!  You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we've really got one it scares you more than it does the British!
<s> This, this is life indeed!  Life worth preserving, Such life as Juba never felt till now.
<s> Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
<s> I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
<s> Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
<s> Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.
<s> Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
<s> You're right.
<s> Not too bad.
<s> No shit? What're some of 'em?
<s> I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
<s> There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
<s> Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.
<s> First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
<s> It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
<s> Leo, I don't know.
<s> What I been wondering is where's he been.
<s> I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
<s> Depends. Who's this?
<s> Okay. So who are you?
<s> Who?
<s> Or else use your fucking imagination.
<s> That's correct. Look at me.
<s> 'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
<s> That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
<s> What've you got?
<s> Why do I have to keep looking at you?
<s> Fuckin' basketball game.
<s> You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
<s> Once.
<s> Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
<s> Who?
<s> Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
<s> Ask your man here.
<s> They report it to the IRS.
<s> I'm up twelve grand today.
<s> Who told you that?
<s> I'll find you, Leo...
<s> I know what a vig is.
<s> What're you doing here?
<s> Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
<s> I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
<s> Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
<s> I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
<s> That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
<s> Don't say a fuckin' word.
<s> Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
<s> Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
<s> You don't? What happened to Muff?
<s> That's where you got the idea?
<s> Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
<s> No problem. You go on off to bed.
<s> Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
<s> I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
<s> Roger, Arctic Warrior. I say again, our records indicate the passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea. Over.
<s> Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coast Guard North Island Station. Over and out.
<s> They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
<s> Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
<s> Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
<s> Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
<s> Gimme a break.
<s> Then what the hell happened to him?
<s> Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
<s> Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
<s> It's a risk I'm willing to take.
<s> How long to fix?
<s> Like I always say --
<s> I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
<s> What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
<s> The sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours.
<s> And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
<s> Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
<s> Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
<s> So whoever did this might still be around.
<s> What is it?
<s> How do you mean?
<s> You smashed it!
<s> Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
<s> Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
<s> Nothing. Let's get outa here.
<s> They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
<s> Yeah. Thanks.
<s> Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
<s> Did you see him?
<s> It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
<s> But where's the damage?
<s> If it was a ship she hit.
<s> Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
<s> Doesn't matter.
<s> Showing you what?
<s> If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
<s> We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
<s> I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
<s> Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
<s> We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
<s> The mooring hasn't come taught.
<s> Better late than never.
<s> YES.
<s> Are you going to yell at me?
<s> Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
<s> Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
<s> It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.
<s> Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
<s> What do you mean?
<s> But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
<s> Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm almost done.
<s> In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
<s> Yeah, well... hi...
<s> You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
<s> Forget it...
<s> Just look at them!
<s> Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
<s> You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
<s> I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
<s> Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
<s> He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
<s> Gross!
<s> I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
<s> Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
<s> Where did you get that?
<s> Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
<s> I dunno, but next week is my last class...
<s> That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
<s> Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
<s> Do you still want to do something tonight?
<s> Nothing.
<s> I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
<s> Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!
<s> Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
<s> Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.
<s> That's okay...
<s> That's not even --
<s> A dollar seventy-five.
<s> I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
<s> Good luck...
<s> Yeah, well...
<s> Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --
<s> Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
<s> Fine, I'll go by myself then...
<s> Shh!
<s> Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
<s> Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
<s> But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
<s> Hooray for me.
<s> Yeah, but still...
<s> I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
<s> Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
<s> Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
<s> How can you be so sure?
<s> What, are you trying to get rid of me?
<s> Does that mean you don't like me?
<s> Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
<s> Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
<s> Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
<s> But, I...
<s> Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
<s> Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
<s> Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
<s> What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
<s> Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
<s> Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!
<s> Yes?
<s> You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
<s> Am I to take it you want to live?
<s> I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
<s> But I have in India- every country presents problems.
<s> I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
<s> But overall, you're pleased?
<s> Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
<s> I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.
<s> I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
<s> Shhh.
<s> But you said they were always old.
<s> You mean nobody died?
<s> No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
<s> Don't they have to be?...
<s> The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
<s> I expect so- it's from my wife.
<s> I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it.
<s> Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
<s> I'd rather not.
<s> Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
<s> Didn't I do it?
<s> You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
<s> There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?
<s> Oscar!  You poor kid!
<s> As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
<s> Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
<s> How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
<s> Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
<s> I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
<s> Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
<s> I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
<s> It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
<s> Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
<s> No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
<s> Tonight?
<s> I know.
<s> Who are they?
<s> Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
<s> Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
<s> You need the exercise.
<s> This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
<s> They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
<s> Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
<s> This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
<s> Something good --
<s> There's something very familiar about this painting.
<s> I'm Peter --
<s> You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
<s> I hate Jello.
<s> Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
<s> Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
<s> Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
<s> It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
<s> What?  Yeah.
<s> Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
<s> Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
<s> Wonder what?
<s> Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
<s> Uuuuuuugh!!
<s> Eight o'clock?
<s> Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
<s> No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.
<s> Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
<s> All right.
<s> The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
<s> Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
<s> Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
<s> No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
<s> I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
<s> Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
<s> I don't believe in luck.
<s> I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
<s> Yes, it would.
<s> Why do you want to see it?
<s> Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
<s> I'm always serious.
<s> Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
<s> Get a grip on yourself, Egon.  I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.
<s> Full-stream with strogon pulse.
<s> No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
<s> We'd better adjust our streams.
<s> What do I say?
<s> Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
<s> Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
<s> Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
<s> So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
<s> Where are you, Pete?
<s> Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
<s> No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
<s> Right.  We'll believe anything.
<s> I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
<s> And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
<s> Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?
<s> I'm sure, I don't know.
<s> Why not do it in the Colosseum?
<s> That's difficult to say, general.
<s> The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!
<s> Only from a distance.
<s> I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
<s> They fear me.
<s> What deal?
<s> The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
<s> Can you stop that slaughter?!  Can you free these men?
<s> I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
<s> Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
<s> You teach them!
<s> I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
<s> I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
<s> Oh, shit.  Take your time!  Don't get suckered!  This man is a murderer!  In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  Please, just take the fall!
<s> I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
<s> Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
<s> You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Wait a minute.
<s> Yes.
<s> You do?
<s> I've never been to it.
<s> No.
<s> I thought he said by the monkey house.
<s> Here he comes.
<s> I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.
<s> I just don't think it would...
<s> Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
<s> Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
<s> Thank you.
<s> -- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
<s> Is what a girl?
<s> Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
<s> Why not?
<s> Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
<s> What?
<s> All right. Now finish your drink.
<s> Jesus Christ!
<s> Very well. Thank you.
<s> Benjamin.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Benjamin.
<s> I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
<s> No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
<s> That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
<s> Well what do you want to talk about?
<s> How about art.
<s> Neither.
<s> I walk out.
<s> Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
<s> No.
<s> See if you can guess.
<s> Why are you asking me all this?
<s> Kind of.
<s> Don't talk about Elaine?
<s> Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
<s> Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
<s> Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
<s> Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
<s> Then you'd better start believing me.
<s> I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
<s> Yes, but I'm afraid --
<s> What?
<s> No, I do. I want to tell you.
<s> Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
<s> Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
<s> Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
<s> Not if you don't want to.
<s> Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
<s> Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
<s> Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
<s> I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
<s> No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
<s> Ben, can I say something to you?
<s> I will.
<s> I will.
<s> Mrs. Robinson?
<s> I'd like to discuss this.
<s> It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
<s> The pearls are in her room.
<s> Why?
<s> How?
<s> Who?
<s> Have you seen it?
<s> Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
<s> Money -- Ever heard of it?
<s> Very little.
<s> Would you like to make a man happy?
<s> I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
<s> Yes -- oh!
<s> What do you want here?
<s> I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
<s> You mustn't talk Russian to me.
<s> Yes -- I do understand.
<s> Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
<s> I want to be alone.
<s> I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
<s> Yes -- yes -- yes.
<s> I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
<s> I'm Baron von Gaigern.
<s> Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
<s> No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
<s> Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
<s> Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again... 
<s> Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
<s> How's the beautiful lady?
<s> If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
<s> No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
<s> Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
<s> I did not ask your advice.
<s> No -- letters to two-eighty.
<s> Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
<s> Nobody, Doctor.
<s> You are ill.
<s> Everything?
<s> More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
<s> Stay where you are.
<s> Oh, don't go.
<s> I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
<s> Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
<s> I didn't like Preysing right off.
<s> Moreover...
<s> Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
<s> Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
<s> Have you got it now?
<s> Definitely off.
<s> Here, hold up!
<s> Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
<s> You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
<s> And I said we didn't.
<s> Next week.
<s> Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told.  Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
<s> Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
<s> Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
<s> Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov? 
<s> I'm cancelling the engagement.
<s> Why not?
<s> Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
<s> -- We must do something...
<s> No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
<s> I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
<s> Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself.  There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
<s> I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
<s> I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
<s> Bobo, no, I --
<s> I never fucked up before, Bobo.
<s> And if you do it wrong?
<s> Hah.
<s> Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?
<s> And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
<s> We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
<s> What? He's going to be all right!
<s> You know who I work for.
<s> I know.
<s> But what's wrong?
<s> What is?
<s> But they must be! They cut glass!
<s> It's not your fault.
<s> Just myself.
<s> I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
<s> Oh, sure. Fine.
<s> Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...
<s> Fair enough.
<s> I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
<s> My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
<s> No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
<s> I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
<s> Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
<s> And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
<s> ) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
<s> You taught me a lot. Then I invented.
<s> Taking you for granite?
<s> Are you sure?
<s> You called the doctor, huh?
<s> That's just Lilly's way.
<s> Oh, don't be stupid.
<s> You ain't seen nothin.
<s> See you soon.
<s> I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
<s> Oh, come on, Roy.
<s> I'm a salesman.
<s> Myra, I'm not following this.
<s> The long end. Big con.
<s> And when he got serious?
<s> What happened to Cole?
<s> I saw her.
<s> I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
<s> You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
<s> No! Because I --
<s> ) What?
<s> Not many.
<s> Oh, yeah. That's that.
<s> Happy to see you looking so good.
<s> Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
<s> It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
<s> Care to join me?
<s> Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
<s> Do I know you?
<s> Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
<s> My office?
<s> Betcha' didn't predict that.
<s> And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
<s> Will, sit down...
<s> Get on the bus.
<s> Please, get on the bus...
<s> Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
<s> Oh, right.  Sorry.
<s> Where's Shane?
<s> Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
<s> He's in the bathroom.
<s> Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
<s> But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
<s> Then they can watch.
<s> Relax, John.  They were just kids.
<s> You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara.
<s> A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
<s> Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
<s> Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
<s> Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
<s> It's not working!
<s> After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
<s> Or what's left of him.
<s> An old friend.
<s> Any word on the location of the Strodes?
<s> Samhain.
<s> Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?
<s> I dunno, boy.
<s> You know what gets me?
<s> Oh, shit.
<s> It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
<s> The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
<s> Let's talk about it some other time.
<s> She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
<s> The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
<s> Tit for tat--as simple as that.
<s> They were enemies.  We were at war.
<s> You've come to the right man.
<s> Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
<s> Out!
<s> As a matter of fact--I am home.
<s> Is anybody besides you here now?
<s> "Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
<s> Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
<s> He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
<s> Wow.
<s> Mhravitch.
<s> And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."
<s> When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
<s> Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
<s> Will you go to bed?
<s> Make it fast.
<s> You're free to go to her, if you want.  If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word.
<s> No.
<s> Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
<s> Daughter--I love you very much.
<s> You are woman.  I know woman well.
<s> I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
<s> Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
<s> Situation.
<s> Shouldn't you lie down?
<s> You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
<s> I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
<s> His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
<s> No you're not!
<s> More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
<s> He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
<s> If he thinks he's man enough.
<s> If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
<s> Don't!
<s> Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
<s> There it is.  Give it to me.
<s> The National Safety Council would be appalled.
<s> You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
<s> Oh dear.
<s> Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
<s> I came back.
<s> Would you say that again?
<s> I've never heard of it.
<s> You haven't heard me yet.
<s> Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
<s> You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
<s> Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
<s> Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
<s> I've enjoyed being man.
<s> Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
<s> What will you do, Colonel?
<s> Premature ejaculation.
<s> And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
<s> Don't!
<s> Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
<s> A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
<s> Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
<s> Doing what?
<s> Something happens to my confidence.
<s> That's when I'll get my confidence back.
<s> It's suicide!
<s> Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
<s> None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
<s> You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
<s> Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve, let him rage.  There has never been a funeral for his father.
<s> We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
<s> Mozart plays shuffleboard.
<s> Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come.
<s> But is she, has...
<s> Wait?
<s> How many weeks?
<s> Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
<s> What's that shade of blue called?
<s> Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
<s> Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
<s> I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.
<s> Do you know where she lives?
<s> Do you know where she would be?
<s> Yeah.  I'm her father.
<s> Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
<s> You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
<s> 'Sucking off.'
<s> You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
<s> But it's all you do.
<s> They believe in the 'TULIP.'
<s> So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
<s> Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
<s> So then, Mr. Mast...
<s> ...What do you have to offer?
<s> If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.
<s> And better?
<s> I'm back in Grand Rapids.
<s> Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
<s> Where is she?
<s> Who made it?
<s> Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
<s> Get out.
<s> I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
<s> Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
<s> They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
<s> Pretty good.
<s> What is going on?
<s> No.
<s> Okay.
<s> Good.
<s> Ratan!
<s> What?
<s> Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
<s> I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
<s> Well, he can just fuck himself.
<s> 'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
<s> Yes, I am.
<s> You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
<s> Possession of a stolen shovel.
<s> Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
<s> Lady! Be quiet.
<s> What kind of a car is it?
<s> I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.
<s> What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.
<s> And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
<s> Well, then, you must come back and visit.
<s> My door is always open.
<s> Promise?
<s> Oh, it's fine. Fine.
<s> Yes. Very much.
<s> Look, the ice is melting.
<s> Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
<s> Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
<s> Yes.
<s> Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
<s> It's all right.  It's organic.
<s> It's so blue.
<s> Well, why don't you?
<s> Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
<s> Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
<s> Well, don't go.
<s> Maude, do you think you can help me?
<s> ... of you. You'll all end up like this.
<s> No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
<s> We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
<s> They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
<s> Can't complain.
<s> Why?
<s> What about the draft?
<s> No.
<s> Yes.
<s> I burnt down the Chemistry building.
<s> No.  I'd have liked to.
<s> I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
<s> Thank you, Uncle.
<s> Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
<s> Well, I don't...
<s> Harold!
<s> Harold!
<s> Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
<s> Julia.
<s> I knew you'd come.
<s> You a doctor, too?
<s> So you slept O.K.?
<s> Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
<s> God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.
<s> Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.
<s> Yeah. The things you were talking about.
<s> Kyle, you don't have...
<s> No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
<s> No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
<s> See what??
<s> I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
<s> Didn't even buy me a drink.
<s> Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
<s> See? I don't like that --
<s> Is it bad?
<s> That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
<s> Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
<s> Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
<s> Who?!
<s> Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
<s> I knew those men better than you did --
<s> That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
<s> Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
<s> My arm is fine. Where are you??
<s> Hostage negotiations.
<s> On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
<s> Alone?
<s> Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
<s> Red, I --
<s> Cocky.
<s> Coffee's warming me up.
<s> What?
<s> We're leaving.
<s> Do you really need this bed, lady?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Her mother's dead.
<s> Who are you?
<s> Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
<s> You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
<s> HE did. I've seen him.
<s> You can keep them.
<s> Poor baby.
<s> That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
<s> I don't want to see the dress.
<s> Ssh!
<s> Hurting.
<s> Not know.
<s> Yes. They'll never find us.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
<s> I have to see my father.
<s> Like who?
<s> Ah!
<s> You mean we're moving in?
<s> I'll be scarred for life.
<s> Are you O.K.?
<s> Fine.
<s> No. I'll do it.
<s> There's a first time for everything.
<s> You want something to drink?
<s> I... suppose so, yes.
<s> Yeah, why don't I?
<s> I won't be a moment.
<s> My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
<s> I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
<s> Steve.
<s> I said: I found a room.
<s> Of course.
<s> I want to see.
<s> No. It's all over.
<s> I have to get out.
<s> I thought we'd lost you.
<s> Please. I want to see you home. All right?
<s> What things?
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
<s> Say it.
<s> Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
<s> But now I kind of like it.
<s> I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
<s> Ehh.
<s> Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
<s> Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
<s> Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
<s> I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
<s> We're getting that anyway.
<s> Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
<s> It's the new --
<s> No.  The Righteous Brothers.
<s> Nothing.
<s> You can be and are wrong.
<s> Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
<s> I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
<s> Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
<s> Pardon me?
<s> What do you mean, four more?
<s> Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
<s> Nice friend.
<s> Yeah, sure...
<s> Can I help you?
<s> Fine.
<s> -- FUCK OFF!
<s> You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
<s> It's Vince and Justin.
<s> You look upset.
<s> I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
<s> I dunno.
<s> I thought I could give you a lift back.
<s> No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
<s> Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
<s> Just ask it!
<s> It's me.
<s> I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
<s> Is that the last of it?
<s> I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
<s> I hate him too.  So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
<s> Oh ho, so very infrequently.
<s> Those aren't mine.
<s> Well, think about it.
<s> I can't talk right now.
<s> Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
<s> No, but...
<s> You're tougher.
<s> And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
<s> Are you persuadable?
<s> This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
<s> Enough of what?
<s> Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
<s> Yes.  You?
<s> Whiskey.
<s> I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
<s> And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
<s> Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
<s> It's the best collection I've ever seen.
<s> I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
<s> Fine.
<s> Why?
<s> The boy _died_?
<s> Probably.
<s> Tradition.
<s> Have you gone to the police?
<s> You are being foolish.
<s> Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
<s> It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
<s> Yes.
<s> At least.
<s> That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
<s> What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
<s> You killed those other two.
<s> You kill with your left hand?
<s> Is that a threat?
<s> I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't stand it!
<s> You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
<s> You and I should talk first.
<s> It'll never stick.
<s> You're an asshole, Moran.
<s> What's all of this got to do with me?
<s> I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
<s> -In nomine sanctus esperitu-
<s> And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
<s> You are the same?
<s> It is less.
<s> Not even a single lifetime.
<s> This is madness!
<s> This can't be.
<s> All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.
<s> You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
<s> Romirez is dust.
<s> We need more time.
<s> Who do you think I am?  One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  "Threaten you"?  You and I just living will always be a threat.  Forever.  Look at your life, Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there but threat.  Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for.
<s> Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
<s> Kahn?
<s> Head still secure to the neck.
<s> -Since you last saw me.
<s> My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
<s> Yes.
<s> Do you?
<s> No.
<s> Just your pappy scared some.
<s> The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
<s> Hildy!
<s> What's the idea of locking this?
<s> Au revoir, mon capitaine.
<s> Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
<s> He certainly -- hic -- does!
<s> Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
<s> On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
<s> Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
<s> But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
<s> Hello, Bruce...
<s> Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
<s> We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
<s> Where'd she go?
<s> No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
<s> 
<s> Oh.
<s> Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
<s> That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!
<s> Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
<s> Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
<s> And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
<s> And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
<s> Thanks a lot.
<s> And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
<s> You'll ask me to what?
<s> Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!
<s> The power of the press, huh!
<s> Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
<s> Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
<s> No!
<s> Get away, Svengali.
<s> Look at this! 
<s> Where'd you meet this man?
<s> The insurance business?
<s> Now you got me.
<s> How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
<s> Thank you.
<s> So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
<s> Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
<s> I know. Where is he, I said.
<s> You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
<s> Where's some paper?
<s> What tickets?
<s> Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
<s> When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
<s> That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
<s> Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
<s> It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
<s> Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
<s> Walter!
<s> What's the matter with my brains?
<s> Walter, you can't do that!
<s> What's that -- what's that?
<s> I was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. They were hiding him!
<s> What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
<s> What?
<s> You're crazy. Where's Mac?
<s> Me, too.
<s> A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
<s> Three bullets! Any good?
<s> Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
<s> Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
<s> This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
<s> What's the use? I can't win a pot.
<s> Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
<s> What's the dope, Sheriff?
<s> Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
<s> No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.
<s> Let go o' me. What's the idea?
<s> Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
<s> What do I know about Williams?
<s> Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
<s> Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.
<s> You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
<s> No, I couldn't do that.
<s> We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'.
<s> Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
<s> How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
<s> Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
<s> Throw him out, Frank.
<s> That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
<s> Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
<s> Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
<s> Now, Hildy --
<s> What did you do with her?
<s> Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
<s> I'll go right after it.
<s> Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
<s> How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
<s> Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
<s> Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
<s> Very simple, Earl.
<s> Wait a minute, Mollie.
<s> Quiet, Mollie!
<s> The what?
<s> You mean here in the city?
<s> Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
<s> You're insane!
<s> -- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
<s> I give that marriage six months.
<s> Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
<s> I know.
<s> Who told you that?
<s> I only know one.
<s> Bugger off, you bloody sod.
<s> ...and four and five...
<s> They might be.
<s> And absent bridegrooms!
<s> What's that?
<s> I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
<s> Out.
<s> It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
<s> Play something, Grace.
<s> A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
<s> We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
<s> And now we're glad you did.
<s> Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
<s> What?
<s> I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
<s> Where's that?
<s> Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.
<s> A dead one.
<s> Are you two gals all funny with each other?
<s> I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
<s> You shouldn't a done that.
<s> Now, what makes you think that?
<s> Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
<s> Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
<s> Yeah, no shit.
<s> Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
<s> Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
<s> I'll help ya.
<s> There's not enough room.
<s> Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
<s> I gotta open the gate.
<s> What I need are some answers. 
<s> Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
<s> Grab Mary and come inside.
<s> When?
<s> Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
<s> I don't know, I think he's funny.
<s> I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
<s> No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
<s> I don't know... about half an hour.
<s> Shhhhhh, quiet.
<s> Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
<s> A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
<s> His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
<s> Huh?
<s> Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
<s> I ain't got a warrant.
<s> That's it?
<s> Dr. Satan?
<s> Right.
<s> Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
<s> How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
<s> Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
<s> Great.  God, I've wanted you forever.
<s> Like father, like son.
<s> I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
<s> Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
<s> Not in front of the boy.
<s> You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
<s> That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
<s> Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
<s> I don't know.
<s> But I like being human now.
<s> I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
<s> But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
<s> I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
<s> One night stand?
<s> I have a friend you might like to meet.
<s> Nathan told my brother.
<s> I'm really glad you two found each other.
<s> That's not necessarily a bad thing.
<s> Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
<s> Yes, darling.
<s> Yes.
<s> If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
<s> What?
<s> Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
<s> My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
<s> I had sold my fucking soul.
<s> Should I come with?
<s> Ummm. It's good.
<s> Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
<s> Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
<s> Bravo, Puff! Bravo!
<s> And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
<s> It would be my pleasure, doctor.  Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to...
<s> Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
<s> Unka unka unka unka unka.
<s> I have to talk. Is that okay?
<s> Soon as I finish my coffee.
<s> I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
<s> Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?
<s> We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
<s> It's possible.
<s> I lost twenty bucks.
<s> What's that supposed to mean?
<s> To do what?
<s> That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
<s> There are places. I'll scuffle around.
<s> Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
<s> I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
<s> I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
<s> I said we're leavin'.
<s> I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
<s> And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
<s> In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
<s> Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
<s> You well-heeled, partner?
<s> Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
<s> Fast and loose, man.
<s> Charlie, I'm gonna take him.
<s> Eddie...
<s> You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
<s> A son.
<s> Talk to me, Charlie.
<s> Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
<s> Aw, Eddie.
<s> Yeah. Just like that.
<s> Well, hello. Haven't seen you in a long time.
<s> You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
<s> Okay?
<s> Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
<s> Half and a dollar.
<s> A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
<s> You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
<s> Since four.
<s> What bus?
<s> I'm not.
<s> No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
<s> The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
<s> I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
<s> Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
<s> No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
<s> What's this supposed to mean: "We have a contract of depravity. All we have to do is pull the blinds down."
<s> You wanna drink?
<s> What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
<s> Is he a winner?
<s> Does it bother you? What he said?
<s> Come here. Come on, now.
<s> No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
<s> Well, what's the matter?
<s> You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota Fats is the best in the country out where I come from.
<s> California. Oakland.
<s> Nine ball.  Three ball.
<s> Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
<s> Game's over, Eddie.
<s> You watch me.
<s> That's good, Eddie. For how much?
<s> Listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could find some way to --
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Have you looked inside?
<s> Who?
<s> That's fine.
<s> You got that right.
<s> This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
<s> What did it look like?
<s> I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
<s> Yes.  I can even read star maps.
<s> Behind my house, up on the ridge.
<s> Hide the car.
<s> I know a way.
<s> What? -- I... 
<s> He's a good man.
<s> All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
<s> More than likely.
<s> I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
<s> So sue me.
<s> We've tried. It's not working. It's almost as though they weren't even there.
<s> And the good news is you won't charge me.
<s> Haven't you been watching?
<s> Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
<s> That signal. It's a countdown.
<s> They don't know this.
<s> Dad...
<s> I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
<s> You can do that?
<s> Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
<s> Moishe, please, don't talk.
<s> I'm making a mess.
<s> We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
<s> Oh shit, we're late.
<s> Then God help us.
<s> She should be shortly.
<s> The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
<s> Better than we thought.
<s> Roger.
<s> How long would their shields be down?
<s> No Sir. Definitely not.
<s> They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
<s> Yeah, but what an entrance!
<s> I thought you didn't recognize me.
<s> I didn't even see them fire!
<s> I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
<s> We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
<s> The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
<s> Many worlds...
<s> You are on your own?
<s> And I am his.
<s> It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
<s> Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
<s> It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
<s> I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
<s> That was our assessment as well.
<s> My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
<s> We're through!
<s> Yes?
<s> I usually don't.
<s> In that case, I permit you.
<s> But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
<s> I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
<s> How do you know?
<s> I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
<s> I can reach it. I can reach it...
<s> Out!
<s> And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
<s> Good point.
<s> He was actually there? You saw him?
<s> Yeah?
<s> So did I.
<s> Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
<s> What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
<s> What?
<s> What final challenge?
<s> Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
<s> I was the next man.
<s> Dad, how can you?
<s> It happens to me all the time.
<s> The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
<s> If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
<s> Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The British Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.
<s> I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
<s> No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
<s> Finally!
<s> It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
<s> No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
<s> His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
<s> Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
<s> I don't like to show off.
<s> At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
<s> Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
<s> It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
<s> That's it. Pankot Palace.
<s> Poison never agrees with me.  Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!
<s> Siam.
<s> Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
<s> First of all -- don't panic!
<s> Just one arm!
<s> It's starting to let go!
<s> Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.
<s> Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
<s> Maybe he likes older women.
<s> It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.
<s> I'm going down.
<s> You've got to go to sleep now.
<s> There's got to be another way out.
<s> Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
<s> And they don't even know what it really is.
<s> You're not gonna believe this...
<s> Me.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> What is your name?
<s> Where are we?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
<s> Me? What'd I do?
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Outrun them.
<s> No. Don't tell the guards.
<s> Find You?
<s> I'll sue.
<s> See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
<s> With Authority!
<s> I'm at the airport.
<s> We get on a plane.
<s> Use my credit cards.
<s> You are in trouble. Now do it.
<s> We'll change your appearance.
<s> The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
<s> Eat it.
<s> Why not?
<s> For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
<s> She's beautiful...! What do I do?
<s> What can I do? You're on your own.
<s> Wait.
<s> Where are you staying?
<s> I made it work.
<s> Are you serious?
<s> What if she says something important?
<s> Oh come on.
<s> It wasn't like that.
<s> Why don't you get out of my face.
<s> Osaka?
<s> Follow her.
<s> That's not funny.
<s> You think. That's what you're good at.
<s> Don't worry!
<s> I can't see a thing.
<s> haka xuki. What's that mean?
<s> While he makes the run.
<s> ...Shit! It's just money.
<s> Looks like you can have all you want.
<s> I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
<s> I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
<s> I'll get us out of here.
<s> Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
<s> RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
<s> What part what?
<s> Do what? What'd you do?
<s> Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
<s> **?!! 
<s> We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
<s> They took the tapes.
<s> We don't even know where to start. What about these people? What do we do with them?
<s> Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
<s> We insist.
<s> I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all.
<s> Oh.
<s> What things?
<s> Remember what?
<s> Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
<s> Oh yeah, thanks...
<s> No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
<s> I noticed you staring.
<s> Thanks, I appreciate that.
<s> Oh...I can't. Business.
<s> Without what?
<s> Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
<s> Like there's someone else here.
<s> Why?
<s> It's not apparent.
<s> Wanted to get to know you.
<s> They kidded me a little.
<s> What's he done?
<s> One chip?
<s> Get your things.
<s> It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
<s> We figure out if it's in here.
<s> Hong Kong.
<s> That I really don't know.
<s> Why?
<s> I'll come back for you.
<s> ...Piece of mind.
<s> Why not?
<s> Tear it apart?
<s> What does he know?
<s> Okay.
<s> She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
<s> She was playing with the Pooh doll.
<s> I heard them.
<s> Lowell?
<s> Monday.
<s> Because he has to reveal it in a court of law. It's on record, it's out. It's no secret anymore. So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate? It's out in the world...
<s> Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
<s> ...fuck is this? Fuck!
<s> Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?
<s> Maybe later.
<s> Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
<s> End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
<s> No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
<s> I'm not touching my film...
<s> No, I'm not...
<s> Before you go...
<s> No, no, we're fine...
<s> I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
<s> You're sure you want to do this?
<s> Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
<s> I didn't want to leave it there...
<s> I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
<s> Thomas Sandefur...
<s> I'm doing an interview.
<s> Who's calling?
<s> Jeffrey...
<s> Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is "no." I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio.  That decision I've already made.
<s> Alright. What did you think?
<s> No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
<s> You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.
<s> Everything interests me.
<s> That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please.
<s> Black, black...
<s> Far as you go where?
<s> And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
<s> Tempura...
<s> ...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
<s> They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
<s> They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it.
<s> I'll call them, Lowell.
<s> Yeah, great.
<s> What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...!
<s> What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!
<s> I told the truth... I told the truth.
<s> And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
<s> Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
<s> There is -- there is no family.
<s> Liane has filed for divorce...
<s> And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
<s> When should we do this?
<s> Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
<s> Well, I wouldn't say --
<s> I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
<s> Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
<s> Here. Got pictures.
<s> We'd better go before we get thrown out.
<s> You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...  I like my women with two boobs.
<s> Who's the pigeon?
<s> So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
<s> What?
<s> So, that's good, right?
<s> No.
<s> I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.
<s> It's about time.
<s> Why would you be here?
<s> Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
<s> That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
<s> But why him?
<s> I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
<s> Thank you.
<s> And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
<s> Yes.
<s> Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
<s> On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
<s> You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
<s> So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
<s> Hello Miles.
<s> You used his credit card.
<s> Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
<s> Of Massey Myerson?
<s> Well what does he want?
<s> They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
<s> Hello Miles.
<s> Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
<s> She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
<s> Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
<s> ...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
<s> Thank you.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
<s> She always looked out for me.
<s> She brought my digestive enzymes.
<s> No. You're not.
<s> Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
<s> She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
<s> Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
<s> Who's "Patty."
<s> She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
<s> You're a peculiar chap.
<s> She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every daywhether it's coming to her or not.
<s> You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
<s> If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
<s> I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
<s> Oh, yes. I heard.
<s> Nothing. 
<s> It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
<s> Why? Do you know him? 
<s> Lower the boats!
<s> Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye. 
<s> I haven't the slightest idea.
<s> What do they say?
<s> But the lady says
<s> Huh?
<s> Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.  What time is the next bus to New York?
<s> I didn't ask for your advice. 
<s> Shut up!
<s> I kind of half expected you to thank me.
<s> Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but you've been very kind. 
<s> Um. You're doing all right.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story?
<s> I refuse to resign!
<s> Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old womana trip like this.
<s> Why, haven't you?
<s> Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
<s> My uncleMother's brotherhad four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
<s> And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
<s> Raw?
<s> No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
<s> You're an expert, I suppose.
<s> Mind your own business.
<s> Darling!
<s> I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself.  Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you.  Oh, Peter
<s> Same to you.
<s> Yep! The Walls of Jericho. 
<s> Not interested. 
<s> Left twenty minutes ago.
<s> Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
<s> That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
<s> You mean about the Andrews' kid?
<s> Never mind . . . Listensuppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
<s> That she's going to marry somebody else.
<s> Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
<s> Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
<s> They're married all right. I just seen the license.
<s> Yeah?
<s> I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is"  No, do you really?
<s> Collect?
<s> He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
<s> Said he was gonna stay a week.
<s> Yeah, you'll have to git .
<s> Zeke.  Git!
<s> That's right.
<s> Why?
<s> Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, seeand
<s> The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
<s> Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
<s> You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
<s> Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
<s> Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
<s> No, I'm not...
<s> Go on, Willie.
<s> Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
<s> Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
<s> Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
<s> Dave?
<s> Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
<s> I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
<s> Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
<s> You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
<s> Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
<s> Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it.
<s> Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
<s> I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
<s> Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
<s> No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.
<s> No, you don't!
<s> I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
<s> Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
<s> This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
<s> A Perry Russo?
<s> No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
<s> I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
<s> Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
<s> Take a look across the street.
<s> Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
<s> Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
<s> I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
<s> Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
<s> Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
<s> Anything more specific, Jack?  It's important.
<s> Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
<s> We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
<s> Splendid, love to see them.
<s> Germany.
<s> If you must know, virtually nothing.
<s> Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
<s> If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
<s> Three years.
<s> I need a favor.
<s> A bit.
<s> I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
<s> Hey, Jackie.
<s> She wants to go back to work.
<s> Arrest me.
<s> What's in it?
<s> Take your time.
<s> 'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
<s> It's kind of a sports bar
<s> Shit.
<s> Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
<s> The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
<s> Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
<s> Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
<s> I am. Have a seat.
<s> I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
<s> You went out this morning and bought a gun?
<s> Why?
<s> No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
<s> If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
<s> You're not old. You look great.
<s> Right around here, in the food court.
<s> You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
<s> A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
<s> And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
<s> Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
<s> That's my job.
<s> I believe I said I'd be tempted.
<s> Do you think they bought it?
<s> You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
<s> Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
<s> That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
<s> Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
<s> Less ten percent.
<s> What's he doing?
<s> Did you tell him you were leaving?
<s> Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
<s> Not every day?
<s> You planted that shit on me.
<s> It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
<s> You talk to him?
<s> If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
<s> Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
<s> You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
<s> Not in the fitting room.
<s> Keep it between us girls?
<s> I didn't tell 'em anything.
<s> Yeah, I think a woman.
<s> And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
<s> Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
<s> Man, I don't like that part.
<s> If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Yeah, there's another hit left.
<s> What's a Metrix?
<s> The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
<s> Who's arm is that?
<s> Yeah.
<s> So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
<s> Does that bother you?
<s> Uh-huh?
<s> Okay, Lou-is.
<s> Then what?
<s> Which one is for the car?
<s> What do I do?
<s> I'm in my underwear.
<s> But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.
<s> That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
<s> I shot her.
<s> Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
<s> The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
<s> We went to the parking lot.
<s> How am I supposed to know that?
<s> Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
<s> Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
<s> Watcha gonna see?
<s> Cost you a thousand for the bond.
<s> Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
<s> Hear what?
<s> You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
<s> Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
<s> Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
<s> She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Call her, tell her the combination.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Then what are you doing here?
<s> Stop!!!!
<s> What do you want from me?
<s> It's hard to explain.
<s> I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
<s> I'm hanging up.
<s> It was the window.
<s> Don't go?  I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe.  Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
<s> Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
<s> She talk about the boys?
<s> What?
<s> Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
<s> Save me!
<s> Where to?
<s> Thanks.
<s> Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
<s> That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> When was the last time I said a word?
<s> Where's Della? Bring her here?
<s> Show me Della!
<s> That's your decision.
<s> What kind of man are you?
<s> What?
<s> I don't believe this.
<s> Let go!
<s> I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
<s> Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
<s> I promise.
<s> Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
<s> You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
<s> Don't be funny.
<s> You know who I am.
<s> Like it was yesterday.
<s> Just relax.
<s> I don't know what to say.
<s> They're awfully heavy.
<s> That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
<s> Total delirium.
<s> That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
<s> Help me!
<s> What's wrong?
<s> You in trouble?
<s> Who is?
<s> God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
<s> She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
<s> They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something.
<s> Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
<s> Pour it in.
<s> Punk?
<s> No.
<s> Delongpre! Out of time!
<s> He came for me, I had to run!
<s> And you said high school was boring.
<s> Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
<s> I'm coming, I'm coming.
<s> Let's move out!
<s> Thorgan, suit up.
<s> Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
<s> Faster! Don't we have another gun?
<s> Suit up.
<s> Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
<s> wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
<s> What?
<s> Oh man, what the hell happened?
<s> Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
<s> Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
<s> Guys!!! The shuttle?
<s> Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
<s> Oh sure, all the time.
<s> Okay, good tip.
<s> I think so, why?
<s> Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
<s> Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
<s> They'll make it.
<s> Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
<s> I get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but I get a kick out of you.
<s> Oh my God! Adrienne?
<s> Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
<s> Are there any other shuttles?
<s> You killed him?
<s> Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
<s> I love you.
<s> I just know.
<s> We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
<s> Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?
<s> Obviously so.
<s> You wanna die?
<s> Scientists. Very intellegent men.
<s> I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
<s> C'mon. Middle appendix --
<s> Tattoo. Had it taken off.
<s> Where...?
<s> Have to pump her steady, s'all.
<s> Do you see the kids?
<s> I didn't agree to that!
<s> What kind of a shark did you say it was?
<s> Why?
<s> You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
<s> Who are you?
<s> No, it was local jurisdiction.
<s> Let's all have a drink.
<s> Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct.  I know sharks.
<s> You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
<s> Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
<s> Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
<s> I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
<s> Set?
<s> Is anyone having this...?
<s> You're leaving?
<s> This is Quint, Missus.
<s> Transplants?
<s> I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
<s> Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
<s> He's under!
<s> Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
<s> You've mentioned it about fifty times.
<s> I don't know...
<s> Or something.
<s> I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
<s> Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
<s> Um, hi?
<s> What?
<s> Oh my God, SHUT UP!
<s> Huh?
<s> Also, I think I'm in love with you.
<s> No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
<s> Oh, hey Vijay.
<s> Yup.
<s> I don't really know anything about it.
<s> I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
<s> No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
<s> Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.
<s> I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
<s> It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
<s> It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
<s> Geeeerta Rauuuss!
<s> Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
<s> '93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
<s> Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
<s> Hey, I like this.
<s> Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
<s> Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
<s> Is Vanessa here?
<s> Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
<s> Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
<s> You've never been to a dance, have you?
<s> Really? Fingernails?
<s> You found us in the Penny Saver?
<s> So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
<s> This is the baby. Your baby.
<s> Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
<s> Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
<s> I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
<s> Your name, please?
<s> No thank you. I'm off sex.
<s> Congrats.
<s> You're pregnant?
<s> I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
<s> No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
<s> Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
<s> I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.
<s> I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
<s> I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
<s> I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
<s> I'm staying pregnant, Le.
<s> Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
<s> Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
<s> Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
<s> Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
<s> Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
<s> Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
<s> Adele for god sake please lis...
<s> ...I said, I like your hair.
<s> ...Yeah.
<s> How'd you meet Early?
<s> Jeez... Adele!
<s> ...That's not true.
<s> That's not true!
<s> Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
<s> As many times as it takes.
<s> Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
<s> Vernon, Florida.
<s> What do you need a Bible for?
<s> The party?
<s> It was definitely the high point of the evening.
<s> Funny, very funny.
<s> You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
<s> I don't want to talk about it.
<s> How do you know that?
<s> A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
<s> Why, what did he do?
<s> No.
<s> Everybody just shut up!
<s> Who are you?
<s> Without his car?
<s> With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
<s> Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
<s> Right.
<s> You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
<s> What for? That guys a dick.
<s> Den less go Joe.
<s> The cartoon?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Right.
<s> Darcy?
<s> Why I give pennies?
<s> I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
<s> Good luck?
<s> Yeah.
<s> You are?
<s> Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
<s> Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
<s> Na.
<s> Right now?
<s> Hold on.
<s> Is it cold?
<s> Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
<s> Yeah. I can understand that.
<s> I like you too.
<s> I don't want you to hurt me.
<s> Fine Fidget. What's all this?
<s> But I only had sex with Telly.
<s> Everything is wrong.
<s> Hell yeah, they don't know.
<s> Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
<s> Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
<s> You've heard the stories right?
<s> Oh god. That's horrible.
<s> Holy shit. That's all true?
<s> Yep.
<s> It's grandmother style.
<s> Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
<s> What kind of problem?
<s> Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
<s> I wouldn't know.
<s> Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
<s> I was at the beach.
<s> I'm positive.
<s> Get off me!
<s> What?
<s> You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.
<s> Anything?
<s> Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
<s> Find him!  I want to talk to him.
<s> Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective.  You can't possibly be unbiased.
<s> Did you know her?
<s> If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
<s> Not really.
<s> You like to brag, don't you?
<s> No!  Wait!!
<s> They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
<s> The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
<s> --the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
<s> Fuck off!
<s> I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
<s> He already did once.
<s> That has nothing to do with it.
<s> Okay.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Not that I can see.  We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.
<s> No prints.
<s> Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
<s> I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
<s> I got it from the tournament directory.
<s> Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
<s> How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
<s> But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
<s> I understand that this is just another one of your games.
<s> I signed the confession.  What about the car?
<s> Mate in five.
<s> Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
<s> Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
<s> I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
<s> I can't right now.  I've got a game.
<s> She could be dead now.
<s> Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?
<s> Another kind of game?
<s> You're not?
<s> How could you?  Unless you were there.
<s> No.  But I'm open to distractions.
<s> What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
<s> You've got to face the things you feel.
<s> Call room service.
<s> How could you think that, Kathy?  How could you even consider it?
<s> You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
<s> Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
<s> All directions are the same here.
<s> Yes.
<s> I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.
<s> I have no extraordinary powers.
<s> Reach out farther. Call to her.
<s> Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
<s> What do you see?
<s> There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
<s> What will happen?
<s> You have done it?
<s> Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
<s> I cannot take comfort when she has none.
<s> Perhaps he expected to eat it.
<s> <u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
<s> You and I will guard the fire.
<s> That I promise you.
<s> Would you settle for a boar?
<s> I'd wish for a puppy.
<s> First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
<s> Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
<s> I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
<s> You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
<s> Then look!
<s> Then he will die!
<s> That I am, my lady.
<s> No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.
<s> Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
<s> Yes.
<s> No?
<s> Well, I don't need them...
<s> Huh... 500 meters?
<s> What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
<s> OK.
<s> Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
<s> Mathilda?!
<s> There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
<s> Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
<s> Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
<s> It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
<s> Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
<s> Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
<s> I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
<s> ...Even his mother wouldn't.
<s> May we have this wolf's name and address?
<s> Where?
<s> I'll make it.
<s> What?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
<s> I'll kill you!
<s> Can it kill me?
<s> It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
<s> What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
<s> Yes.
<s> Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
<s> You like to take walks?
<s> You can change.
<s> Go to sleep Ellen.
<s> Good.
<s> If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
<s> I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
<s> And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
<s> If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
<s> Is that right?
<s> That's me.
<s> By car right?
<s> Pulitzer, here I come.
<s> Why know?
<s> Saluting.
<s> I do.
<s> Don't do this.
<s> It's mine to risk.
<s> Someone should be with you.
<s> Oh, that's not mine.
<s> What?  Who are you?
<s> ...Noooo.
<s> Water?
<s> Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
<s> Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
<s> You do?
<s> I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
<s> OK.
<s> I know that...
<s> Whatever that means. Open your presents.
<s> Oh, and what did you do?
<s> I have a 4.0.
<s> I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
<s> I can't tell you.
<s> That's not what's important.
<s> I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
<s> I know! You helped me go from a six to a four!
<s> I guess.
<s> She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
<s> Who's askin'?
<s> Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
<s> I'm a man who knows what I want.
<s> No, she was crying her eyes out.
<s> Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
<s> Forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you.
<s> Definitely! I love him!
<s> Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
<s> No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
<s> What's the point?  Look at me.
<s> Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
<s> Yes, you are.
<s> Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
<s> Thank you. I love you, too.
<s> So?
<s> Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --
<s> Neat.
<s> Thanks again for your help!
<s> I wasn't gonna --
<s> But maybe it is --
<s> Maybe not to your face...
<s> You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
<s> Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
<s> Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
<s> Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
<s> I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
<s> What happened?
<s> I got bangs!
<s> You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
<s> She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing!
<s> Maybe she found him like that.
<s> Of course, I do!
<s> So are you!
<s> But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
<s> That's why I think it's time for us to --
<s> You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
<s> Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --
<s> Harvard. Law school.
<s> Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
<s> I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
<s> Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
<s> Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
<s> How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?
<s> Chuck.
<s> I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it.
<s> Purely a precaution...
<s> Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
<s> I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
<s> Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
<s> Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
<s> What!
<s> It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
<s> Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
<s> How is it this hag knows the truth?
<s> You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
<s> No false modesty, lad.  You're a proper champion.  Achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit.
<s> Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.
<s> A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail.
<s> Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
<s> Blackheart?
<s> Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
<s> Stoutly spoke, lad.  These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.
<s> There's the way, mates.
<s> Willful creature, that one...
<s> Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
<s> No... but what choice have we?
<s> And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
<s> The wound is mortal.
<s> I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
<s> I've not heard a note out of you.
<s> Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
<s> They've fired the moat!
<s> Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
<s> They'll do nicely.
<s> All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
<s> I'm not its master.
<s> Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
<s> My own father...
<s> Oh, la...
<s> Thought the weather terrible of late.
<s> His feet shall never cross my lips.
<s> I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
<s> A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
<s> You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
<s> As fair as me?
<s> Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
<s> Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
<s> Do I not please you, Jack?
<s> What shape I take matters not.  Long you for another?  I'll give you your heart's desire.
<s> Up ahead!
<s> It's done... we'll never catch him.
<s> Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
<s> To Castle Couer de Noir?
<s> You follow.
<s> Don't speak to me of dreams!  I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> I wanna be with you today.
<s> He's here.  Check the bathroom.
<s> What color?
<s> Here, honey!
<s> He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
<s> I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
<s> I want you to try something with me, okay?
<s> Let's shut up and not kill her.
<s> Your dad's really gonna build his house?
<s> He jumped into the ocean.
<s> He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
<s> Okay.  I guess.
<s> Floating to Catalina.
<s> From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
<s> George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
<s> If that's what it takes.
<s> That's too long.
<s> Yes, it is.
<s> There are no windows facing my...exposure.
<s> You have everything?
<s> I'll hate you forever.
<s> No.
<s> No you don't.
<s> I'd blame you.  I want you here.
<s> I might have a solution.
<s> The gloves on the table are for you.
<s> I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
<s> Hi, Mom.
<s> What I'm not.
<s> He's got nothing to do with me.
<s> After everything he did to you and your mom?
<s> That's so weird...
<s> Yes.
<s> You know what mortise and tenon is?
<s> A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
<s> I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
<s> Where is he?
<s> Why does he have a lock on his door?
<s> Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today.
<s> You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
<s> Where will you live?
<s> What?
<s> But you hated four out of the five you did.
<s> That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
<s> My stupid back.
<s> I think so.
<s> No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
<s> So could I.
<s> I'm an idiot to have you up there.
<s> Does Alyssa know?
<s> I'm thinking it's too weird now.
<s> I could use the money.
<s> I'm sixteen years old.  I'm underage. How could I possibly threaten you?
<s> The payoff.
<s> You can't go with me because of Sam?
<s> You live a fabulous life, Robin.
<s> Are you wearing eye shadow?
<s> No.
<s> Can you stay for dinner?
<s> I don't know what I'm doing.
<s> I just thought it would be nice.
<s> Dad's home, already?
<s> Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
<s> Not for me, it ain't.
<s> Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
<s> There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
<s> I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too.
<s> Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.
<s> Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
<s> Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
<s> Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
<s> Claude Banks.
<s> Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
<s> You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
<s> Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
<s> Damn straight, it is. I got my own set of keys because I'm supposed to open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m. Monday morning, there's gonna be hell to pay.
<s> So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
<s> Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
<s> What'd you say?
<s> Yeah, I want some pie.
<s> Still got that ten dollars?
<s> That jelly you were talking to right here?
<s> My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --
<s> He does it all by himself.
<s> The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
<s> Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map.
<s> I don't know. Who do you want?
<s> They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
<s> Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
<s> Him?
<s> Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
<s> I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
<s> They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
<s> That was five years ago.
<s> He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
<s> Go where, Ray?
<s> Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
<s> No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
<s> That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
<s> An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
<s> Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
<s> They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
<s> Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
<s> Made just for you, Cookie.
<s> Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
<s> You heard the boss! Let's move!
<s> That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line...
<s> Hey, Ray...
<s> C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
<s> What were they, bootleggers?
<s> Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
<s> Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
<s> What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
<s> That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
<s> That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
<s> Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
<s> You shouldn't have come here.
<s> No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
<s> Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
<s> Show him Central Park.
<s> I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
<s> My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
<s> She's so nice.
<s> No.
<s> I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
<s> I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
<s> Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
<s> Everything's fine, pop.
<s> You did it for Namath.
<s> Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
<s> How bad?
<s> I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
<s> It's Stanley, sir.
<s> Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
<s> Should we wake him up?
<s> Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
<s> We know where to find Nicky.
<s> Yes, great movie...
<s> I'll just go to Heaven.
<s> Andrew.
<s> That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
<s> That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
<s> Basically, yeah.
<s> Are you dead?
<s> That was Cassius!
<s> I don't know.
<s> Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
<s> You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
<s> Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
<s> Just wondered... what happens?
<s> Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.
<s> Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
<s> I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
<s> ...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
<s> Here.
<s> I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
<s> No.
<s> But I wasn't sure you'd come.
<s> You know.
<s> Maybe you'll think of something...
<s> That's nice.
<s> Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
<s> I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
<s> Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
<s> They won't listen.
<s> Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
<s> The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
<s> "Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
<s> It could be...
<s> Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
<s> Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
<s> Beloved wife...
<s> Yes...
<s> It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
<s> You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think.
<s> I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
<s> Yeah... Laurent.
<s> There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
<s> Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
<s> Me, too.
<s> No, honey... It was part of the deal.
<s> Pete... Don't...
<s> No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
<s> If you want me to go away, I'll go away.
<s> Okay.
<s> Why are ya goin' so early?
<s> What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
<s> Yes.
<s> Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
<s> But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
<s> The wife killer?
<s> No, sir, it's not.
<s> Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
<s> What about yesterday?
<s> Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
<s> But my head...
<s> Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
<s> I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
<s> That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
<s> Yes, I just found it on the step.
<s> I guess so.
<s> I wish I knew.
<s> But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
<s> But...
<s> Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
<s> Okay.
<s> At your house. Don't you remember?
<s> Whatiya mean?
<s> You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
<s> You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
<s> YOU'RE SORRY!!
<s> FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
<s> Oh, read it!
<s> I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Good morning
<s> I'm thinking.
<s> Okay, Lovey.
<s> This doesn't obligate me in any way.
<s> Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
<s> Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
<s> It's unbelievable.
<s> Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!
<s> Over by that hill.
<s> I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
<s> Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
<s> Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
<s> A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
<s> The only one.
<s> Suppose she should leave it?
<s> No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
<s> It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
<s> Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
<s> Why, no.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Are you so certain you are away from it?
<s> Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
<s> Mine?
<s> Do you think this will come in my time?
<s> You?
<s> How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
<s> Yes.
<s> It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
<s> It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
<s> Chang! Chang! Chang!
<s> Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
<s> Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
<s> George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
<s> Yes, the little Russian girl.
<s> Why not?
<s> Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!
<s> Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
<s> Forgiven.  You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
<s> I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
<s> We didn't get much information out of him, did we Bob?
<s> Yes.  Barney!
<s> You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
<s> Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
<s> Cowan--
<s> Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
<s> I guess I lost:
<s> Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
<s> Well this didn't.
<s> Actually, sir--
<s> Kay...
<s> Keep her out of here while I check it out.
<s> She didn't even know you. .
<s> It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
<s> I dunno, man.  Maybe we should.
<s> Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
<s> I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
<s> Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?
<s> Do his job.
<s> You know, there's something we never really thought of...
<s> With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
<s> What is it?
<s> Actually... I don't know.
<s> You figured what?
<s> You're not taking me in!
<s> Come on now.  People are smart.
<s> Actually, yeah--
<s> What if I don't?
<s> This guy.  Where was he?
<s> May I have a look?
<s> The what?
<s> So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
<s> Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
<s> They went right to the President.
<s> And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
<s> Why?
<s> I know... I do, too...
<s> How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
<s> How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
<s> The nano... what?
<s> Yes, sir.  I'm Gideon.  The music relaxes the prisoners.
<s> I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
<s> Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> What?
<s> I go running down there.
<s> John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
<s> No doubt.
<s> I show a cop on horseback.
<s> Everybody runs.
<s> Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
<s> Yeah?  So?
<s> Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
<s> Yes, it is.
<s> Yes.
<s> Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
<s> Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
<s> What does he think of your chosen line of work?
<s> I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
<s> You gonna tell on me?
<s> Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
<s> To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
<s> Do I know you?  Who are you?
<s> Oh... Hi, John.
<s> I need help with her.
<s> No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
<s> They don't belong to anybody.
<s> What a big boy.  How old are you?
<s> All right, I'll try...
<s> I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
<s> Hold your breath, Dad...
<s> Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
<s> Some -- somebody's father?
<s> I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
<s> I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
<s> Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
<s> Kill me!
<s> The what?
<s> I'm... not... a... killer.
<s> You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
<s> Hold that thought.
<s> If... you have one.
<s> Lara, I don't know why this is happening.  I just know they're setting me up.  I can't trust anybody.  I don't know who to talk to or where to go...  Lara?  Are you there?
<s> No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
<s> Lamar --
<s> My God...
<s> I don't want John Anderton hurt.
<s> I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
<s> We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
<s> No, I wanna kill my boss!
<s> Yes, I know.
<s> No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
<s> He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
<s> I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
<s> How many?
<s> I think you're swell company, Knott.
<s> How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.
<s> I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
<s> Yes.
<s> We used to, every summer.
<s> Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
<s> Have you been there recently?
<s> You mean after he lost your son.
<s> What's 'incidentals?'
<s> We're in Fashion.
<s> He's okay.
<s> We used to take baths together.
<s> No more.
<s> Show uncle Ricky what you made.
<s> He's not doing it.
<s> You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
<s> Chloe?
<s> I love you. Come home.
<s> I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
<s> Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
<s> They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
<s> I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
<s> Yeah? You sure?
<s> Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
<s> Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
<s> Get away from her.
<s> Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
<s> We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
<s> What do you mean 'troughed?'
<s> Quick drop. In and out.
<s> Me? No. Not really.
<s> What?
<s> So, that's it. I'm out?
<s> We get it. We're sorry.
<s> I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
<s> You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?
<s> Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
<s> I'll page you.
<s> Yeah. I know the number.
<s> I got no idea.
<s> I will.
<s> We don't need guns.
<s> No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
<s> It's not even yours.
<s> See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
<s> I promised Chloe we'd come here.
<s> To keep?
<s> Pretty nice.
<s> Nah, don't bother --
<s> Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
<s> But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
<s> As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
<s> What the fuck do you...
<s> Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
<s> I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
<s> I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
<s> We don't need guns.
<s> No more, man.
<s> How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
<s> I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
<s> Tom. How's it going?
<s> He's on the list.
<s> S'up.
<s> Drinks are free, right?
<s> I hear the China Club is a laugh.
<s> How's it going?
<s> No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
<s> Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
<s> Different.
<s> You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
<s> But, Max --
<s> Outfit? What's he talking about?
<s> Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
<s> Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
<s> Who's up for a night on the town.
<s> I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
<s> I'll take your goddam bet.
<s> There's two guns on you.
<s> That's a fact. What you do, boy?
<s> I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
<s> 'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
<s> Elijah who?
<s> Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
<s> The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.
<s> No. That's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you?
<s> For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
<s> If you want to tell me.
<s> I can handle it.
<s> You have enough worries of your own.
<s> What have you set your mind to?
<s> Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
<s> What do you think?
<s> The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
<s> What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
<s> At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
<s> Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
<s> Just what is your question?
<s> Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "Yeah, man, any place is better than this." You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one.
<s> What?
<s> Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
<s> If she got eyes, she do.
<s> Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.
<s> What mission?
<s> Shorty, this is Laura.
<s> Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
<s> Tell him about Baldy.
<s> I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
<s> What can you do?
<s> Brothers of Brother Johnson.
<s> Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
<s> It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
<s> What do you want?
<s> Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
<s> [It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]
<s> I have connections.
<s> He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
<s> He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
<s> Where?
<s> [Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.]
<s> [Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.]
<s> [Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
<s> [So am I, Sister.]
<s> [Do you know who I am?]
<s> [I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
<s> I don't know, but I know his face.
<s> [In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
<s> [Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
<s> [I told you, non-negotiable.]
<s> Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
<s> Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
<s> A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
<s> Sorry I woke you, Ray.
<s> I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.
<s> If they like me.
<s> Who's Emilio?
<s> Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
<s> No.
<s> I'm not crying.
<s> Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
<s> It's better to be free, right?
<s> No.
<s> There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
<s> That's not a question.
<s> You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
<s> There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
<s> You got that right.
<s> No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.
<s> Planned what?
<s> I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
<s> Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
<s> I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
<s> She understands men.
<s> [No. Why?]
<s> Don't forget your towel.
<s> And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
<s> Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
<s> He has to go.
<s> [It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
<s> [He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]
<s> So am I.
<s> That's what friends do.
<s> This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
<s> I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
<s> She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
<s> All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
<s> I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
<s> I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
<s> I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
<s> He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
<s> I came to see you. How you feel?
<s> I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
<s> Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
<s> It's her baby too, you know.
<s> You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
<s> Were the lights on?
<s> Yes, I know.
<s> Yes, I know.
<s> It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
<s> I just wanna kiss, that's all.
<s> Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
<s> Sure, great if you ain't married.
<s> I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
<s> Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight to your house, and I talk with Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right.
<s> Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
<s> She didn't look Italian to me.
<s> What didn't you like about her?
<s> Hiya, Ralph...
<s> No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
<s> That's swell, Missus Fusari.
<s> Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
<s> We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa.
<s> I don't wanna talk about it!
<s> Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
<s> Waddaya talking about?!!
<s> I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
<s> I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
<s> Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
<s> Just use common sense. Your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best Cross Action.
<s> Home.
<s> He said it for us all, Walt.
<s> Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
<s> What the hell's going on here?
<s> Duke Forrest.
<s> I done my shopping in Seoul last night.
<s> Same here. You can retire my number.
<s> People will talk.
<s> We're a good team.
<s> It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
<s> You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
<s> At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
<s> Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
<s> Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
<s> I like an olive.
<s> The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
<s> As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.
<s> 'Course it isn't, but how many chances do we get to go to Japan? With our golf clubs.
<s> So let's haul ass, Sergeant.
<s> Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
<s> We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
<s> Oh, Jesus.
<s> I don't get it.
<s> On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
<s> We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
<s> It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
<s> Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.
<s> It's possible
<s> No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
<s> Ayuh.
<s> You're leaving tomorrow?
<s> It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
<s> I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
<s> Why would he do that?
<s> Yeah!
<s> Excuse me, Sergeant.
<s> What do you want with those two medical officers?
<s> I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
<s> Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
<s> Nope, we're assigned heah.
<s> But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
<s> Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.
<s> It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
<s> Yes, sir?
<s> Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?
<s> Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
<s> They can't do that to me!
<s> May I have the surgeon's name, please?
<s> Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
<s> No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
<s> But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
<s> Yeah. Lavender and old lace!
<s> Are you all right?
<s> With all of it?
<s> Who?
<s> John Doe Clubs? What for?
<s> Me?
<s> About me?
<s> Yeah, that's the one.
<s> Yes, I did, John. But II had no idea what was going on.
<s> How do you do.
<s> Mr. D. B. Norton!
<s> Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
<s> Wait a minute . . .
<s> Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
<s> John Doe.
<s> No, no, no! You can't take pictures of him like thateating a sandwichand with a beard!
<s> Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
<s> Friend of his. They play duets together.
<s> If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
<s> Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
<s> Oh, let me go, will you!
<s> Where is she?
<s> Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.  Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
<s> Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
<s> Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for
<s> No, I didn't.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
<s> No, sir.
<s> You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
<s> I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
<s> They want Walter dead!
<s> Is there a problem?
<s> I what?
<s> Wait a minute, lemme see that.
<s> ...a car.
<s> Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
<s> Roper...
<s> Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
<s> Is that all?
<s> What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
<s> Sorry... Habit.
<s> Only at the very end.
<s> Like it had to be done.
<s> Not the ones I'm at.
<s> Every couple of months, huh?
<s> Do you really?
<s> Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
<s> It's against my nature.
<s> Thou shall have no other God before me.
<s> You're a compulsive gambler?
<s> I have two words for you... Seek help.
<s> I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
<s> The jockey!
<s> Damnit!
<s> I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
<s> I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
<s> Good question.
<s> Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
<s> Greg.
<s> About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.
<s> Mmm, needs a little something.
<s> Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
<s> It's very nice.
<s> Use your imagination.
<s> I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
<s> You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
<s> He says, "Thank you very much."  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.
<s> Depends. What's up?
<s> Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
<s> I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
<s> -- No.
<s> New York.
<s> But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
<s> -- He won't.
<s> The truth.
<s> Katie was digitized.
<s> Insurance.
<s> Tanner.
<s> Once they digitized you, they added it.
<s> Yes.
<s> Way you kiss me.

<s> Everybody hold on tight.  We're gonna send this sucker into OBLIVION!
<s> Don't lose hope yet, Alpha!
<s> NINJA WOLF ZORD!
<s> Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
<s> A stellar idea, Skull.
<s> BULK!!
<s> Did I say anything?
<s> You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--
<s> How'd you know?
<s> What's going on?!
<s> And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky!
<s> LET'S DO IT!?
<s> You've got the public upset, Al.
<s> Awwh, Charlie.
<s> Since Colosimo bit it, I gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
<s> Charlie Luciano.
<s> I cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
<s> Can't we get a couple whores over?
<s> From your mouth ta God's ear.
<s> When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
<s> Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
<s> No. I'm here with you.
<s> London?
<s> It'll all be over tomorrow. No more wars. No more killin'. Just livin' normal like everybody else.  You'll be stuck with me for good.
<s> As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
<s> We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me.
<s> So what is the problem?
<s> Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
<s> Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
<s> I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
<s> He's trying to make it.
<s> Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
<s> Didn't know you felt that way.
<s> The name's Charlie.
<s> I've got friends.
<s> He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.
<s> What about the share.
<s> And the Jews?
<s> The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
<s> I turned him down flat.
<s> Jesus.
<s> Fuck 'em.
<s> We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
<s> Stu. That was right about the time we met.
<s> I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
<s> Most we've ever used is half a CC.
<s> <u>Why</u>??
<s> I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
<s> Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
<s> But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
<s> I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.
<s> I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
<s> Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
<s> Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
<s> Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
<s> Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
<s> Maybe you could talk to Death!
<s> You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
<s> Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.
<s> Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
<s> <u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
<s> They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
<s> Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
<s> The ring...
<s> Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
<s> I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
<s> <u>What</u> union?
<s> Well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. It was different then. I was <u>depressed</u>. My life is great now. I'm in love!
<s> Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do.
<s> Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
<s> Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything.
<s> Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
<s> Uh-huh?
<s> I don't want to talk about it.
<s> That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
<s> Oh, I hope so, dear.
<s> Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
<s> Mm hmm.
<s> Oh.  Well, that would be a ... change.  Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a very reassuring voice.
<s> ... Oh ...
<s> Yeah.
<s> Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
<s> Never.
<s> I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
<s> I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine-- call Saunders--
<s> No!
<s> Who?
<s> Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--
<s> Good idea. When?
<s> Tonight?
<s> No--not offhand--
<s> Huh?
<s> Why me?
<s> What is it?
<s> Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
<s> Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--
<s> I *won't* send Horace Miller!
<s> I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
<s> Me! Jim--how--?
<s> Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
<s> Aw--
<s> Is *what* getting me down?
<s> Well, Jeff put that out himself.
<s> Emma!
<s> Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
<s> Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--
<s> Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
<s> Oh, I couldn't tonight. Thanks a lot.
<s> His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
<s> Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
<s> The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?
<s> Satan's in this little fella tonight!
<s> How's Amos, Ma?
<s> Like what, Mr. Taylor?
<s> What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
<s> Most natural thing in the world!
<s> I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
<s> Convene?
<s> No. What had you better--?
<s> I know--but you--you're going to help.
<s> How?
<s> Why?
<s> What's that?
<s> But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
<s> City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
<s> Since sixteen or so.
<s> No! Stop it!
<s> Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
<s> Do you want to dictate them?
<s> Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
<s> If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
<s> Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
<s> I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--
<s> You were about to recognize me, sir--
<s> Ring the call to quorum.
<s> How'd you like a punch in the nose?
<s> That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
<s> Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
<s> It's crucifying him--!
<s> Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
<s> What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
<s> Senator Paine.
<s> It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
<s> Order!
<s> Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!
<s> Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
<s> Page boys!
<s> Who's that?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> He sure is.
<s> No!
<s> What did they say?
<s> Oh, that
<s> Sure!
<s> No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
<s> I don't blame you.
<s> Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
<s> Hello.
<s> What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
<s> I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
<s> Oh, as bad as that, huh?
<s> Shhh!
<s> They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
<s> Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
<s> Oh, yes sir.
<s> A smaller bowl of flowers.
<s> Perfect! Perfect!
<s> Let me go!
<s> They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
<s> They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
<s> You can't?
<s> Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N
<s> All set.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> No, thank you.
<s> No, thanks.
<s> Why should you?
<s> Oh.
<s> Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
<s> What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
<s> You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
<s> Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
<s> Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
<s> If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it.
<s> No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds.  You know, we've got letters.
<s> Take the stand!
<s> Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I
<s> An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil.  I was watching you.
<s> Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
<s> Thank you, Your Honor.
<s> I'm a writer myself, you know.
<s> You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
<s> South Dakota north.
<s> South Dakota - but on the top.
<s> Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
<s> What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
<s> Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
<s> I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
<s> Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
<s> Who?
<s> Me more than most.
<s> Really? You think so?
<s> I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
<s> One hundred books?
<s> Doubtful. What did he say?
<s> Mr. Cook.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
<s> Are we?
<s> Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
<s> Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
<s> Henry!
<s> Nope.
<s> What do you do?
<s> She seems very unhappy.
<s> No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
<s> I'd better get in there.
<s> It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
<s> I think it's like... inquisitive.
<s> Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
<s> You like me. How come?
<s> Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
<s> Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
<s> No, I really don't.
<s> Why don't you tell me?
<s> Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
<s> I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
<s> We'll turn back anytime you want.
<s> Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
<s> Is she against you getting help?
<s> What?
<s> Be specific.
<s> Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
<s> Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
<s> Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
<s> I don't know if --
<s> Okay...
<s> What do you mean, "in no time"?
<s> That's not quite what I said --
<s> If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
<s> Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
<s> Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?
<s> Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
<s> Yep.
<s> -- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
<s> Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
<s> Just you.
<s> Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
<s> Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert...
<s> All new people start with that...
<s> I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do.  Mainly, I listen.
<s> Really?
<s> Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?
<s> Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
<s> They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
<s> Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
<s> When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
<s> Perhaps.
<s> To have stopped this creature? Yes!
<s> It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
<s> -- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
<s> Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
<s> I just decked your brother
<s> Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
<s> Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
<s> Because that's my name.
<s> It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
<s> Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
<s> Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
<s> Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
<s> Be nice. That thing saved my life.
<s> We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
<s> He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
<s> Of course.
<s> I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
<s> Really?
<s> Do it, big boy!
<s> Or even what it looks like.
<s> I thought you'd never ask.
<s> It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.
<s> Should I kill them?
<s> And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
<s> They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
<s> I thought you'd chickened out on me.
<s> Me, too.
<s> Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
<s> There's a vague similarity.
<s> I can't.
<s> So you're chicken?
<s> See ya tomorrow.
<s> But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
<s> The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
<s> Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?
<s> Yes.
<s> We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
<s> Oh hi, Mom.
<s> Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
<s> And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
<s> Definitely.
<s> Sorry.
<s> Whatever our name is.
<s> Through there!
<s> General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
<s> Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
<s> For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
<s> I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
<s> Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
<s> What do you have in mind?
<s> What forces do you have at your disposal?
<s> Our lives, the revolution, my career?
<s> Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
<s> I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
<s> Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Yes, I am.
<s> That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
<s> Four o'clock.
<s> Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
<s> Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
<s> But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
<s> My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
<s> Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
<s> One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
<s> Oh, I'm sorry about that.
<s> Lisette.
<s> Well, you shall see.
<s> I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
<s> My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
<s> Only as a last resort.  What are the Councils doing now?
<s> Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
<s> Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
<s> I don't understand you.
<s> All right -- I promise.
<s> Where is Madame Trillaud?
<s> What are you doing in there?
<s> Will you be joining us, soon?
<s> Five minutes.
<s> It's me.
<s> Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
<s> Why not?
<s> I couldn't face telling you.
<s> My God, what do you think?
<s> Yes?
<s> You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
<s> You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
<s> I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
<s> I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
<s> Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
<s> No.
<s> With his army of 400,000 men in concealed bivouacs, on a ten mile front, in the forests, bordering the banks of the Vistula river, Napoleon conducted a last minute personal reconnaissance, disguised in the uniform of a Polish lancer.
<s> Naw, it ain't like that.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
<s> Thank you.  I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.
<s> I don't know... I think he went out the back.
<s> It's something in that hydraulic pump.
<s> Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
<s> You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
<s> That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
<s> I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
<s> I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
<s> Ain't no windows in here.
<s> That ain't gonna work.
<s> That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
<s> So what?  Let's make'em wait.
<s> Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go.  Wife stays here, of course.
<s> All damn.
<s> It's alright.
<s> I'll remember.
<s> Yeah, pops!
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Let it go, Roach, trust me.
<s> Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday.
<s> Call me.
<s> I don't know the number.
<s> Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones.  Drop everything, Craig is in trouble.  Come quick.  Don't try to call.
<s> Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
<s> Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.
<s> Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
<s> You sent my assistant on an errand.
<s> The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is?
<s> Of course.  I wish everything were that easy.
<s> I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
<s> At one thirty my little girl is dead.
<s> The gun...
<s> It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
<s> Tell me why I miss him.
<s> Tell me why he's dead.
<s> No, please...
<s> I think you're right.
<s> No way.
<s> Nods.
<s> Oh, man...
<s> That's right.
<s> In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
<s> No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
<s> I see. Where is this gun?
<s> Help me get her off the rug.
<s> You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
<s> He carried on some; kicked.
<s> No.
<s> He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
<s> Keep talkin', Preacher.
<s> Dad, you're bleeding...
<s> Yes, Dad.
<s> I will guard Pearl with my life...
<s> Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
<s> Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
<s> If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
<s> You have all sinned!
<s> Walt!
<s> May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
<s> A man of the Cloth?
<s> String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
<s> It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
<s> It's a shame!
<s> What!
<s> I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
<s> Sshhh...
<s> Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
<s> Why?
<s> John, where are we g --
<s> I mind you said there was two.
<s> I'll make coffee.
<s> Is that all?
<s> You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
<s> Yes. Yes.
<s> I'll tell.
<s> In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
<s> Don't you believe me?
<s> That's no secret. I'm five.
<s> Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
<s> Can I have this?
<s> No. No one never did.
<s> She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
<s> How'do.
<s> Where's she at?
<s> The Drugstore?
<s> Pearl and John.
<s> No, nothing.
<s> Since the murder. She was fine before that.
<s> Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
<s> Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
<s> Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
<s> Okay, okay.  I think.
<s> You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
<s> What?
<s> Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
<s> I'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. What you got?
<s> Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
<s> Krueger.
<s> School.
<s> I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
<s> I will.
<s> But that's just not reality, Nancy!
<s> Put that damned thing down!
<s> The door was locked from your side.
<s> I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
<s> No.
<s> I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of... obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...
<s> Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
<s> Jungle man fix Jane.
<s> No more fights.
<s> An omelet.
<s> About what?
<s> I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
<s> They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
<s> Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
<s> I don't want to go to Siberia.
<s> How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka.
<s> That's another thing... it's spring.
<s> I know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination.  In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!
<s> But what can we do?... We have to accept.
<s> Yes, he looks like a comrade!
<s> For ourselves... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters.
<s> And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
<s> No, that's bad management.
<s> You didn't get legal advice?
<s> Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
<s> The Duchess...
<s> Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
<s> Oh, yes, yes.
<s> You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
<s> If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Certainly.
<s> Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
<s> These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State.
<s> How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
<s> We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
<s> But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
<s> Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
<s> Comrade.
<s> Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
<s> Yes. It is unfortunate.
<s> Au revoir.
<s> What business?
<s> You're going to force us... huh?
<s> Why should I take a chance?
<s> Or a tunnel or a bridge...
<s> And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
<s> What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La Bohme... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction!  It will cost me a franc but it is worth it.  The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look....  What do you see?
<s> I will do my best.
<s> He takes good care of that.
<s> We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
<s> Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
<s> You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
<s> Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
<s> Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.
<s> I don't like your following me.
<s> Why?
<s> Yes.
<s> Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, "Just a moment, you charming little dress, I want you to meet Ninotchka... you two were meant for each other." Ninotchka feels more comfortable.
<s> I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
<s> Ninotchka, I love you.
<s> Ninotchka, you're jealous.
<s> There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!
<s> And General Savitzky.
<s> Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
<s> You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
<s> Darling, darling... please!
<s> Comrades! Good people of France!
<s> No speech?
<s> Yes... a kiss... salute!
<s> I know... it's the Russian soul.
<s> Let's turn on the radio.
<s> Who cried that one?
<s> Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, "Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!"
<s> Please.
<s> If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
<s> We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
<s> Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
<s> Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
<s> Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
<s> It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
<s> No.
<s> I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
<s> Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
<s> Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
<s> It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
<s> No... please...
<s> I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
<s> I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
<s> If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
<s> We have nothing to discuss.
<s> Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
<s> I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
<s> Go on.
<s> That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
<s> Why?
<s> May I ask what has happened?
<s> Yes... leaving immediately.
<s> Where is it?
<s> My jewels?!
<s> Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
<s> They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants.
<s> You did say it, sir.
<s> No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
<s> Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here.
<s> I'll bet he would.
<s> Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time.
<s> Mitchell?
<s> I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
<s> No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.
<s> It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...
<s> ... go on.
<s> You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
<s> Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
<s> A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
<s> Cox!  Fire him.
<s> The hell he will!  Fire him, too.  If you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the Justice Department, fire the sonofabitch!  And ...
<s> It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it.
<s> Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.
<s> Yes, you approved it, sir.
<s> It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.
<s> Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
<s> "National Priority."
<s> All right.
<s> The bastard!  If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won.  He made me look soft.
<s> Dick, you don't have to make a statement.  Herb covered it for you.
<s> Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...
<s> They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
<s> My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?
<s> He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
<s> It's Helms -- it's got to be.
<s> Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
<s> No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
<s> What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
<s> Harold ... can I get you anything?
<s> I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure.
<s> The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
<s> He's lying, Clyde.  Always has. That's why Nixon's always been useful. Hold still.  And take your hand off your hip.
<s> It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
<s> Winning?
<s> I always get my man.
<s> Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
<s> "A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
<s> Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
<s> She's quite pretty.
<s> He's all business, ain't he, Trini?  Dick, we could've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal.  We brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ...
<s> Agreed.
<s> What do you mean, Jack?
<s> The American people put me where I am.
<s> He was, he was.  We taught a class together at Harvard.  But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...
<s> He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children.  He sees a shrink in L.A.  He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead.  He must be stopped at all costs.
<s> I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
<s> Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
<s> You remember, John, in '48 -- no one believed Alger Hiss was a communist. Except me.  They loved Hiss just like they loved this Ellsberg character. East Coast, Ivy League.  He was their kind.  I was dirt to them.  Nothing.
<s> You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
<s> One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
<s> But change always comes slowly.  I've withdrawn more than half the troops. I'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years.  I want an all-volunteer army.  But it's also a question of American credibility, our position in the world ...
<s> Elvis I like, too.
<s> And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
<s> What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
<s> Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
<s> You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...  But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of a lot.
<s> Not that.  Us.
<s> The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
<s> He doesn't want me at the funeral.
<s> Yes, it's been a long time ...
<s> No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
<s> Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
<s> Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
<s> Who else'd be in your truck.
<s> I deduced it. Once you walked in.
<s> Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
<s> You don't know what he thinks.
<s> Try "old" on for size.
<s> You ain't heard from him?
<s> These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
<s> I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
<s> That's very linear Sheriff.
<s> Sir, I don't want to picture that.
<s> There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
<s> My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I  don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know...
<s> Yes Sheriff.
<s> I never do.
<s> I can't plan your day.
<s> Lord no. I'm not retired.
<s> To your husband.
<s> Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
<s> Yes. Things fall into place.
<s> At the gettin' place.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Why would we go to Odessa?
<s> Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
<s> Why would I let you do that?
<s> It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.
<s> I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
<s> Screwgie.
<s> Huh? Airport or airstrip?
<s> Well -- where ya goin'?
<s> Yeah? Where am I?
<s> You know she won't be there.
<s> I see.
<s> Y'all getting any rain up your way?
<s> Well...
<s> You stand to win everything. Call it.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
<s> I do like you.
<s> To kill your wife.
<s> He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
<s> She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
<s> Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
<s> I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
<s> She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
<s> Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
<s> You think a woman did that?!
<s> You said a woman couldn't have done it.
<s> You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
<s> No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
<s> I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
<s> That's a nice name for what you need...
<s> YOU shut up!  They're beautiful, but get them some water.
<s> They're fine... you miss it?
<s> Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
<s> I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
<s> I don't think I am.
<s> Umm... yes. Back home.
<s> You sure? Maybe next week we could...
<s> He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
<s> Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
<s> There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
<s> What happened when you were twelve?
<s> What do you mean? What did I do to you...
<s> David, please --
<s> Roy! What are you doing here?
<s> Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
<s> ...did I win some contest?
<s> The one you were telling me about?
<s> Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
<s> Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
<s> How many men have I talked to?
<s> This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
<s> Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
<s> How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
<s> Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
<s> Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
<s> Are we gonna do business here, or not?
<s> I... I don't know...
<s> ...and put them in your mouth.
<s> Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
<s> I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
<s> You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
<s> You're always so coarse... "Do her right here." Let's just see what happens, okay?  "I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin' 'Mother', I love you!' P.S. I wish I could say this to my mother's face, but I can't anymore."
<s> Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
<s> No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
<s> ...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
<s> It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
<s> What's wrong with you?
<s> Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
<s> Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...
<s> You better believe it.
<s> "Injuns?"
<s> No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
<s> I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
<s> Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
<s> You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
<s> David Ravell.
<s> I swear to God!
<s> That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
<s> Good Lord, what do we do?
<s> I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
<s> That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
<s> Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.
<s> What're you gonna do with your share of the treasure, Pete?
<s> Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!
<s> I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
<s> He was never turned into a frog!
<s> Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
<s> Okay, Pappy.
<s> Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
<s> Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
<s> Not out the other side his face, though.
<s> Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
<s> I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
<s> Well sure, honey, but...
<s> For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
<s> No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!
<s> It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
<s> Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
<s> I am. Hur you?
<s> Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
<s> Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, long time, only ten dolla.
<s> Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
<s> Nobody. It just came to me.
<s> From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
<s> Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
<s> I never said any of that!
<s> Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
<s> Yes, Joe.
<s> What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
<s> Pity you don't have the character.
<s> Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
<s> Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
<s> Yes, sir!
<s> I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
<s> Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
<s> How're you doing, Sarge?
<s> Pardon?
<s> No, sir.
<s> Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
<s> Zack, don't!
<s> What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
<s> My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
<s> That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
<s> What?
<s> Well, I'll be goddamned.
<s> Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
<s> I got my foot on the floor.
<s> Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'
<s> No way... Would you?
<s> Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
<s> Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.
<s> Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
<s> Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
<s> He didn't give you much choice.
<s> Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
<s> Be a friend. Leave.
<s> Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
<s> I've never had a girl.
<s> God.
<s> Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
<s> I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
<s> I know that.
<s> Why'd he do it?
<s> I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
<s> Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
<s> He said he grew up poor?
<s> I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
<s> 'Nellie's Nymphos!'
<s> Yeah.
<s> You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
<s> I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
<s> Peace out.
<s> The fuck did you do that for?!
<s> I can't...
<s> Not that one.
<s> Yeah.  Kidnapping.
<s> Pure idiot.
<s> Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?
<s> Do me a favor and don't talk.
<s> Could you slow down a little?  Or we could wait for the car...
<s> The furniture guy?
<s> Open the door.
<s> Got us in here, didn't I?
<s> Don't.
<s> Wait.
<s> Feel okay?
<s> Little bit.  Yeah.
<s> What am I, a five year old?
<s> I don't know, why?
<s> I'm here.  I'm here.
<s> He --
<s> What if I do?
<s> Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
<s> They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings.
<s> I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
<s> You know it brother.
<s> I got you.
<s> Yeah... whatever you say.
<s> Fuck how they operate. Just do it. like your man says, "By any means necessary."
<s> Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
<s> Look this is bull...
<s> Party needs the bread.  Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!
<s> Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
<s> No man. PE -- "political education."
<s> Cy... I ain't even sure.
<s> Naw... I gotta...
<s> That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
<s> Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made...
<s> Jesus...
<s> Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution.
<s> Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
<s> Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
<s> You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'm down.
<s> Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important.
<s> Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
<s> Me too. That's why I fight so hard.
<s> Well, act like it. Come on.
<s> Maybe...
<s> Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
<s> What are you saying?
<s> No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
<s> Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk.
<s> Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
<s> I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
<s> That would be nice.
<s> His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
<s> Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
<s> Lovely.
<s> Very well, proceed, sir.
<s> That one is a bit more difficult.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
<s> Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
<s> He tried.  It didn't take.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I should have killed him when I had the chance?
<s> That's right.
<s> Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
<s> Harry, Harry, Harry...
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
<s> How many men have we seen die?
<s> That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
<s> Four, five miles.
<s> But what about Thomas?
<s> He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
<s> No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
<s> In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.
<s> For a little while.
<s> Yes.
<s> Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
<s> You believe in it.
<s> Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
<s> Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
<s> Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.
<s> Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
<s> Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
<s> Not at all.
<s> Allman Brothers.
<s> Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
<s> What did we do, Jud?
<s> No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
<s> Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
<s> Remember.
<s> Come on--let's parole 'em.
<s> Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
<s> I just said--
<s> Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
<s> You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
<s> See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
<s> Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.
<s> The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
<s> You can go to your grave not knowing.
<s> What're you suggesting?
<s> Men!  Are you up for it?
<s> Or you could surrender.
<s> Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
<s> No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
<s> I want you to leave.  And never come back.
<s> Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
<s> Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
<s> A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
<s> I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
<s> Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
<s> Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?
<s> She can hold a bit longer.
<s> I know.  That was for the smell.
<s> Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
<s> What?  He never told me that.
<s> Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
<s> You threatened Miss Swann.
<s> Somewhat.
<s> Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
<s> So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
<s> My father.  William Turner?
<s> That's not true.
<s> He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
<s> You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
<s> These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --
<s> On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --
<s> ... No.
<s> Speak.
<s> Do you know what I see?  I see man making his own clouds.  I see man coloring his own sky, and like this garden it is a site that makes my heart sing.
<s> Maybe you should, but you can't.
<s> Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
<s> That remains to be seen.
<s> She must feel something for him. After all, she and I did create him.
<s> Okay, arms up, lean forward.
<s> That might work.
<s> Shut up and do it!
<s> So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
<s> What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
<s> Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
<s> I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
<s> Who isn't?
<s> Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God, he's got it!
<s> You're insane.
<s> Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
<s> That was 'simple'?
<s> What happens?
<s> But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
<s> Yeah.  Old times.
<s> No problem.
<s> I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
<s> You don't have to say anything, Daniel.  I'm a scientist.  I know what's happening.  I recognize the classic symptoms.  Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body...
<s> Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
<s> You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
<s> Get him, Daniel!  Knock his block off!
<s> Dexter.
<s> Goodbye, Stew
<s> Certainly. Right over there.
<s> I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
<s> No - give you another guess.
<s> Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
<s> How-di-do.
<s> But we don't need it, I'm sure.
<s> Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
<s> Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
<s> Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters
<s> I see.
<s> Your house?
<s> I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
<s> Oh, man!
<s> But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
<s> Oh boy, I'd love it.
<s> Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.
<s> Well - it's only April.
<s> All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
<s> Do you call yourself a reporter?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
<s> My play.
<s> Dawson, sir.
<s> Oh no, sir!
<s> A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
<s> Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
<s> There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
<s> Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
<s> I didn't run away.
<s> Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
<s> I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
<s> Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
<s> Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
<s> Staring at us?
<s> Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
<s> Never even been to New Madrid.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
<s> I have it here.
<s> No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
<s> You don't.
<s> And now for that twentieth crack
<s> The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
<s> I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready.
<s> All right, Grandma
<s> Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
<s> Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Well, sir, I putter.
<s> A bird in a gilded cage?
<s> Yes.
<s> I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
<s> Looks just like it did.
<s> Thanks ... I love you.
<s> I'm sorry ...
<s> Bud brought it to me.
<s> She's crying.
<s> I've got to go ...
<s> All night?
<s> Um ... It's ...
<s> Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
<s> Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?
<s> ... Lover's Lane.
<s> So.
<s> What's the matter?
<s> I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
<s> Rain.
<s> Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
<s> Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
<s> Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
<s> Very well ...
<s> The basketball team?
<s> Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
<s> Hello Mr. Simpson.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
<s> What's going to happen?
<s> Nothing.
<s> The pages filled in?
<s> That's great.
<s> Right here.
<s> Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
<s> Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
<s> ... Lover's Lane?
<s> What?
<s> Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
<s> I like it too.
<s> Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
<s> Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
<s> Yeah ... Sort of ...
<s> You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
<s> What department store did they go to?
<s> Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
<s> I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
<s> Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
<s> ... Yeah.
<s> Yeah ...
<s> Just listen to me ...
<s> Thanks.  But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
<s> Hi.
<s> You're gonna keep painting aren't you?
<s> Just a little--You know.
<s> That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
<s> Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.
<s> Cool.
<s> Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
<s> And what was this?
<s> That's it.
<s> Ok. Thank you.
<s> D&D Mattress Man.
<s> She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
<s> That's your fault not mine.
<s> Hello everyone.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
<s> Call me later.
<s> ....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
<s> Are you watching a porno movie?
<s> What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you?
<s> You have a girlfriend?
<s> It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
<s> This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
<s> ....what....?
<s> We got disconnected before....
<s> I need help.
<s> This is not cool.
<s> No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
<s> -- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
<s> Ok.
<s> About six months.
<s> Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
<s> No, no. I did.
<s> Yeah?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Lena?
<s> It's Barry.
<s> You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
<s> This is funny.
<s> For what?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Can I come home with you when we get there?
<s> You left me at the hospital.
<s> For what?
<s> Ok, bye, bye.
<s> Just have you for one second, please.
<s> Can I ask how much is this?
<s> -- and this is confidential?
<s> I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
<s> YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
<s> I didn't know you had a sister?
<s> That was weird. I meant good.
<s> And I'm sorry that I did that.
<s> That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
<s> ...it just....I don't know....I don't know.
<s> WHICH?
<s> Wait a minute --
<s> What do you have in the house?
<s> You have another house somewhere or something?
<s> You know, please, I just wanna say that I didn't say I would help her out; I was very clear about it....I don't think that this is fair.....wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch.....
<s> What time are you gonna be there?
<s> Don't puss out.
<s> You don't need to talk all macho, "shake him out, little bad boy." Whatever -- you're not an action hero, tough guy, you're not a gangster --
<s> It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
<s> We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
<s> I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
<s> In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
<s> I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
<s> I'll fill page after page, I promise.
<s> But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
<s> It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" --
<s> But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
<s> Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
<s> Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
<s> How can one man possibly be so selfish?
<s> That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
<s> Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
<s> A man after my own heart...
<s> Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
<s> I'm here.
<s> A few indiscretions in his youth.
<s> His wife's influence.
<s> Shut down?
<s> Oh indeed?
<s> He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
<s> I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
<s> Is it awfully violent?
<s> What's that then?
<s> How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
<s> Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
<s> With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
<s> I am not a wealthy woman.
<s> What thought is that?
<s> Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
<s> Of course.
<s> It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
<s> I wonder sometimes.
<s> Am I?
<s> She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
<s> And he did.
<s> You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
<s> But I am That's the killer, honey.
<s> I'll remember that.
<s> Do you?
<s> How much?
<s> One . . . buys things.
<s> Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
<s> I am not that woman.
<s> No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
<s> Sir, I-
<s> No -- no -- I mean--
<s> Uh-huh
<s> Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
<s> Kid, you just got your ass kicked on Joseph Conrad and now you're gonna go to Schaefer and tell him you wanna do the id and the superego? Stop being so goddamn smart.
<s> I don't wanna write about no spic.
<s> Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.
<s> Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
<s> So speaks the court jester.
<s> I expected more from you.
<s> And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
<s> They don't have to.
<s> Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
<s> Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .
<s> Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
<s> "And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"
<s> So they're Jews. . .
<s> Herman.
<s> Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
<s> We already made the same offer to the stockholders.
<s> Get out
<s> Again
<s> Please don't ask me to do this.
<s> When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray.
<s> It was fun, wasn't it?
<s> Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
<s> Yes!
<s> About what?
<s> Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
<s> And where you goin'?
<s> I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
<s> Jack! Enough!
<s> No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
<s> You wasn't with her, were you?
<s> No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
<s> What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
<s> I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
<s> I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
<s> Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
<s> I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
<s> Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
<s> It's OK.
<s> Come over here.
<s> Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
<s> "Father of the Bride."
<s> What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
<s> No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
<s> I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
<s> Never felt better.
<s> Yeah, the weight's Ok.
<s> He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
<s> Get lost.  Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat."
<s> Excuse me for living.
<s> Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
<s> I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
<s> What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
<s> I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
<s> And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
<s> This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
<s> I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
<s> Namely?
<s> That's what they call a family problem.
<s> Thanks.
<s> I was jaywalking.
<s> Not yet.
<s> Who left -- where?
<s> Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
<s> I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
<s> By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
<s> Like what?
<s> Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
<s> You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
<s> I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
<s> I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
<s> Did you get my note?
<s> Well, I only quote from the best.
<s> How?
<s> You've got a hormone deficiency.
<s> I'm not ready for marriage.
<s> Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
<s> I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
<s> Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
<s> That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich?
<s> How did you know!
<s> And some man will lose his.
<s> Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
<s> Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
<s> No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
<s> Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
<s> Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
<s> Empty as a football.
<s> We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
<s> Going on right here. It's a big night.
<s> It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
<s> Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
<s> How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
<s> That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
<s> No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> Homework. It's more interesting.
<s> Something too frightful to utter.
<s> Do you think I consider this recreation?
<s> I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
<s> A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.
<s> And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
<s> He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
<s> I don't know.
<s> Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.
<s> Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
<s> That's a suitcase?
<s> Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
<s> Is he cleaning house?
<s> It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
<s> It could be -- the knife, and the saw.
<s> How?
<s> Hi.
<s> Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
<s> You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
<s> You make any sandwiches?
<s> Yeah!
<s> Shoot, Jimbo.
<s> You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
<s> Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
<s> Sure.  Sure.
<s> Really, Frank?  When was that?
<s> A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
<s> Just relax, please relax!
<s> Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
<s> I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
<s> Hi there.
<s> No.  I don't think so--
<s> I hitched.
<s> Who's that!
<s> We know.
<s> Come on!
<s> I'm here.
<s> Just tell a little white lie?
<s> I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
<s> Pretty mixed up?
<s> You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
<s> Where what was.
<s> A what?
<s> I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
<s> Have you ever gone with anyone who--
<s> I feel as if I'm walking under water.
<s> There's just one thing.  What about--
<s> Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
<s> You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
<s> You said you'd call my father.
<s> Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
<s> C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
<s> Radio said negative five.
<s> No, hey, I like your coat --
<s> Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  What's good?!
<s> Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
<s> Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies.
<s> Beauty and fragrances.
<s> Your brother...
<s> Nick, no --
<s> You're not hearing me here --
<s> You told him about Nick's letters.
<s> For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
<s> Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now.
<s> All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
<s> Nick, what are you talking about?
<s> Yeah. That's love.
<s> Who wouldn't.
<s> Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
<s> I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
<s> Yes!
<s> Yes!
<s> She says a lot of things.
<s> Wish I had a brother like you.
<s> A station wagon in Canada.
<s> Hey.
<s> We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man.
<s> This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
<s> You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
<s> Get out.
<s> Don't tip.
<s> Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
<s> I don't steal any --
<s> Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
<s> Acid-chewer.
<s> And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
<s> My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
<s> Five years. Since it opened.
<s> Not with you.
<s> Where the hell's Gabriel?
<s> Yeah.
<s> YOU TELL HER!
<s> Well...sorry...
<s> There is no other table --
<s> I'M NOT NICK!
<s> Thanks, don't mind if I do.
<s> Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
<s> You don't hafta lift shit. You don't really work there. But as far as the records are concerned, you do. I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. You're on the schedule. You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know dock workers don't do too bad. So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti thinkin "what the fuck." And if Scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. Part of your job is goin' different places - and we got places all over the place.
<s> No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
<s> Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
<s> What?
<s> This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
<s> That's okay, Eddie, I do.
<s> Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
<s> How can you tell?
<s> Did the two of you talk?
<s> What about?
<s> Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.
<s> The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.
<s> You can do some crazy things with it.
<s> Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.
<s> I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
<s> Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
<s> Sorry, it's my book now.
<s> Nope.
<s> You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
<s> You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
<s> I can' take you to a hospital.
<s> Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
<s> This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
<s> That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
<s> What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
<s> Where?
<s> That was the plan, we meet here.
<s> He ain't dead.
<s> I don't know anybody.
<s> Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
<s> If we don't, he'll die.
<s> Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade?
<s> Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
<s> Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
<s> You can stay here if you like.
<s> Like sticking his nose into other people's business.
<s> Go on. Tell me more about her.
<s> Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.
<s> Maybe it's better that way.
<s> I suppose that's my fault.
<s> I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
<s> Maybe they will.
<s> Goodbye, Mary.
<s> To the other side of the street.
<s> Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
<s> You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
<s> The thing to do is stick to rabbits.
<s> Swimming.
<s> I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
<s> You want to split up? --
<s> Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China...
<s> All right, you didn't know.
<s> I don't care.
<s> He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
<s> Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
<s> They went on like I told you.
<s> I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
<s> Go ahead.  Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.
<s> Maybe you are. I'm not.
<s> What for?
<s> I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
<s> Don't you even know your letters?
<s> I sure would.
<s> Good night, Steve.
<s> It's a long ways yet.  I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.
<s> Steve --
<s> Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
<s> Wife?!
<s> Okay.
<s> I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.
<s> Great!!!
<s> Can you feel that?
<s> I know, but I've been thinking --
<s> Listen to me I --
<s> That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
<s> But he'll kill her!
<s> It's the sequel.
<s> Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
<s> Made you say it!
<s> Just wait, you'll see.
<s> Alright, let's take a vote...
<s> That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?
<s> Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
<s> Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
<s> That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
<s> What are you getting at, Professor?
<s> Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
<s> They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
<s> Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
<s> It's not what is looks like. She's having a breakdown. Help me get her to her room.
<s> Oh, I couldn't do that.
<s> Yours, or the turkeys?
<s> That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate.
<s> I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
<s> Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.
<s> What happened?
<s> You don't think...
<s> Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
<s> You said you hated him.
<s> I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
<s> God, Mom!  What's the matter?
<s> That's right.
<s> Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
<s> BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
<s> That's nice.
<s> Well, honey, chickadees breed in Alaska, you know. No wonder Dede's hungry. It's a long trip all the way to Baltimore.
<s> Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
<s> Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
<s> It's sugarless.
<s> Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
<s> Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
<s> But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
<s> If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
<s> ...Browsing.
<s> NO! I could never hurt anyone!
<s> Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
<s> Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
<s> If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
<s> Yes, I understand.
<s> It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
<s> Drink.
<s> But why? She's been ill --erratic, but I've never heard of anything like that!
<s> How much have you got?
<s> "The Dante?"
<s> She seems rather an odd woman to me.
<s> I guess most people are.
<s> Nothing.
<s> No. She asked about the trademark.
<s> Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging - waiting  I feel as if I'd never known her.
<s> Weren't you afraid?
<s> We've tried so long to find her.
<s> You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
<s> It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
<s> I don't know.
<s> We could tell him.
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't know.
<s> But it's a small room, Jason.
<s> It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
<s> Don't make me tell you, Jason.
<s> He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
<s> I keep telling myself that.
<s> She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
<s> One believes - it's like any other religion...
<s> I haven't said anything of the sort.
<s> I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
<s> Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
<s> Yes?
<s> No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
<s> I can quote that too; "Those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."
<s> I know this is difficult for you. I know that you love her.
<s> Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
<s> Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
<s> Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.
<s> Thank you.
<s> No.
<s> How do you mean?
<s> Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John.
<s> I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
<s> Impotent.
<s> Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
<s> Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
<s> Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
<s> Why not?
<s> Yes.
<s> I'm sorry this came up.
<s> Maybe you want to go.
<s> Yes.
<s> Ann, when would I have told you? We were not speaking, if you recall.
<s> What difference does it make why I do it?
<s> Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> How come?
<s> Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
<s> I'm not planning on it.
<s> That's very flattering.
<s> Not entirely.
<s> All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
<s> Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
<s> And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way.
<s> Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.
<s> Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
<s> Well, are you?
<s> Is that supposed to comfort me?
<s> I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
<s> Yes.
<s> What do you mean? I don't understand.
<s> Yes.
<s> Do you have to say that?
<s> You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
<s> Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
<s> But he won't.
<s> I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
<s> Well, what? Is he dangerous?
<s> Then why'd you call me?
<s> What kinds of questions?
<s> Well. I can't stay.
<s> So will you, someday.
<s> She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
<s> Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
<s> I just want to ask you questions.
<s> Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
<s> I turn on the camera. You start talking.
<s> Yes.
<s> Okay.
<s> Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
<s> Oh.  Well, when, then?
<s> What's so stupid about it?
<s> It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
<s> It hurts that you would say that to me.
<s> God, you... you're mean.
<s> I like having the car, the car is important.
<s> So is my wife, asshole!!
<s> No.
<s> Yeah.
<s> He'll be really mad.
<s> Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
<s> Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
<s> How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
<s> Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
<s> Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
<s> No. I don't think so.
<s> What do you want to call me at the office for?
<s> I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.
<s> Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm.
<s> We live in 703.
<s> Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
<s> Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
<s> I don't get it.
<s> Lemme clarify for you.
<s> I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
<s> YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME
<s> What?
<s> After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
<s> Dentonvale has been sold.
<s> Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
<s> Really.  What'll I pin this on?
<s> SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
<s> He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
<s> Sure thing.
<s> Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
<s> You're practically naked!
<s> OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!
<s> YOUNG BLOOD
<s> Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
<s> Do you really think so?
<s> But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
<s> Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.
<s> I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
<s> I don't think he intends to go that far.
<s> What does he know about it?
<s> YOU'RE NO GOOD
<s> ...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
<s> Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?
<s> Huh.
<s> Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
<s> Bottle.
<s> I'm good.
<s> Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
<s> If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
<s> I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.
<s> You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
<s> Sure I know Maya. Real well.
<s> A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
<s> I can't help the traffic.
<s> Yeah, Conundrum.
<s> Um... seventy... something.
<s> I'd rather have a knife.
<s> Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
<s> I told you. Filet and salmon.
<s> What color is it supposed to be?
<s> Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
<s> Pour us a couple.
<s> You know that chick?
<s> She is very hot.
<s> You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
<s> Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
<s> You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
<s> You have the keys.
<s> What?
<s> Okay! Fuck!
<s> Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
<s> Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.
<s> Understanding of what?
<s> You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Let's leave it alone.
<s> Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
<s> Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
<s> Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
<s> What's up?
<s> I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
<s> I don't know. I wouldn't know.
<s> What?
<s> Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
<s> Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
<s> Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
<s> So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
<s> Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.  Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
<s> I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
<s> She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
<s> So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
<s> Like what a fraud he was.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Good. So did I.
<s> Well, nice to see you now.
<s> Great. What's the latest we can get there?
<s> Don't touch me. Just take me home.
<s> Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
<s> Yeah.
<s> And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
<s> Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
<s> Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
<s> Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
<s> This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
<s> Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
<s> And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
<s> Only for pee or poop.
<s> This one?
<s> Are you going to do this or what?
<s> I heard.
<s> Yes it was.
<s> Yes.
<s> Ray Reddy's house.
<s> We have to go in the basement.
<s> Got it!
<s> A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now.  They're leaving. Beat.
<s> It's old Morgan.
<s> Who wrote this book?
<s> The footprints.
<s> Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
<s> What did you say?
<s> Sounds good.
<s> You'll never make it.
<s> Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
<s> This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
<s> In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
<s> I had to get up anyway.
<s> Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.
<s> The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
<s> Why?
<s> He'll be here.
<s> What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
<s> I'm done talking. Get out.
<s> Really?
<s> Don't press your luck, Carter.
<s> So this is the guy you're going to hang?
<s> I don't have any family any more.
<s> They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
<s> You don't know?
<s> Where's Emmett now?
<s> We'll handle that. He's careless.
<s> So we understand each other?
<s> So-called?
<s> He left me.
<s> Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
<s> I am telling the truth.
<s> Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
<s> Spare me.
<s> So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
<s> Good to see you too, Elaine.
<s> I'll send you her resume.
<s> Do what?
<s> She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
<s> Not quite.
<s> No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
<s> Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
<s> Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
<s> It was a great show, Dad...
<s> Because obviously she existed, right?
<s> Well, I --
<s> Why?
<s> Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
<s> I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
<s> I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
<s> Is she here tonight?
<s> Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
<s> Precisely.
<s> Night, Lainey.
<s> She did... didn't she?
<s> Lainey...
<s> Me and Simone.  What I did.
<s> What?!
<s> Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up.
<s> Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
<s> It's a yacht.
<s> I don't have time for this, Sayer.
<s> She looks a lot like you.
<s> Dark?
<s> Thank you.
<s> You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
<s> Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
<s> I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
<s> Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
<s> Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
<s> No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
<s> Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
<s> Dr. Crowe.
<s> Congratulations.
<s> Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.
<s> Words.
<s> Upset words.
<s> What?
<s> Me too.
<s> All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
<s> Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
<s> Yes.
<s> Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
<s> Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
<s> You do?
<s> Yeah.
<s> ...I don't know.
<s> I know.
<s> Cole, please stop.
<s> They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.
<s> Like what?
<s> You're a stuttering Stanley!
<s> --Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!
<s> It's our pleasure.
<s> Chuck E. who?
<s> Superstition.
<s> Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
<s> Slut.
<s> Bitch.
<s> Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
<s> -- "Billy-Jean" --
<s> This is his room... isn't it?
<s> She was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...
<s> Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
<s> Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Nothing to tell.
<s> Nah. Just you.
<s> This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
<s> Mmmm -- so can I...
<s> HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
<s> It's you. You and your father.
<s> You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
<s> Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
<s> I was getting 'warmed' up.
<s> Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --
<s> It's coming right up. After the third verse.
<s> Us? We been... moonlighting.
<s> Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
<s> Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
<s> New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
<s> Starla, it ain't --
<s> Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
<s> He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
<s> Okay.
<s> Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
<s> Shelby!
<s> What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
<s> Sorry.
<s> Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
<s> Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
<s> Shut up.
<s> My present?
<s> No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
<s> Grant, no!
<s> And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
<s> Gold--digger, huh?
<s> Margaret.
<s> Last year, this was a new rig.
<s> Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
<s> Having fun.
<s> Driving?
<s> We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
<s> You know, you're not a bad passenger.
<s> I would've come back for you.
<s> How do you know?
<s> You take the front, I'll take the back.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Well, thanks for the lift.
<s> Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
<s> But I still don't think...
<s> Redneck heaven.
<s> Can a pig whistle?
<s> I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.
<s> If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
<s> You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
<s> It's gonna be close. Real close.
<s> Yeah, but...
<s> What's up, Dixie Chicken?
<s> I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.
<s> Believe me, that won't be a problem.
<s> You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
<s> Chickenshit money.
<s> Maybe.
<s> The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
<s> ...About what?
<s> Then what --
<s> I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
<s> His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection.
<s> This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
<s> -- will be handled back in --
<s> -- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
<s> Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --
<s> No... We're trying to save Heller.
<s> Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
<s> Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
<s> Bag this fucker Buzzy.
<s> I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been.
<s> What are we talkin' on the split...
<s> 'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
<s> ...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
<s> I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
<s> -- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
<s> C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night?
<s> ...What are they doin' right now...?
<s> All right.
<s> Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
<s> Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
<s> Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters.  She walked into it and disappeared.  She was gone.
<s> Where's Sartorius?
<s> Why, who did you see?
<s> That depends.
<s> I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
<s> I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
<s> Into what?
<s> But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
<s> Why?
<s> I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
<s> I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
<s> Sartorius.
<s> No.  I love you.
<s> For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.
<s> Gibarian.  He was here.
<s> It's all right.
<s> You're lying.  I'm not human.
<s> Neither did I.
<s> Who are you, then?
<s> Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
<s> I want to stop taking those pills.
<s> Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.
<s> You didn't like him?
<s> You still writing the occasional magazine article?
<s> Hard to find doors in this place.
<s> There's a phone in the car.
<s> Queens... You know Queens?
<s> Not too sure about that.
<s> Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
<s> Listen, that was my fault.
<s> That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
<s> But "nice".
<s> Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
<s> They called here after you left...
<s> Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
<s> Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
<s> So.
<s> I don't know Tommy.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> I think -- she's crazy.
<s> I had to follow her to a store.
<s> She bought it.
<s> Did you hear what I said?!!
<s> You heard me.
<s> I watched TV.
<s> Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
<s> What about Tommy?
<s> I'm all right.
<s> Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess.
<s> I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
<s> No, sir...
<s> Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
<s> Okay, I guess.
<s> Mom and I got plans.
<s> No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
<s> I don't think she can sing, either.
<s> Let me see.
<s> I know.
<s> Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
<s> You're not half the idiot I am, Harry.
<s> Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
<s> Lemme down, bugface!
<s> Get away from me, freak!
<s> I think you're trying to tell me something.
<s> Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
<s> Mr. Jameson--
<s> Mr. Jameson--
<s> Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
<s> Frmpph-yrr.
<s> How about tomorrow?
<s> Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
<s> Just call me Spidey.
<s> Thanks, I already ate.
<s> Well...
<s> I'd never admit that.
<s> Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
<s> Do you mind if I come too?
<s> Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
<s> Oh, God, I forgot to--
<s> And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
<s> Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
<s> Any sign of our friend?
<s> Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
<s> Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
<s> Aunt May, what happened?
<s> I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
<s> Let's talk in the hall.
<s> I don't care.  Cretin.
<s> I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
<s> Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
<s> What?
<s> The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
<s> And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
<s> Phooey on that.
<s> Any news on Dunbar?
<s> There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
<s> That'll do.
<s> How come the Krauts knew about that stove, Security? And the tunnel? How come you can't lay down a belch around here without them knowing it?
<s> Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
<s> Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
<s> Take it.
<s> You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
<s> How much more do we have to take from him?
<s> No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
<s> I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
<s> I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
<s> Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
<s> I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
<s> Say, Schulz --
<s> Then droppen Sie dead!
<s> They'll shoot you, Animal!
<s> You're teasing me again!
<s> Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
<s> Come on, baby! Daddy's going to buy you a hunk of cheese!
<s> Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
<s> She'll never forgive me!
<s> So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.
<s> This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
<s> You want to go?
<s> You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
<s> One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
<s> Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
<s> A little weak today.
<s> Says who?
<s> He's a Nazi, Price is. For all I know, his name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school, gave him phony dogtags --
<s> They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
<s> Thirty-fifth.
<s> Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
<s> How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
<s> No! No!
<s> Not particularly.
<s> Russian women prisoners?
<s> Just don't drool on it.
<s> Tell you what to do. First, get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the Kraut guards. Then get yourself another face.
<s> Full disruptors.
<s> I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
<s> When is it expected back?
<s> Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
<s> Can you project its course?
<s> I believe so.
<s> Approximately two hundred thirty million.
<s> No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
<s> It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
<s> I hope so, sir.
<s> All hands, brace for impact!
<s> Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?
<s> She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
<s> I hadn't planned on it.
<s> You could say that.
<s> Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
<s> A photon torpedo?
<s> Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
<s> I was ordered to by the Captain.
<s> No.
<s> No, I didn't know that.
<s> I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
<s> Understood. That will be all.
<s> In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.
<s> What if I told you I found a new truth?
<s> Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
<s> Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
<s> All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
<s> If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
<s> Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
<s> Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.
<s> Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
<s> Locate.
<s> It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
<s> Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
<s> I have already made one transmission too many...
<s> My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
<s> And Spock with it. They are joined together.
<s> Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
<s> FULL IMPULSE POWER!
<s> Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
<s> Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
<s> No, sir, no response.
<s> Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
<s> As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
<s> Report status!
<s> Who is this?! How dare you --
<s> If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
<s> Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
<s> ... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
<s> But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
<s> But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
<s> Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
<s> Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
<s> But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
<s> I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't.
<s> Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
<s> We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI.
<s> The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
<s> Carol!
<s> Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.
<s> This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
<s> We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
<s> What do you want with us? I demand --
<s> You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order.
<s> How soon --
<s> Is that what you came here to say?
<s> <u>Full power damn you</u>!
<s> Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.
<s> Try the emergency channels...
<s> Admiral --
<s> We'll beam aboard. Alert transporter room --
<s> Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
<s> Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
<s> Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
<s> Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
<s> The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now --
<s> Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
<s> The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
<s> Aye sir --
<s> I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
<s> Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain.
<s> You may ask, Lieutenant.
<s> HURRY.
<s> We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...
<s> As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying: I like to think there always are possibilities.
<s> All stop, sir.
<s> Three minutes, thirty seconds.
<s> As you were, Mr. Saavik.
<s> Visual.
<s> Phasers locked...
<s> Try again.
<s> I'll try, Captain.
<s> Ready, sir.
<s> No power to the weapons system, sir.
<s> By the book...
<s> Where must you go?
<s> Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
<s> We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
<s> It'll come back to him.
<s> Spock, start your computations for time warp.  Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.
<s> If you have a better idea - now's the time.
<s> Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
<s> Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
<s> Not me, Bones... They did it.
<s> Acceleration is no longer a constant.
<s> Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
<s> I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
<s> I'm wery sorry, but --
<s> I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
<s> Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
<s> We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
<s> I was not.
<s> You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
<s> You've already been that. C'mon.
<s> Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
<s> Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
<s> We can't tell you.  Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.
<s> Implicitly.
<s> They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
<s> You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
<s> What's what?
<s> You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
<s> Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
<s> But Kirk...
<s> As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
<s> Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
<s> Yes.
<s> The hell I can't
<s> No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
<s> We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
<s> Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
<s> Out of control, and blind as a bat!
<s> The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.
<s> On my way...!
<s> No power to the bay doors.
<s> I will. Can my assistant come, too?
<s> ... Are you joking?
<s> It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
<s> It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
<s> Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
<s> We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
<s> You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
<s> More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
<s> It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
<s> By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do.
<s> Perhaps, that is true.
<s> No one's ever asked me that before.
<s> From the mission...
<s> What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
<s> What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
<s> In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
<s> Understood.
<s> Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
<s> Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
<s> We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...
<s> Do you have everything you need from command?
<s> When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment...
<s> So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
<s> And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
<s> Why not?
<s> Eject the core.
<s> Commander Riker...
<s> We're not going anywhere.
<s> Sir?
<s> Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
<s> Is there any other way to disable the injector?
<s> Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
<s> Or you could try lying down.
<s> Activating injector assembly.
<s> Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
<s> I'll be fine.  He's a different story.
<s> If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
<s> I wish to... go back to the way I was.
<s> My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
<s> Ready quantum torpedo.
<s> Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
<s> Let's go.
<s> Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
<s> Always am.
<s> Altitude fifty kilometers...
<s> Ready.
<s> Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
<s> There's a few of us left.
<s> It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
<s> I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
<s> Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
<s> You're lying.
<s> I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
<s> Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
<s> We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
<s> This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
<s> Fire.
<s> Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?
<s> I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
<s> Target...
<s> What kind of message?
<s> Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me? Chancellor...?
<s> And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
<s> In space, no one can hear you sweat.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> There... were no other ships in the sector.
<s> I am.
<s> Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
<s> Shields up. Battle stations.
<s> Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
<s> Good enough for one - two would look suspicious... killed while attempting escape... now that's convincing for both.
<s> They'll be here...
<s> Kill him! He's the one!!
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered.
<s> Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
<s> I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
<s> Sir?
<s> I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
<s> Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
<s> Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
<s> I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
<s> You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
<s> ... is to trust him.
<s> Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.
<s> Such things have happened before, sir.
<s> We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
<s> An error.
<s> Confirmed, Captain!
<s> We've been ordered to -
<s> Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Maybe we should write them a letter?
<s> But you didn't join a conspiracy.
<s> Because you are dangerous.
<s> You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
<s> Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
<s> He was a bit proud as I recall.
<s> Dying?
<s> I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
<s> That was another time.
<s> Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
<s> Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
<s> We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
<s> Negative.
<s> Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
<s> He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
<s> Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
<s> It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
<s> Emergency force fields are holding.
<s> Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
<s> Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.
<s> He wants to look me in the eye.
<s> Ready, sir!
<s> 
<s> Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
<s> Wont do what, Mister Worf?
<s> Captain!
<s> Who was it?
<s> Acknowledged ...  ...I'll talk to Data.
<s> Can anything be done for him?
<s> We can only hope so.
<s> I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
<s> Yes.
<s> There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
<s> Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go.
<s> Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
<s> Long ago.
<s> So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
<s> Please.
<s> I am.
<s> Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
<s> Yes, Praetor.
<s> They will obey, Praetor.
<s> There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
<s> Probably kids.
<s> How much are your rooms?
<s> It is beautiful.
<s> About five miles back.
<s> When can we expect containment?
<s> We don't know what else to do. We need results.
<s> Okay...
<s> He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
<s> Don't... don't do this... please...
<s> Ah no.
<s> Steering wheel.
<s> That way.
<s> No gas.
<s> It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
<s> No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
<s> This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
<s> Horses.
<s> My...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home.
<s> I need you.
<s> Is that a baby?
<s> A baby is a new person?
<s> But I speak English.
<s> We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
<s> I don't understand 'friend.'
<s> He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
<s> What is hell?
<s> I am your friend.
<s> I must meet my ship.
<s> Yes, they are.
<s> You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
<s> Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
<s> Yes.
<s> I will say that we can be friends.
<s> If you want to keep it, you can.
<s> Many, many days and nights...
<s> Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
<s> I must go.
<s> My grandmother's rich.
<s> What? No, of course not.
<s> If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
<s> Don't worry. I'll be all right.
<s> Give it a rest, Lyman.
<s> Save us all a lot of trouble.
<s> People have made mistakes in these situations before.
<s> You know that's impossible!
<s> You saw that?
<s> I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
<s> I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home.
<s> Hey, fuck you, man.
<s> You're going down.
<s> Forget it's there.
<s> Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
<s> I just got to talk to you for one second.
<s> I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
<s> What?  He gonna record you on his label?
<s> Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
<s> It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
<s> I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
<s> Yeah.  No, not really.
<s> But this is a bad one.
<s> He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
<s> That's pretty much the way it happened.
<s> Naawww.
<s> This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
<s> Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
<s> What clip?  What was it?
<s> Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
<s> Let's talk in the car.
<s> You'll see.
<s> I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
<s> No idea.
<s> I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
<s> So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
<s> Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
<s> Jesus, Mace!
<s> Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
<s> Fire's out, isn't it?
<s> I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
<s> Yeah, right, blow it open.
<s> It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
<s> Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
<s> Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
<s> Just Lenny.
<s> Aw, Mom!
<s> To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
<s> The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
<s> What's the bad news?
<s> Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
<s> What do you want from me?
<s> What about his killer?
<s> Who?
<s> Then why do I still have a badge?
<s> Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
<s> No, just coincidence. He knew who I was, of course. He had my ID -- did he keep it?
<s> Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
<s> I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
<s> In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
<s> The Academy, then CIIAC.
<s> Not especially.
<s> This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
<s> It explains a lot.
<s> This is some serious shit.
<s> I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
<s> No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
<s> Because you asked him to, stupid.
<s> Does one exist?
<s> It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
<s> Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
<s> Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?
<s> How do you know who's real and who's not?
<s> I already have an employer.
<s> Those were just fantasies.
<s> Something came up, Murman, my man.
<s> Sounds like fun.
<s> I screwed up twice, sir.
<s> Four hundred and sixty, sir.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us.
<s> It didn't feel that way.
<s> Enough. I've got to use the phone.
<s> No. Stop, come on.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Just like that?
<s> How was it hard?
<s> Oh. You know.
<s> I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
<s> ...and even then...
<s> No.
<s> ...I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud...
<s> They were auditioning for the same role as you?
<s> I'm a "Dorothy".
<s> ...And she's with someone else.
<s> Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
<s> No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
<s> Oh... right.
<s> I would love to see you again sometime.
<s> If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
<s> ...The red piece of shit over there...
<s> Why didn't you call?
<s> I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
<s> There's the rub.
<s> Thanks. Thanks, man.
<s> Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry.
<s> To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
<s> It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
<s> ..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
<s> He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.
<s> Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
<s> You always know the right thing to say.
<s> ...People get carjacked...
<s> Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679... 
<s> Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
<s> I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
<s> I don't know...
<s> Whu?
<s> Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
<s> Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
<s> But I lost! How can you say always?!?
<s> Thanks for clarifying that.
<s> Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
<s> She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
<s> It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
<s> They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it.
<s> "Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
<s> I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
<s> Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
<s> Hold on.
<s> See? And what does this guy she's with do?
<s> Aww... He got away?
<s> It starts at eight...
<s> What?
<s> What an asshole. Didn't you see "Boys in the Hood"? Now one of us is gonna get shot.
<s> That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
<s> No.
<s> You think?
<s> You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
<s> Now go over there and get those digits.
<s> Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
<s> You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
<s> I'll come to you when I need you.
<s> Understood.
<s> We gotta move...
<s> No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
<s> So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
<s> The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
<s> And with prison record.
<s> Yes.
<s> Tom said he'd take care of it.
<s> For bravery.
<s> I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
<s> This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
<s> Come Sunday morning:  My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village.
<s> Mike!
<s> And when they shot me father...
<s> You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
<s> An accident.  No one was hurt.
<s> I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
<s> Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give.  But he should try me again on anything else.
<s> Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny will never get that part because I hate that pinko punk and I'm going to run him out of the Movies.  And I'll tell you why.  He ruined one of Woltz Brothers' most valuable proteges.  For five years I had this girl under training; singing lessons!  Acting lessons!  Dancing lessons!  We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars--I was going to make her a star.  I'll be even more frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it wasn't all dollars and cents.  That girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass I've ever ad and I've had them all over the world.  Then Johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off.  She threw it all away to make me look ridiculous.  A MAN IN MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!
<s> How will they come at you?
<s> Michael...
<s> I told you you wouldn't like him.
<s> For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
<s> No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman.
<s> I love you.
<s> All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
<s> I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things.
<s> Cut it out.
<s> The kid's right.
<s> Probably a year...
<s> I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
<s> What guarantees can I give you?  I am the hunted one.  I've missed my chance.  You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce...
<s> I do renounce him.
<s> Be patient.
<s> Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
<s> What are you doing in Mongi?
<s> You just woke up!
<s> Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
<s> Okay, darling.
<s> Oh darling -- is that for me?
<s> That's funny.
<s> That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
<s> No, I think your mother, her illness --
<s> You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
<s> Copy out from here...
<s> Is Freddie here?
<s> I don't know! Why are you asking me?  How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
<s> You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
<s> Ripley's plans.
<s> Really? To Italy?
<s> Sure.
<s> It's Freddie. Let me in.
<s> Did this place come furnished? It doesn't look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? -- so bourgeois.
<s> In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
<s> Have you done something to your hair?
<s> Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
<s> Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
<s> Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
<s> Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Tom, you startled me! You're back.
<s> Ha. Did he say why?
<s> Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
<s> I think you're right.
<s> Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
<s> I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
<s> Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!
<s> I can explain.
<s> Shut up! Shut up!
<s> I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
<s> No glasses.
<s> I hope so.
<s> As in the...?
<s> Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.
<s> I know.
<s> I'll take them both.
<s> Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
<s> They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
<s> Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
<s> Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
<s> Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you.
<s> No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
<s> Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
<s> It's okay.
<s> I give up.
<s> Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
<s> I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
<s> Of course. What happened to your face?
<s> Even your fiance...?
<s> Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
<s> The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
<s> Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
<s> Huh?
<s> Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
<s> I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"
<s> He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
<s> Oh. Who was that again?
<s> Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> My God!
<s> Yeah.
<s> Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
<s> I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
<s> I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
<s> Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
<s> Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
<s> For a fee.
<s> And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
<s> Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
<s> It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
<s> Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
<s> O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
<s> Huh?
<s> I... I don't get along with people like that.
<s> I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
<s> Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? Pull over right here.  Why don't you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog!
<s> Why, thank you Travis.
<s> Damn straight.
<s> I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.
<s> We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
<s> Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there. 
<s> I'm no cop.  I want some action.
<s> Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
<s> Slow.
<s> Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
<s> That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
<s> Neither do I, I guess.
<s> You know how I feel about what you do.
<s> It's all I could think of.
<s> I'm not a fool, Billy.
<s> Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
<s> Hi.
<s> Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
<s> Okay.  What's the second thing?
<s> Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
<s> How'd they get it inside?
<s> Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...
<s> Have you got a cigarette?
<s> I don't smoke?
<s> Exactly.  And he got good.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
<s> Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
<s> Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
<s> Um... no.  I don't have a statement at this time.
<s> Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.
<s> By all means.
<s> Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
<s> But what?
<s> The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?
<s> Nine and-a-half years...
<s> Can't wait.
<s> Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
<s> Mother.  She's beautiful.
<s> Oh.  What... what time is it?
<s> You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
<s> No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
<s> You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
<s> The film broke...
<s> Did you... did you...
<s> Then I'll call you a cab.
<s> I guess I did.
<s> What's his rent?
<s> Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door shut when you leave.
<s> What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
<s> At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
<s> So, it is a blacklist.
<s> Yes.  Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
<s> I'm not sorry for what I said.
<s> I taught you that.
<s> No, I...
<s> You bet, honey.
<s> Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
<s> 'Course they all know me.  And I know all them.  Town's got my name, don't it?
<s> No.  No, not Miss Sinclair.  I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
<s> Yes.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
<s> A trifle.
<s> Just listen to them!
<s> If your father were here...
<s> Yep.
<s> Right here. Bodega Bay.
<s> Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
<s> Birds are not bad!
<s> Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
<s> Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
<s> I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
<s> I know, Mother.
<s> I know, Mother.
<s> If they are?
<s> He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
<s> Do I sound foolish to you?
<s> I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
<s> I think it might also matter to Mitch.
<s> Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
<s> Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
<s> Monday?
<s> Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
<s> All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
<s> I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
<s> No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
<s> What made it...
<s> Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
<s> I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
<s> You are, aren't you?
<s> His wife changed the channel.
<s> With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Like what?
<s> What about Thursdays and Fridays?
<s> I'm glad you do.
<s> The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
<s> Almost two a.m.
<s> No... wait.  Hold me.
<s> Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
<s> Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
<s> Can we go on living here otherwise?
<s> You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much.
<s> Of course.
<s> Ask this one favor --
<s> It is a pity.
<s> Where can I find him?
<s> You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
<s> Well? And are you not a good student?
<s> So she told me.  I'm a teacher -- not a practitioner.
<s> Gray killed her.
<s> Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
<s> He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
<s> It was a woman when we put her in.
<s> He was a nice horse.
<s> Your son, ma'am?  He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.
<s> A doctor?
<s> You will not have it?
<s> Afraid of what?
<s> I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
<s> Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
<s> What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
<s> I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
<s> In the brain, I tell you. I know.
<s> Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever.
<s> We have never been friends.
<s> Yes.
<s> Burke them?
<s> We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
<s> You sent them. I had no choice.
<s> You're wrong.
<s> A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
<s> I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
<s> No! Why are you haunting me?
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
<s> Yeah, we do.
<s> Good for you. You do know something.
<s> The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.
<s> Doubt is a motherfucker.
<s> Honey. I just can't.
<s> No.
<s> I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.
<s> It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
<s> We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
<s> That's what I came to see you about.
<s> I assure you such power exists.
<s> Yes.
<s> That's enough, Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.
<s> No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.
<s> I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
<s> Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
<s> Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
<s> Where is that?
<s> Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
<s> Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
<s> No -- I want to take you to the movies.  Do you think they'd accept these?
<s> Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
<s> He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
<s> Just Klaatu.
<s> About five months -- your months.
<s> I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
<s> The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle.
<s> I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
<s> Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
<s> You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
<s> That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
<s> May I see you for a minute?
<s> We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
<s> We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
<s> In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
<s> No -- I'm afraid not.
<s> This isn't a comic book store, right.  It's a bakery.
<s> He's my brother.
<s> Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
<s> We don't ride with vampires.
<s> Zero.
<s> The meanest!
<s> You don't have to beat me, Michael.  Just try to keep up.
<s> You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
<s> Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
<s> To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
<s> I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
<s> It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
<s> You have a T.V.?
<s> Whatcha doin' over here?
<s> Did we have a date tonight?
<s> Who, Laddie?
<s> I'm tired now.
<s> Mom... please.
<s> That's the boardwalk, Sam.
<s> Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
<s> C'mere, Nanook.
<s> Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
<s> If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
<s> Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
<s> They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
<s> Nanook...
<s> I don't know.
<s> Huh?...
<s> Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
<s> Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us.  Norris... you stay here...  Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  And everybody watch whoever you're with.  Real close.
<s> What for?
<s> Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
<s> Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
<s> Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
<s> A serum test possibly.
<s> No.
<s> What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
<s> Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
<s> I'm sure a lot of you already know.
<s> Why?
<s> You crazy?  He might be inside already?
<s> Then we go after him.
<s> MacReady, that you?
<s> Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
<s> Can you show us where they live?
<s> No...
<s> Alexander.
<s> As slaves.
<s> How?
<s> We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
<s> A man can change his history.
<s> No...
<s> Because...
<s> There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
<s> Why is it -- breaking up?
<s> You know I can't.
<s> I mean... well... affection.
<s> Not here... alone.  Please.
<s> No... let's walk through the city.
<s> Alex, it's just the zoo.
<s> Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
<s> What?
<s> You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
<s> That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
<s> I would.
<s> His home.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
<s> You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
<s> Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
<s> Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
<s> Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.
<s> Yes.
<s> What's it all for?
<s> Or mud carriers.
<s> It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
<s> So you can use it now?
<s> Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
<s> Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
<s> Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
<s> I took a different route.
<s> We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.
<s> Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
<s> That's quite enough, Kalen.
<s> I am.  Are you a climber?
<s> And you've no idea where he went?
<s> We never should have done this to him...
<s> [Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
<s> Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
<s> In where?
<s> Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
<s> They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
<s> How?
<s> No, we were patients.
<s> I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?
<s> I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
<s> They should just be looking harder.
<s> [Beat] What do you need me to do?
<s> I can't take you out of here in your condition...
<s> Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
<s> [Beat] What?
<s> I know.
<s> Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
<s> I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
<s> Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
<s> They're not.
<s> Good. How's your mom?
<s> I'm doing fine.
<s> He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
<s> I guess I'd ask you why.
<s> That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
<s> Why?
<s> You thought my father was crazy?
<s> I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
<s> Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
<s> You still don't believe me, do you?
<s> Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
<s> Is it true?
<s> I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
<s> [Beat] Thanks.
<s> Why "of course"?
<s> [Beat] I was dropped off.
<s> Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
<s> No, I'm ok.
<s> Yup. That's me.
<s> Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
<s> So you never knew your mother?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
<s> What.
<s> See ya.
<s> Yes, baby?
<s> What?
<s> I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
<s> Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
<s> Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
<s> Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
<s> Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
<s> Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
<s> Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.
<s> And smooth, boy, you are smooth.
<s> Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
<s> Fishing.  Look, Jimmy... I need you to help me.  This is serious.  I'm in trouble and I need you to help me.  Can you do that?
<s> What the fuck is going on?
<s> Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
<s> Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> Yes.
<s> Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
<s> Get the car.
<s> Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!
<s> Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
<s> Give me the keys.
<s> I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
<s> I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
<s> Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
<s> Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
<s> I don't know.  I won't be.
<s> Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
<s> Now what what?
<s> You mean now or before?
<s> You know those little dogs you see people with?
<s> Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
<s> Are you alright?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
<s> We can change our names.
<s> It'd have to be pretty good.
<s> Unbearable, I'd imagine.
<s> It's grand!
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Yeah, but he was successful.
<s> Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
<s> Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
<s> Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
<s> He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
<s> Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.
<s> Hm?
<s> But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
<s> Call you back.
<s> You got a brew?
<s> Big time.
<s> I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
<s> Yep.
<s> I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
<s> Pat Healy.
<s> It's right there on your golf bag.
<s> Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
<s> You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
<s> Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
<s> Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
<s> Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
<s> I said buttplug. She's heinous.
<s> Do what?
<s> Harvard?
<s> I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
<s> Maybe this'll jog your memory.
<s> You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
<s> Bullshit!
<s> What?
<s> No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
<s> That must make it tough.
<s> Hm?
<s> But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
<s> That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
<s> Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
<s> So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
<s> Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
<s> Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
<s> Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> Thanks.
<s> All right, let's go.
<s> You're Woogie?
<s> You forgot your keys!
<s> Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
<s> Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
<s> Oh.  Oh, that's a good one.
<s> Oh God.
<s> I wasn't trying --
<s> No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
<s> Tomorrow...
<s> What if I can't?
<s> -- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.
<s> Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
<s> And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
<s> Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
<s> Still heading for Cuba.
<s> Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
<s> Kids are supposed to get detention.
<s> -- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
<s> Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
<s> Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
<s> Good.
<s> Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
<s> I don't know. I don't know.
<s> I'm gonna protect those pilots.
<s> Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
<s> Just a second, Mr. President.
<s> -- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's the key?
<s> You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
<s> Check him out, Ray.
<s> Beats the hell outta me.
<s> That's right.
<s> Watch out!
<s> You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
<s> Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
<s> Is that right? What are the trees saying today?
<s> Why should I tell you.
<s> I don't see the connection.
<s> You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
<s> Don't tell me: heavy duty.
<s> What you call myths, we call our history.
<s> What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
<s> No. So we can do what the old man said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We have to go.
<s> Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
<s> You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
<s> Move it, Magdelana.
<s> No. No, no. Thank you.
<s> Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
<s> All I know... is I did what I did... and I ain't in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit. But I tell you what, Suit. Take me back. Cuz I can't take this shit no more.
<s> It's not that.
<s> I'm with someone.
<s> Yeow!
<s> How did you know this was my car?
<s> Two miles.
<s> You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.
<s> I thought there was something... That night in the club...
<s> The what?
<s> They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
<s> Winston Churchill.
<s> You always get what you want?
<s> I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
<s> True.
<s> That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
<s> I was, later.
<s> Well what?
<s> Well?
<s> Yes sir!
<s> These guys are getting on my nerves.
<s> I GOT ONE COMING UP.
<s> You go. I'm staying with it.
<s> Just relax.
<s> Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it!
<s> On what?
<s> Like what?
<s> What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
<s> No shit. The Iceman....
<s> COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL.
<s> Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
<s> I wouldn't call it victory.  It's more like...self immolation.
<s> I want him!
<s> Wood's okay. I want Viper.
<s> I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
<s> Was.
<s> Well, you'll just have to make do with him .
<s> NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
<s> WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
<s> NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING.
<s> No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
<s> I talked a man back once. Three months later, we lost him. It's his decision. Only he knows.
<s> Sir?
<s> Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
<s> My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
<s> You think I should quit?!
<s> Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
<s> The Last Resort!  Quick!
<s> But maybe you can change all that.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Sorry.  Too perfect.
<s> Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up...
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
<s> I've been trying to tell you.  Someone erased his memory.
<s> Eight years.
<s> I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
<s> That's right.
<s> No need to be rude.  I'll do it.
<s> Arrest that woman!
<s> Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.
<s> Melina!
<s> Up to the right.
<s> What the hell is this?
<s> Quit while you're ahead.
<s> Yeah, sweetheart?
<s> Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
<s> Some men just tried to kill me!
<s> You went to those brain butchers?!
<s> Oh God, Doug.
<s> I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
<s> Beats me.  I just work here.
<s> Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?
<s> That a problem?
<s> You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
<s> I love you.
<s> I guess he didn't.
<s> Hauser left me a note.
<s> He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
<s> Jump!
<s> The one in the mine!
<s> Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
<s> I gave you?
<s> Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."
<s> What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
<s> Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
<s> Do not talk to the driver.
<s> What the hell do we know about seismographs?
<s> We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
<s> In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
<s> Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
<s> Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
<s> You got that right.
<s> Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
<s> That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
<s> First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
<s> Civil?  I'm civil.
<s> She just practically asked you for a date.  What the hell is wrong?!
<s> Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
<s> You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
<s> Let's assume that it is.
<s> Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
<s> I'm dead. We're both dead.
<s> That-a-boy. Hospital.
<s> Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
<s> Let go of my hair.
<s> Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
<s> Shut your sewer mouth!
<s> What about entrapment?
<s> Can't I take a simple piss without --
<s> I can describe it.
<s> Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
<s> I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
<s> Hey. You plan to be a criminal defense attorney, know this going in: Everybody's guilty.
<s> Look -- I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie.
<s> Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
<s> Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent.
<s> That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.
<s> I'm not that desperate.
<s> I've seen this picture before.
<s> Neither.
<s> "Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
<s> Screw you too, Kitty.
<s> About Chinatown. What went down.
<s> It's okay, Eddie.
<s> See-cil.
<s> Shu Kai Kim.
<s> This and that.
<s> Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
<s> We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
<s> -- alleged crime --
<s> I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
<s> -- Eddie told you?
<s> That's right.
<s> No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
<s> I was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around.  If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.
<s> Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
<s> Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
<s> Bobby...
<s> Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
<s> You're lucky I am not wasting you.
<s> I am going over here.
<s> Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
<s> That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
<s> Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
<s> I think I'll take off my badge as well.
<s> Smell something fishy, huh?
<s> YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
<s> What?
<s> Ever see her with someone else?
<s> She only worked here a month. Nice girl. Never seemed to get here on time though. Ask me she had a little problem with --
<s> I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
<s> Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
<s> Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
<s> Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
<s> She's wearing a ring.
<s> Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
<s> I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
<s> If I can smoke it.
<s> Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
<s> You mean Fred and Ginger?
<s> Nothing.
<s> Maybe.
<s> I already made you two tapes.
<s> Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
<s> You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
<s> I can't tonight.
<s> That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
<s> Fish eyes?
<s> Mom, take it easy.
<s> Good night, sweetheart.
<s> But my name isn't Leland Palmer.
<s> Fine.
<s> Yes.
<s> Stay away from me.
<s> Oh, Leland.
<s> Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
<s> Nothing, I chickened out.
<s> As if I didn't know.
<s> There's no one here.
<s> As far as we know, nothing.
<s> Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
<s> No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
<s> All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
<s> Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
<s> Yes. It would be.
<s> Gruber...
<s> What does it mean?
<s> It's a crime.
<s> Yes.
<s> I thought I would need it.
<s> No.
<s> I know of him.
<s> I'm on the staff of...
<s> Objection.
<s> And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
<s> Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
<s> Tell me one?
<s> Yes.
<s> My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
<s> Hold on a second.
<s> I understand.  I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
<s> It was good of you to meet...
<s> That's what I'd planned to...
<s> Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
<s> You're going to settle out of court?
<s> Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
<s> ...that's perfectly all right.
<s> These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
<s> Why is that?
<s> Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
<s> Overruled...
<s> Noted. Thank you.  Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness. Her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed...
<s> I changed my room at the Hotel.
<s> Laura.
<s> And are they going to get it?
<s> You're talking like a drunk.
<s> I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
<s> Let me talk to Mickey.
<s> ...I'm sure you do...
<s> ...and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent...
<s> Dr. Gruber's not in.
<s> Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
<s> That's for sure, Frank.
<s> What do you want?
<s> We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
<s> I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
<s> Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
<s> Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
<s> The Doctors.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
<s> Yes.
<s> Should I?
<s> Huh.
<s> He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
<s> I didn't know how to stop you...!
<s> There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?
<s> It's gone now.
<s> It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
<s> But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
<s> I liked him.
<s> It might give us something.
<s> If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
<s> No.  I thought you had them.
<s> Are they sure it's a meteor?  It didn't come down like one.
<s> I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.
<s> So is the town, I notice!
<s> Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
<s> Chase, you'd better come home.
<s> What?  What kind of episode?
<s> I'll be there in three hours.
<s> No...
<s> Is he all right?
<s> Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp.  For Dylan's sake.
<s> Finish, please!
<s> Say how they find their way back home.
<s> He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
<s> Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
<s> Home, that's right.
<s> Coming for you...
<s> The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
<s> When it is denial.  I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
<s> Steady...
<s> Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
<s> Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
<s> Yeah, sure.
<s> Yes?
<s> Well, see, he's gotten used to being Freddy now.  And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  So...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.
<s> Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
<s> Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
<s> Coffee'd be nice.
<s> He knows.
<s> Yes, Sir.
<s> Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!
<s> It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
<s> Because it looks good.
<s> It was a bad dream...
<s> They don't know that.  We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  I'm a kid.
<s> Me too.
<s> Do what?
<s> All stop on the engine.
<s> You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
<s> It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
<s> It will be more than that, I can promise you.
<s> I should be eating with the crew.
<s> It has nothing to do with him.
<s> We'll think of something.
<s> I can show you how to use a slide rule.
<s> Come on, he didn't mean anything.
<s> On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
<s> You know what he is talking about here?
<s> He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly.
<s> There are some things that everybody does in the same language.
<s> I don't know...
<s> What makes you so sure it was one?
<s> You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
<s> The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
<s> I am accountable.
<s> I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
<s> This be it?
<s> You an indian?
<s> She really say she was pregnant?
<s> Like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby...
<s> Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol.  Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.
<s> Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
<s> That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Set one up.
<s> No sir...
<s> We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.
<s> We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
<s> In many capacities.
<s> No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
<s> Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
<s> See ya downstairs.
<s> Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
<s> 'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
<s> You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
<s> At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
<s> She got me an abortion...
<s> You up for that?
<s> Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
<s> You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
<s> What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
<s> You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
<s> Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
<s> Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
<s> You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.
<s> One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it.
<s> You certain?
<s> No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
<s> We'll find out in a hurry.
<s> This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
<s> Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
<s> What's that?
<s> I'm afraid she is, baby.
<s> No radio or TV...
<s> Fan works.
<s> Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
<s> The only one.
<s> Yeah?
<s> I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
<s> Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
<s> I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
<s> I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
<s> What?
<s> What makes sense, is all.
<s> Damn!
<s> What time's Sailor's train get in?
<s> Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
<s> What if I told you not to?
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
<s> Yes.
<s> Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
<s> Santos... I can't...
<s> What?
<s> No...
<s> Shhhhhh...  Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now...
<s> No.
<s> You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
<s> Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
<s> Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
<s> We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
<s> The candelabras were my Gran's.
<s> Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
<s> She's still a transvestite.
<s> Just go around him.
<s> Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
<s> Only in your bones?
<s> Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
<s> My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
<s> ...we find the jacket.
<s> Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
<s> Gee, I don't know, Crabs...  Improvise. You're good at that.
<s> I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.
<s> Her dog, yes.
<s> They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
<s> No sweat. Only do me a favor?
<s> Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
<s> With Emily?
<s> Just what? Doing a little dusting?
<s> So I'm told.
<s> She is. Ah. Here we go...
<s> What's he saying?
<s> You're welcome.
<s> Who?
<s> Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
<s> Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
<s> Hm.
<s> No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
<s> James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
<s> Amazing.
<s> Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
<s> Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
<s> You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
<s> James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.
<s> I didn't mean it that way.
<s> I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
<s> Ah, wear whatever you want.
<s> It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.
<s> I think so... What about you?
<s> Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
<s> Oh. Well. I...
<s> I told you, Sewickly Heights.
<s> I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.
<s> Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
<s> Walter just got it back from the framer today.
<s> She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
<s> Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
<s> No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
<s> James Leer.
<s> I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
<s> Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
<s> Why yes. How did you know?
<s> It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
<s> He's still barking at me. He's blind.
<s> That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
<s> Jesus. Is that what he told you?
<s> This is important.
<s> Oh... yeah.
<s> It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
<s> I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
<s> Give me a break, Grady.
<s> I haven't heard of half of those.
<s> I doubt it, darling.
<s> Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
<s> I like the noise.
<s> Is it because of Anna?
<s> You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
<s> How old is Anna?
<s> Huh?
<s> It wasn't like that.
<s> She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
<s> You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
<s> Sure.
<s> When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
<s> Not yet.
<s> What?
<s> Yes.
<s> Little Red Riding Hood.
<s> If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
<s> I said the job is okay.
<s> That was a joke.
<s> Of course.
<s> You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
<s> They usually tell me.
<s> Is this the first one?
<s> You mean my problem?
<s> What?
<s> Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
<s> Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
<s> In my bed too.
<s> All right.
<s> Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
<s> No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
<s> What do you think?
<s> I like the noise.
<s> Yeah?
<s> What?
<s> Not tonight.
<s> Hi.
<s> Twelve years in prison?
<s> No. Never again.
<s> Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that.
<s> Why young girls, Walter?
<s> I know.
<s> Who doesn't?
<s> You're such an asshole.
<s> We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
<s> Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!!
<s> I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
<s> No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go any further in.
<s> Wasn't up to me.
<s> I'm switching off now.
<s> Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
<s> Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
<s> Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
<s> Chill out, Lindsey!!
<s> Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
<s> Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this--
<s> They'll come out after us.
<s> I don't know, look around.
<s> Calm down, Bud.
<s> NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
<s> WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
<s> I can't afford slack, Brigman.
<s> Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
<s> God, I hate that bitch.
<s> Yuh?
<s> I can't... make it... podner.
<s> Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
<s> Turn it up, bozo.
<s> Neutron counter's not showing very much.
<s> That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
<s> Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
<s> Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  I believe the stress is affecting you.  Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer.
<s> We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
<s> Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
<s> I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
<s> He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
<s> Check this out.
<s> Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
<s> Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
<s> So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
<s> I'm certainly not going to swim across.
<s> You already know what they are.
<s> It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
<s> Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
<s> But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
<s> Well, what?
<s> And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed.
<s> I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
<s> Occasionally, but always with affection.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
<s> As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square.
<s> Nothing.
<s> I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him. And as far as telephoning him... Who knows where he is?
<s> Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.
<s> No.
<s> But then why did you bother changing?
<s> I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
<s> More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
<s> But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
<s> I detest comparisons made with oil.
<s> He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
<s> So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
<s> Anybody can hold a brush in his hand. All you need is to buy some oils and start painting. Even Rembrandt did the same.
<s> Here I am.
<s> Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
<s> Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
<s> But for you, what comes first: music or love?
<s> Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
<s> There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
<s> Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.
<s> They didn't seem too good.
<s> I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
<s> You're kidding!
<s> Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
<s> Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary.
<s> Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
<s> My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
<s> What would you like to talk about.
<s> Right now?
<s> At least once a week.
<s> In the confessional.
<s> How were you sick?
<s> Where'd it come from before that?
<s> Does it bother you?
<s> Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
<s> I don't know.
<s> She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
<s> Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
<s> No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
<s> You'll laugh.
<s> I could never be a mother.
<s> A mistake...
<s> Everything... I don't have children.
<s> I'm not sick.
<s> No...
<s> Yes.
<s> ... makes me...
<s> Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
<s> Alright.
<s> No I'm not.
<s> Yes I am.
<s> To help me.
<s> Yes.
<s> May I open my eyes now?
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
<s> Go away, I don't want you here.
<s> Yes.
<s> How did she know about him?
<s> Agnes who did you see?
<s> She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
<s> You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.
<s> How do you survive?
<s> The one up on the third floor?
<s> Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
<s> She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
<s> Yes.
<s> We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
<s> If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
<s> That possibility never occurred to you?
<s> When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
<s> And you weren't shocked?
<s> And what happened?
<s> I hate ignorance and stupidity.
<s> I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
<s> There's another choice.
<s> Yes.
<s> She drank too much. That's what killed her.
<s> Oh, dear God.
<s> Oh God, if only I'd known.
<s> I knew that after the fact.
<s> Don't deny it!
<s> Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
<s> Stupid woman... and that's all?
<s> Long, thin and filtered.
<s> Right...
<s> How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
<s> You're saying God did it?
<s> You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
<s> Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her?  You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why?
<s> She didn't want any help.
<s> Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
<s> Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Read 'em!
<s> No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.
<s> Bag-snatcher.
<s> Oh, my God, he's a natural.
<s> Yeah, grotesque.
<s> I don't care.
<s> And who's this Susan when she's at home?
<s> Ah well. Eh, look!
<s> He's sulking again.
<s> You crawler.
<s> What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?
<s> It's Paul's grandfather.
<s> Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
<s> The big hammer?
<s> See you.
<s> Well ... what's the matter with that?
<s> Out where?
<s> Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
<s> Lip reading.
<s> Eh?
<s> What's he on about?
<s> It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
<s> Oh yes, he's clean all right.
<s> Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
<s> Hiding.
<s> Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
<s> No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
<s> Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
<s> Eh, don't take out me lines.
<s> You needn't bother.
<s> He started it.
<s> Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.
<s> What?
<s> I would have said so.
<s> I knew I could rely on you.
<s> Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
<s> Y'what?
<s> Good lad, Ringo.
<s> Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
<s> I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
<s> Oh, down the ... er ...?
<s> Oh, him... He's been lurking.
<s> Is that you, Roby?
<s> Or something will be able to see us.
<s> Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
<s> Point eight six.  We can walk on it.
<s> There are no commercial lanes out here.  Face it, we're out of range.
<s> I'll see what I can do.
<s> Is it solid?
<s> God I'm hungry.
<s> I think that's a pretty reasonable request.
<s> Play it for us, please.
<s> Unknown.
<s> Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
<s> I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
<s> Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
<s> Shit...
<s> It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
<s> Damn it!  How long to fix?
<s> Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
<s> Right.
<s> I kind of like it.
<s> All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust.  Hunter and I will make up the second team.
<s> Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear protective garments, including helmets.  Let's get down to the locker and change.
<s> The flamethrower needs more fuel.
<s> What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
<s> Let me go first; you stay behind me.
<s> No.
<s> Jay, this is Cleave!  Meet me at the main air lock!
<s> I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
<s> Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
<s> Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
<s> All right.  Now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise.  Martin, do you read me?
<s> How far?
<s> <u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!
<s> What is it?
<s> Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
<s> All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
<s> That tube must be depositing it in him.
<s> Yeah?
<s> What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
<s> He went into the pyramid alone.  We lost radio contact with him.  When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him.
<s> Let's take her into an escape orbit.
<s> By eating our food supplies.
<s> Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
<s> Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed.  And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
<s> Kablooey.
<s> Sure.
<s> Yeah...
<s> Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
<s> Thanks.
<s> Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
<s> Okay, give me the numbers.
<s> We're what!?
<s> Too many.
<s> Has anybody talked to them?
<s> Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
<s> That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.
<s> Anything you say, Mammacitta.
<s> It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> You've checked that end?
<s> Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
<s> Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.
<s> Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
<s> Hold on...
<s> Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow.
<s> Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
<s> What time's sundown?
<s> It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
<s> I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
<s> I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
<s> I'm not enough for a paragraph.
<s> Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.
<s> You could sleep, too, couldn't you?
<s> What else?
<s> The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
<s> We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
<s> Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!
<s> She never proved anything, not a thing!
<s> Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?
<s> You're being childish.
<s> Very well. I shall drop you and go on to the party. I have no intention of missing it...
<s> Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
<s> As soon as the peasants stop pawing her.
<s> The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
<s> Show me a human and I might have!
<s> - in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
<s> You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night-  - aren't we, honey?
<s> Cut it out.
<s> I thought you were going to be late-
<s> Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?
<s> I'm trying terribly hard.
<s> You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
<s> Hear, hear...
<s> He does not exaggerate. I was good.
<s> You know what I'm going to be?
<s> I'm going to have a home. Not just a house I'm afraid to stay in... and a man to go with it. I'll look up at six o'clock - and there he'll be... remember, Karen?
<s> Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
<s> It's only one picture deal.
<s> Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...
<s> Everything.
<s> From what would I be running?
<s> Your make-up's a little heavy.
<s> No thanks, Birdie.
<s> But she just got here...
<s> If I haven't, I'll find something till you're normal.
<s> Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
<s> See you home...
<s> I couldn't get into the girdle in two an' a half hours...
<s> No.
<s> Now you want an argument.
<s> Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
<s> The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
<s> Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
<s> Miss Harrington...
<s> I've heard of them.
<s> I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
<s> Hollywood.
<s> I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
<s> The show must go on.
<s> Of course.
<s> There can't be very much-
<s> - and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
<s> - and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
<s> Let's not get over-dramatic.
<s> Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
<s> I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
<s> You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
<s> Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
<s> I had no idea you knew each other.
<s> The heave-ho.
<s> Harrington.
<s> I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
<s> None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
<s> We've all seemed a little tense lately...
<s> Well... all right.
<s> Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
<s> When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
<s> That's quite a change of subject.
<s> I'm trying hard to follow you.
<s> Such as?
<s> I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
<s> Nothing...
<s> Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
<s> How do you mean?
<s> Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
<s> She was a revelation...
<s> That's beside the point.
<s> Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?
<s> City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...
<s> It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
<s> We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
<s> Go ahead, please...
<s> I just played it.
<s> Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
<s> I love you, Max. I really mean it. I love you. Come to the pantry.
<s> This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
<s> About the past year.
<s> --fifteen phone calls--
<s> It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?
<s> Facts or theory?
<s> Nixon.
<s> --we will--
<s> --shit--
<s> --I know, I know--
<s> Who?
<s> Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
<s> --and the FBI confirms--what more do you need?--
<s> --Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
<s> John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
<s> Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
<s> On the orders of Haldeman?
<s> --goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
<s> --Deep Throat?--
<s> Absolutely--
<s> Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
<s> Who were they?
<s> Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and I put it in the office safe which was crammed.
<s> And we'll all have to go to work for a living.
<s> My non-denial denial.
<s> Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record.  Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.
<s> I have nothing more to say.
<s> Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
<s> Mitchell knew then.
<s> Haldeman too?
<s> Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
<s> Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
<s> I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
<s> Howard Hunt here.
<s> I think so.
<s> Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
<s> Hunt is Colson's man--  --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel--  --they both went to Brown University--  --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.
<s> I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
<s> Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story.
<s> I'm not Miss Abbott.
<s> Sorry.
<s> You need some work, buddy!
<s> Like what?
<s> When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
<s> I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
<s> First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
<s> Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
<s> Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
<s> That's nice.
<s> What's that?
<s> You called me Oz.
<s> What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
<s> Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
<s> You mean...and orgasm?
<s> No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
<s> Finch, you got the Latin homework?
<s> No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
<s> Do you know about the clitoris?
<s> Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
<s> Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
<s> Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
<s> Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.
<s> Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
<s> "Fun loving" -- insane.
<s> Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
<s> Oh -- no way.  I can't do that to her.
<s> Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
<s> Uh...yeah...sorry.
<s> Oh no.
<s> Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
<s> Not for you.
<s> No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
<s> No...I know the perfect time...
<s> Yeah.  Are you sure?
<s> Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
<s> I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
<s> Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!
<s> Ready for what?
<s> Qualify for what?
<s> What's that?
<s> Dude, prom sucks.
<s> I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it.  And that leaves you trailing, Jim.  You gotta get your act together.
<s> I don't care.
<s> Yep.
<s> Uhh! Would you die already!
<s> What?
<s> It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
<s> Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
<s> Are you okay?
<s> Andy! No!
<s> Fuck me...
<s> "Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
<s> You too.
<s> FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
<s> What?!
<s> But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
<s> What about me?
<s> Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
<s> My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.
<s> Andy? Andy is that you?
<s> The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
<s> Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
<s> You fucking liar!
<s> Yes sir.
<s> But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
<s> Well, I don't have any money . . .
<s> I'm fine.
<s> I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
<s> You must have.
<s> Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
<s> Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
<s> Why?
<s> I'm glad you	did too.
<s> I'll never let go!
<s> THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
<s> You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
<s> Ew. . .  the honest type.
<s> Pray he's color-blind...
<s> She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
<s> STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
<s> And tell me that she's happy.
<s> Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
<s> Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
<s> No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
<s> Come on.
<s> This guy's on television.
<s> Alvy Singer over here!
<s> Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
<s> Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here... in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny.
<s> Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
<s> Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
<s> Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
<s> It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
<s> Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
<s> Hey, that was last year.
<s> Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
<s> Me? Oh, downtown!
<s> I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
<s> Well, I do commercials, sort of...
<s> I'll getcha a piece.
<s> Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
<s> M'hm...
<s> No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
<s> think that's, uh-
<s> You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
<s> That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
<s> Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You don't want me to live with you?
<s> That place is four hundred dollars a month?
<s> U-huh.
<s> Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
<s> so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
<s> C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
<s> Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
<s> Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!
<s> G-go on, I'm interested.
<s> Whatta you mean? Me?
<s> Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
<s> Will it change your wife?
<s> And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh. What?
<s> Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
<s> I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
<s> Holy cow!
<s> What... huh?
<s> Thing?
<s> No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
<s> Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I never...
<s> Remember that day?
<s> Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
<s> Step up here!
<s> Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart."
<s> Don't get upset!
<s> Whatta you mean?
<s> You stopped smoking sixteen years ago, is that what you said? Oh, I-I don't understand. Are you joking, or what?
<s> Ah, Max, you, uh...
<s> Right, Max. California, Max.
<s> Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
<s> Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
<s> Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
<s> Oh, Jesus.
<s> Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old.
<s> If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.
<s> Oh, yes, yes.
<s> ...of possibly working together.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I was a great beauty.
<s> A long time.
<s> You should talk to Mr. Joe.
<s> She's got great tits.
<s> I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors.
<s> Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
<s> Things always look much worse in the morning.
<s> I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute.
<s> Didn't I say?
<s> It's not going to come up.
<s> Don't you miss it?
<s> Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
<s> Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Damn straight.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Escape hatch.  And Dad was having a go about the garden.  Something was misplanted...
<s> Harry called.
<s> Monica.
<s> You have?
<s> Fantastic.  Out here.
<s> I'm ready.
<s> No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
<s> Who'd like to go and find Otis?
<s> Dinner.  Don't be angry.
<s> He'll find his way back.
<s> Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
<s> Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
<s> Don't do this.
<s> What?!  You aborted our child?!
<s> You're not ready.
<s> Oh, you know, I am.
<s> She'll never call again.  She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally?
<s> Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
<s> Ah there's our snookums now.
<s> Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
<s> Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?
<s> Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
<s> I will treasure this.
<s> Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
<s> Lemon.
<s> Come here.
<s> Clair is a hovering mother.
<s> Time!
<s> I'm not going to leave you alone.
<s> You're not serious.
<s> Don't go in, Ryan.
<s> Oh?
<s> Do Peter Sellers again.
<s> Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
<s> It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
<s> It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
<s> I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Thanks.
<s> I guess.
<s> Hm.
<s> Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
<s> No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
<s> It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
<s> I'm Princess Bala.
<s> Divinely?
<s> No...as a matter of fact...
<s> I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
<s> How should <u>I know</u>?
<s> Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
<s> Want a list?
<s> Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
<s> You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
<s> Mom!
<s> I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
<s> Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!
<s> Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
<s> Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
<s> Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
<s> Oh, no, sir!
<s> I...I have no idea, sir.
<s> I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
<s> But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
<s> Why are we so successful?
<s> But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
<s> Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
<s> My mother.
<s> Yeah.  How much?
<s> I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
<s> That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
<s> Sheldrake?
<s> Yeah.  I better not get too close.
<s> Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
<s> I should have stayed in bed last night.
<s> Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
<s> What time does the show go on?
<s> Oh.
<s> I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
<s> You shouldn't.
<s> Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
<s> Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
<s> I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
<s> Let me help you.
<s> I just want to go brush my teeth --
<s> Someone from the office.
<s> Baxter.
<s> Miss. 
<s> He doesn't give a damn about me.
<s> Give what up?
<s> A cemetery?
<s> Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
<s> You bet. I got a terrific hand.
<s> So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
<s> Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
<s> I don't want to talk to him.
<s> Are you supposed to?
<s> As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
<s> I guess so.
<s> I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
<s> Where?
<s> No -- just come as you are.
<s> You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
<s> What?
<s> That's very wise.
<s> Seven --  -- queen.
<s> Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
<s> What for?
<s> I don't know.
<s> What kind of joint are you running?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
<s> So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
<s> Oh?  Oh!
<s> The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
<s> Roger. And I'll get that other key.
<s> Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
<s> You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> No I didn't.
<s> I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
<s> Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
<s> Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
<s> I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
<s> Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
<s> Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
<s> Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month -- and if I were in bed for a month --
<s> My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
<s> Let me get my bag.
<s> I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
<s> Just as long as she's okay.
<s> Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
<s> Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
<s> Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
<s> Happy New Year.
<s> She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
<s> Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
<s> Good night.
<s> A.W.O.L.?
<s> Dr. Dreyfuss.
<s> No.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
<s> Handle what?
<s> I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
<s> Stop that, Fran.
<s> Baxter?
<s> First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
<s> What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
<s> Sssssh.
<s> Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
<s> See if they'll what?
<s> Yeah --
<s> I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
<s> That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men --
<s> Esprit de corps --
<s> Get out --
<s> Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
<s> At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
<s> Yeah -- you can really get hung up on them like the cat in the Delta.
<s> Call me what, sir?
<s> Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.
<s> Looks that way.
<s> God knows.
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
<s> Let's go.
<s> We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
<s> I'll go with him --
<s> All right I got a little surprise for you --
<s> We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
<s> This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes.
<s> This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
<s> In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light.
<s> We're Americans.
<s> I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
<s> Signs?
<s> Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
<s> What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
<s> They must have seen the fire.
<s> He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
<s> But why ?
<s> A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
<s> Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
<s> What, sir?
<s> What?
<s> Yeah -- yeah, I can understand how you feel.
<s> It's still pretty hairy, sir.
<s> No. Walked.
<s> Music?
<s> We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You can't have water after morphine.
<s> How's the pain?
<s> I can handle it.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> No -- leave it --
<s> Why did they attack us?
<s> You're Australian?
<s> Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
<s> I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
<s> The river is beautiful.
<s> They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
<s> You can pack out of here -- two, three days' hike along this river at most.  Weather should hold this early in the season.
<s> Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.
<s> 175  CONTINUED:
<s> So they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
<s> There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.
<s> 168  CONTINUED:
<s> Back against the bars.  Now.
<s> Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
<s> Sam?  We haven't seen him.
<s> Why?
<s> Come here...
<s> That's my line.
<s> Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
<s> A daughter in Oregon.
<s> I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
<s> You got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger?
<s> I don't plan on dying.
<s> We've got another two hours of daylight.
<s> Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
<s> You broke the radio, remember?
<s> I'm living proof of that sad fact.
<s> Sure.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> -- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
<s> Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
<s> I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
<s> Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.
<s> Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
<s> Huh?
<s> Come on. Why fight when we know how it will come out. This isn't like stocking or a string of pearls. You don't send this one back.
<s> Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
<s> He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
<s> Since forever.
<s> Emergency room only.
<s> No.
<s> His name?
<s> If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
<s> Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
<s> Yes.
<s> A thank-you note for what you did for me.
<s> Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Two days.
<s> You like sad stories -- you want mine.
<s> Fries.
<s> Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
<s> I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
<s> Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
<s> I had to see you...
<s> Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.
<s> I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
<s> No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
<s> So am I, Frank.
<s> I'm not saying nothing to you.
<s> He's a pain in the ass.
<s> Okay by me.
<s> Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
<s> How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
<s> Ask him.
<s> No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
<s> Get out.
<s> Got any easier questions?
<s> Never a break. Never.
<s> This stuff is pointless.
<s> Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
<s> No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
<s> Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.
<s> Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
<s> Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
<s> But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
<s> I'd love to sit in that jury.  Send that S.O.B. right to the chair.
<s> No fucking way.
<s> I ain't scared of you.
<s> Oh, yeah.
<s> Why don't you tell me.
<s> Do you want Rath or not?
<s> Sure.
<s> The contract was stolen.
<s> I know.  It was a joke.
<s> Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
<s> If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
<s> What do you want to know?
<s> Jesus -- why?
<s> You were like a boy genius?
<s> The exotic women.
<s> They tried to kill you?
<s> Tell me about the first time.
<s> He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
<s> Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
<s> It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
<s> So?
<s> Jesus, if someone had --
<s> Why?
<s> She was taken.
<s> No.
<s> I'm not normal.
<s> Right.
<s> Oh, God.  I see it!
<s> God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
<s> Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
<s> How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
<s> I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
<s> All the time.
<s> Do you believe that?
<s> It's possible.
<s> A dime.
<s> Average.
<s> I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't that funny?  I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one.
<s> Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
<s> It won't last, believe me. And you, when will you go back to the States?
<s> Yeah, group bloody therapy time.
<s> An alternative literary venue!
<s> Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
<s> So?
<s> Thought of everything haven't you.
<s> You're nuts man, Katka's right!
<s> No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
<s> No....The Asylum!
<s> Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
<s> You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
<s> He got that one right.
<s> Doug?
<s> That's my mum's.
<s> No!
<s> Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
<s> Yeah, maybe.
<s> Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
<s> Look Kat it'll only take ten minutes. Without Jahn I might never find it... We'll just have a quick look and then you and I'll hit a tram.
<s> I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
<s> It's bad news when you can't even bribe kids.
<s> I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
<s> No, it's not true, you're lying.
<s> Great. And your all set for the performance?
<s> Great....How long will it go for?
<s> Ah, so what?
<s> A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
<s> What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
<s> What is bail?
<s> Hmm, I still owe him.
<s> It's Josh's.
<s> Working....Under cover.
<s> A drill, what are you up to?
<s> You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
<s> No way, he even gave me back pay.
<s> Maybe it is!
<s> Well come on, sit down.
<s> Yes, if you can get him free.
<s> In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
<s> That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
<s> Very well.
<s> I don't want his money.
<s> That's over. Way over.
<s> Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
<s> Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
<s> I didn't know either.
<s> Landon --
<s> Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --
<s> Landon, honey. There's nothing more.
<s> It was.
<s> Later.
<s> -- I know you don't suck at acting.
<s> Like me.
<s> Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
<s> The dirty snowball at its core.
<s> In 76 years, me neither.
<s> My relationship with God is my own.
<s> Yeah --
<s> Thank you. So were you.
<s> Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
<s> Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
<s> Where?
<s> No. Why? Are you seducible?
<s> That was read at my parents' wedding.
<s> Because you have hope that you'll get better?
<s> Yes.
<s> Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
<s> Yes.
<s> I want to come back.
<s> I'd do that --
<s> Then you remember more than I do.
<s> -- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> Uh, yes, sir...
<s> I was practicing. I've got an audition next week -- I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?
<s> Uh, hi....
<s> No!
<s> Good.
<s> Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker.
<s> Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
<s> Not now....
<s> Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
<s> Bic... It's a Bic pen.
<s> I'm going to be at the dance.
<s> In the parking lot, with her.
<s> Not a holocaust --
<s> All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
<s> Operator, what's today's date?
<s> What's this all about?
<s> Yeah,  Right.
<s> Pro! Release the rope!
<s> Shhhhhhhh!
<s> Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
<s> The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp?!
<s> Is Shemp all right?
<s> You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
<s> The power converter...
<s> We don't....
<s> Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
<s> Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed...  I'd stick out like a sore thumb.
<s> But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
<s> Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
<s> But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
<s> Not bad.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Mmmmm.
<s> You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
<s> What's your friend's name?
<s> Holly.
<s> What for?
<s> Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
<s> What?
<s> There you go.
<s> Great.
<s> Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
<s> There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
<s> What?
<s> You don't believe me, see for yourself.
<s> Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
<s> He didn't say anything to me about it.
<s> Just looking.
<s> Excuse me.
<s> I don't blame him.
<s> Really?
<s> Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.
<s> Have you warned Professor Hikita?
<s> And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
<s> Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...
<s> Just 'grazed' you, huh?
<s> Let her out. In my custody.
<s> Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
<s> What is it, Tommy?
<s> Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.
<s> Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
<s> No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
<s> What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
<s> What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
<s> Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
<s> You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.
<s> Asshole probably got lost.
<s> He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
<s> Yes I am. I'm working on a wres  please call me Barton.
<s> Please, Barton.
<s> Hello.
<s> Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
<s> Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
<s> Garland, it's me.
<s> All right, forget the heads. Where's Mundt, Fink?
<s> I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
<s> Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
<s> You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
<s> I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
<s> Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York  hopefully our numbers are growing  who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths  not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
<s> I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
<s> I can feel my butt getting sore already.
<s> Charlie. How are you.
<s> Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet  what happened to your ear?
<s> Not at all. It's damned interesting.
<s> That's all right, really 
<s> Seems like nothing but, lately.
<s> Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started  I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me  my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
<s> Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
<s> No... Can I come in?
<s> We gotta call the police 
<s> Lou.
<s> KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
<s> Mr. Lipnik.
<s> You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink  you're a goddamn write-off.
<s> Huh?
<s> The others are being sent.
<s> Nine days  Tuesday 
<s> You're a sick fuck, Fink.
<s> His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
<s> Anyway.
<s> Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it.  He'll get into the swing of things or I don't know writers. Let's make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. We don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling, but since you're Barton Fink I'm assuming you have it in spades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. We're off to a good start. Dammit, if all our writers were like you I wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
<s> Look at "Blood, Sweat, and Canvas". These are big movies, Fink. About big men, in tights  both physically and mentally. But especially physically. We don't put Wallace Beery in some fruity movie about suffering  I thought we were together on that.
<s> When did you start drinking again?
<s> Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi.
<s> Did you find out about her parents?
<s> Thanks.
<s> Bring 1976 up.
<s> It's been three months.
<s> No.  I mean it, thank you.
<s> Yes.
<s> Only when they make interesting reading.
<s> I loved him.  I hurt.
<s> You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
<s> You see?  We're both innocent, Nick.
<s> She wiped out her whole family.
<s> Don't get too cocky.
<s> No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
<s> I'll risk it.
<s> For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
<s> You paid $50,000 for your character?
<s> I had sex with him for about a year and a half.  I liked having sex with him.
<s> Nilsen?
<s> She misses me.
<s> I know what that's like.
<s> You don't like punk rockers?
<s> Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else.  How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.
<s> I don't believe it.
<s> You're my friend, Gus.
<s> Which one you talkin' about now, son?  We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
<s> He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
<s> I'm going with you.
<s> Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
<s> Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
<s> Yeah.  I know.
<s> Go stick your head in a tub of ice water.  See where she leads.
<s> Is he dead?
<s> What was it?
<s> Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
<s> Fuck you, too Nick.
<s> Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
<s> You don't but it, do you?  She knew nobody would but it.  She knew I'd say she did it.  And she knew nobody would buy it.
<s> Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
<s> I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
<s> The whole thing  painting.
<s> Saddle River's in New Jersey.
<s> My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Well, have you asked her to come back?
<s> I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
<s> I don't like beer.
<s> You haven't been by lately.
<s> You name it, I paint there.
<s> Sure, ok..
<s> I'm here.
<s> You're not?
<s> Chateau Latour '64, please.
<s> Use your fucking instinct.
<s> The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic  writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..
<s> Oh  you mean black people!
<s> Who's John Henry?
<s> Good. What do you have?
<s> I guess it was a long time ago.
<s> Can I walk you home?
<s> I do.  I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.
<s> You want some?
<s> You're your own baby.
<s> George?
<s> You only want one Big Mac?
<s> Can you put me in the ring with him?
<s> Fuck...  I forgot about that.
<s> What time is it?
<s> I just don't think you're being fair.
<s> I need this?
<s> Hanging on every word.
<s> Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
<s> We do.
<s> I tried to grab you -- save you --
<s> Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
<s> I'm tempted.
<s> Yeah?  Me too...
<s> Had one.  Didn't work.
<s> Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
<s> Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
<s> Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
<s> He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
<s> Fred.  Fred?  He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --
<s> Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
<s> As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.
<s> In spirit only, I'm afraid.
<s> Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
<s> What seems to be the problem?
<s> I recognized the accent.
<s> Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
<s> My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  Alfred has been supporting me ever since.
<s> You'd be surprised.
<s> Alfred and Bruce are like family.
<s> Divide and conquer.
<s> The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
<s> He'll be here.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
<s> Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
<s> I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
<s> Can I get some help over here?
<s> I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
<s> What?
<s> Well...um...her.
<s> Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
<s> You left your back wide open.  Freeze could have killed you.
<s> Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
<s> I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
<s> I find that unlikely.
<s> You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
<s> At you?  Polly want a kiss?
<s> She has an excellent mind.
<s> I wonder if she'd go out with me.
<s> I shall be near at hand. Should you need me. And sir, I know it's difficult but try and have a good time.
<s> Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
<s> How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
<s> Just checking, young sir.
<s> We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
<s> Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
<s> Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
<s> Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
<s> You understand obsession better than you let on.
<s> Well, I met someone...
<s> You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
<s> What?
<s> And now....
<s> Why do I feel like the other man, here?
<s> I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
<s> What?
<s> You do know. Try.
<s> Excuse me.
<s> Bruce, you can't.
<s> Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?
<s> Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?
<s> Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.
<s> You sunk my battleship.
<s> Thank you, Alfred.  I hope you'll excuse me.  It was a great pleasure meeting you.  And you.
<s> WHICH CAR?
<s> I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
<s> Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
<s> That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
<s> Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
<s> In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
<s> I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.
<s> I wish you'd...
<s> No one would miss me.
<s> You're one man. You can't save everybody.
<s> The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
<s> ... Where are you calling from?
<s> Take 'em! I want his head!
<s> Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
<s> Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
<s> Because I want someone I can trust.
<s> JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
<s> Alicia!  Come here, have a seat.  Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
<s> Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
<s> God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
<s> Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.
<s> Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
<s> It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.
<s> Hi.....  Roses.
<s> Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
<s> Uh ... yes ...
<s> Ahm.....
<s> Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
<s> And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> Okay, sir.  Certainly.  Good.
<s> I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
<s> Yes, this is Doctor Bean.
<s> I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
<s> Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.  No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
<s> Great, good.
<s> That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
<s> I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?
<s> Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
<s> Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
<s> Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
<s> Huh huh huh.
<s> Huh huh. No way, dude.
<s> This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
<s> Uh, probably like, another five minutes or something.
<s> Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...
<s> Yeah! Boobs. Heh heh. I just wanna say that again. Boobs. Heh heh.
<s> Uh, oh yeah. Cool. They can take us to Washington and we can finally score.
<s> Butt-dumpling...
<s> Yer late.
<s> Just make sure it looks like an accident...
<s> Yeah, we're gonna score.
<s> Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
<s> You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
<s> OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
<s> Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
<s> Well sir, I didn't really think it was necessary. You see we have a picture of them from the elevator security cam. Here, have a look.
<s> Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
<s> Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
<s> Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
<s> Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
<s> Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
<s> Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
<s> Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
<s> No, Jane.
<s> Two hours.
<s> That's my girl!
<s> They make gypsies look good.
<s> I don't know if there's anything we can do.
<s> Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
<s> We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
<s> Draw door?  I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
<s> Wait.
<s> I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
<s> The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
<s> All right.
<s> We're ghosts.
<s> Really.  I don't know.
<s> I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
<s> Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
<s> Now, let's get rolling!
<s> We have to start simpler, is that it?
<s> <u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
<s> Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
<s> And live in what, our station wagon?
<s> They're dead.
<s> I think so.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No, dummy.  Two.
<s> Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
<s> Just <u>say</u> it.
<s> He's a cloven-hooved beast!
<s> Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
<s> Why not?
<s> Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
<s> Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
<s> No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
<s> It wasn't a joke.
<s> I thought I saw something.
<s> That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
<s> She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
<s> That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!
<s> I understand. I've seen it done before.
<s> I see.
<s> Yes, I will.
<s> Yes, Robert. I will.
<s> Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
<s> How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
<s> In a day or two, yes.
<s> Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
<s> I have no idea...
<s> I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Oh, yes.
<s> Your family doctor?
<s> Oh? Certainly...
<s> No. I'm a gardener.
<s> No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
<s> He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
<s> Our greenhouse.
<s> Thank you, Eve.
<s> Yes, Eve. I know that.
<s> Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
<s> Yes. I like to watch.
<s> Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
<s> Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
<s> Yes, very well, thank you.
<s> Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
<s> I see. I would like to work in your garden.
<s> ... Oh?  Robert, take a look, would you?
<s> You're looking much better today, Ben.
<s> Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
<s> I want to tell Eve.
<s> Yes.
<s> How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...
<s> Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
<s> Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
<s> Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
<s> You're welcome.
<s> I hope so.
<s> No. I don't object.
<s> Yes. I was there with Ben.
<s> Yes, Thomas - I understand.
<s> Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.
<s> No.
<s> ... Hello.
<s> ... Nothing.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
<s> I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...
<s> ... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
<s> Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
<s> Gardiner, yes, sir.
<s> Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
<s> Good. Anything else?
<s> Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
<s> Yes, I did.
<s> Take care of yourself, Ben.
<s> Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
<s> Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
<s> The monkey.
<s> I... puppeteer.
<s> Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
<s> Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.
<s> Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
<s> Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
<s> Don't crowd me, Craig.
<s> You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
<s> What?
<s> Me and John.
<s> I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
<s> Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
<s> What's that?
<s> Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
<s> I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
<s> He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?
<s> Holy shit, yes!
<s> Holy shit! He said what I said!
<s> It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
<s> I'll keep that in mind, sir.
<s> Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
<s> No, really.
<s> Maxine.
<s> My tits?
<s> I'll protect you, Dollface.
<s> I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
<s> Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
<s> Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
<s> Hello. Wendy.
<s> Hush, sweetheart.
<s> Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
<s> Can I be anyone I want?
<s> Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
<s> Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
<s> No.
<s> Oh, Lotte...
<s> Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
<s> No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
<s> Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
<s> Derek Mantini!
<s> I'm saying they came into my yard.
<s> Not like He punished me.
<s> WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
<s> WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
<s> NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING.
<s> Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
<s> We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
<s> Yes?
<s> I don't. I have my own.
<s> I miss her.
<s> Work? Start learnin your letters again?
<s> Well, what can you do?
<s> I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
<s> Might see anything at all at 124.
<s> He's sleeping in the church.
<s> Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
<s> Her who?
<s> Just me.
<s> Never found out.
<s> It ain't what you think.
<s> Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
<s> Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
<s> Yes sir..You right about that. That's just what I come over to talk to him about. Just that..
<s> I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.
<s> And this guy peed on it.
<s> I am the Walrus.
<s> That fucking bitch!
<s> Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
<s> Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
<s> WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!
<s> They were Nazis, Dude?
<s> You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--
<s> I pull over and kick your ass out, man!
<s> Hey, is this him with Nancy?
<s> Lebowski on the right?
<s> Jeez.  Think he's got room for one more?
<s> ...Also, my rug was stolen.
<s> And the, uh, the briefcase?
<s> What's your drink, Dude?
<s> But she hasn't run off, she's been--
<s> Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.
<s> Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
<s> Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a good man, and thorough.
<s> Is he pretending to be the abductor?
<s> So Dieter has the money?
<s> Do you still have that doctor's number?
<s> What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
<s> First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
<s> MARK IT ZERO!
<s> You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
<s> Huh?
<s> Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
<s> My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?
<s> What the fuck is going on there?
<s> Easy, Dude.
<s> Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
<s> Walter, please--
<s> That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--
<s> Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
<s> Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
<s> The nail polish, Walter.
<s> They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
<s> And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
<s> All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
<s> Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny.
<s> Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
<s> Is the car out front yours?
<s> Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
<s> What's your point, Dude?
<s> I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
<s> Walter--
<s> Dude, I'm sorry--
<s> So no funny stuff.  Okay?
<s> You are approaching a vooden britch. When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch you.
<s> Well. . . yeah.
<s> This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules.
<s> Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
<s> It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
<s> Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
<s> It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?
<s> Then who does he work for?
<s> Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
<s> Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
<s> Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
<s> Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
<s> Don't even start, old man.
<s> Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
<s> I don't buy it.
<s> How do I stop it?
<s> What do you see here?
<s> Look closer.
<s> Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
<s> You get used to the darkness.
<s> Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
<s> Cancer.
<s> I was afraid that might happen.
<s> You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.
<s> Then what is it?
<s> What?
<s> You're wrong, Dragonetti.
<s> Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
<s> Perhaps.
<s> You.
<s> Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
<s> Hey, folklore--
<s> I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
<s> --my God, Nick???
<s> To stand up--I'm exhausted. Been on the road since yesterday.
<s> Mrs. Leavitt--
<s> Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
<s> Not the only things missing, Nick.
<s> Oh, sorry, right.
<s> She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--
<s> Get your goddamn--
<s> What?
<s> I can't.
<s> --no, what's wrong with you?
<s> Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
<s> Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
<s> I do.
<s> Butt-ugly owl.
<s> Still don't see it--
<s> Don't have one.
<s> Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
<s> --anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
<s> No idea--goddamitt!
<s> --I saw what I saw.
<s> --hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
<s> --who?
<s> What?
<s> Spite.
<s> --oh, Jesus--
<s> No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.
<s> Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
<s> I thought the movie was bitchin'.
<s> At least you still have the tapes.
<s> Then I have no idea.
<s> It touched me, don't you see it now?
<s> Sure. I'm sorry.
<s> Whatever.
<s> That feels good. Lower--down into my neck.
<s> --why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
<s> Or a blood blister--or a bruise.
<s> Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
<s> Anna--
<s> Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
<s> His daughter, for God's sake-- I need to know if he's heard from her this morning.
<s> I don't know, he didn't say anything.
<s> Door's locked. Nothing there.
<s> I couldn't believe it either...
<s> You're bad.
<s> Ray--
<s> ...What was that?
<s> Isn't that what you want?
<s> What do you want to know?
<s> Thanks.
<s> Going out with Meurice.
<s> I'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years.
<s> See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
<s> No.
<s> Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
<s> Got a job for you.
<s> I want you to go fishing.
<s> Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.
<s> How would I know?
<s> Right.
<s> What.
<s> Meurice...
<s> We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty.
<s> You shouldn't have taken the money...
<s> Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
<s> Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
<s> Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
<s> You did? A human ear?
<s> I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
<s> Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
<s> It's blue. blue velvet.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No. not at all.
<s> Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
<s> Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
<s> . my bourbon.
<s> Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.
<s> Then you got undressed.
<s> Never before this.
<s> I . I don't know.
<s> No. please. I won't.
<s> O.K.
<s> There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
<s> Hello.
<s> I'm doing it.
<s> Yes.
<s> Just get outta my bed.
<s> I did. are you?
<s> Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
<s> Go where?
<s> Yeah. What are you doing now?
<s> That's too bad.
<s> No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts.
<s> I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
<s> Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
<s> Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
<s> Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
<s> First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
<s> Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
<s> First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
<s> Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean?
<s> He got a little jealous.
<s> That doesn't bother you, does it?
<s> Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
<s> I will.  I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
<s> You better not, Jeffrey.
<s> That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
<s> No.
<s> ... You look beautiful.
<s> No.
<s> uh uh.
<s> It's good to see you, Dad.
<s> Jeffrey, when you see your father.
<s> I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.
<s> Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
<s> Yeah.
<s> That sounds great!
<s> Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
<s> What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
<s> Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
<s> You happy, baby?
<s> Yeah, I don't feel so well.
<s> Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us.
<s> What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
<s> My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
<s> You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
<s> Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.
<s> It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
<s> Nice doing business with you, George.
<s> For calling you a homo.
<s> I don't want to talk about it.
<s> I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.
<s> Because I got caught.
<s> We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
<s> I just got released five minutes ago.
<s> Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The water.  The women.  It's better than Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some friends I would like you to meet.
<s> We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.
<s> And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
<s> But to the victor belong the spoils.
<s> What the fuck is going on?  When did you get out of jail?
<s> We're half a million off.
<s> You're a lucky man, Diego.
<s> I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What happened to our dream?
<s> No more brothers, Diego.
<s> You, you big old tightwad.  He still has his communion money.  Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.
<s> It would be my pleasure.
<s> Un sapo?
<s> Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.
<s> Power?
<s> Family.
<s> Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
<s> Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
<s> Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
<s> That was a good one, Dad.  That was really something.  Remember that?
<s> Tuna.
<s> The set-up is wrong.  We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail.  We're getting middled.
<s> Hello.
<s> Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
<s> Yeah, you will.  Of course.
<s> Are we gonna split up?
<s> Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
<s> Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
<s> Yeah.
<s> California.
<s> Okay, George.
<s> We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's lockdown time.
<s> Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.
<s> All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
<s> This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
<s> When there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....
<s> What?
<s> Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available.  Nothing good, anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit.
<s> Don't be such a pussy.
<s> The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
<s> Sail.
<s> Then don't complain.
<s> With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
<s> It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
<s> Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case?
<s> Cause?
<s> Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene?
<s> Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
<s> Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony.
<s> You may call your next witness.
<s> Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.
<s> Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
<s> She left me.
<s> Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that...
<s> It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
<s> No.
<s> And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
<s> We dated for about a month last year.
<s> While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> No!  Why would I want to kill him?
<s> Then you would have gotten your money?
<s> I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
<s> Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
<s> We're not animals.
<s> Sure.  Where to?
<s> It's not my taste.
<s> Not true.  Shall I tell you what you were thinking?  You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt.
<s> Hi.  It's Frank.
<s> It won't be that hard.
<s> I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
<s> You can see me now.
<s> You're a monster.
<s> I love you too, Dad.
<s> That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
<s> Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
<s> I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
<s> Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
<s> That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
<s> Where have you been?
<s> That's too bad.
<s> Well, no one in my family did! Dad bought cemetery plots at Oak Ridge. One for him, one for mom.
<s> Doesn't matter. Move on.
<s> I said NO!
<s> Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
<s> Well, what am I supposed to think?
<s> Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose.  But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..."
<s> No. We're going to lock this up and --
<s> And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
<s> Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
<s> I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
<s> Did we want to?
<s> You're right -- that is sick.
<s> No, what?
<s> No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
<s> No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait.  I just have to get my shoes.
<s> You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
<s> Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
<s> Want another cigarette?
<s> I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
<s> Clean?
<s> And clean.
<s> I feel so embarrassed.
<s> I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
<s> I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
<s> You get used to it.
<s> No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
<s> No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
<s> Yes! Hi.
<s> The light was fading. Huh-huh.
<s> I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage.  Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or... 
<s> Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
<s> No, I don't mind.
<s> You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
<s> No.
<s> For who?
<s> The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
<s> I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
<s> Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
<s> I can't sleep.
<s> I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
<s> What happened?
<s> I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
<s> Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
<s> Then what do you care?
<s> Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
<s> Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
<s> The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
<s> Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be buggin' from hanging with you.
<s> What the hell you talking about?
<s> Climb out to where?
<s> That's some terrible shit.
<s> Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
<s> Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
<s> I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.
<s> Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
<s> What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
<s> Fuck it.  Alright.
<s> Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
<s> Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
<s> Or you didn't know what to do with it.
<s> Yeah, you heard of him?
<s> Potential toxic dump site.
<s> You want to get into this now?
<s> I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
<s> Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
<s> Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
<s> Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
<s> Why?  'Cause you know him?
<s> There's no time.
<s> What are you, drunk?
<s> The hell I can't!
<s> Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
<s> Caesar ...
<s> Just hurry.
<s> They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
<s> I should have let him kill you.
<s> Oh, right.
<s> Five.
<s> I should be going.
<s> Hey, Mickey.
<s> Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
<s> Leave your phone on the hook.
<s> This is the police, ma'am.
<s> ...  thank you.
<s> I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
<s> No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
<s> Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."
<s> I think so, too.
<s> Is that what you think?
<s> Johnnie?
<s> It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
<s> ...  shit.
<s> Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
<s> Poor boy, has to work so hard.
<s> If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
<s> That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
<s> Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
<s> Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
<s> Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
<s> Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
<s> ...which one are you?...
<s> ...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
<s> Right.
<s> One moment, sir.
<s> ...I understand...
<s> I hadn't heard.
<s> I want to go home.
<s> You have blood on your pants.
<s> You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
<s> Then I'll find another ride.
<s> I know that.
<s> Where are we?
<s> I dream I'm asleep.  I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up.  I don't think I smoke.
<s> Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
<s> ...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
<s> -- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
<s> No.
<s> You could do that?
<s> xxxxxx
<s> What?
<s> -- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
<s> You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- 
<s> Hang on... 
<s> Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
<s> I told you.  You need to rest.
<s> I won't forget this.
<s> I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
<s> He's tampered with it, Dowser.
<s> Mumble ... Tuttle ...
<s> You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
<s> ... new washer.
<s> Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
<s> What? You mean you've got ...
<s> Her name is Jill.
<s> Beginner's luck.
<s> Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
<s> SAM! What a surprise!
<s> Yes, thanks.
<s> I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
<s> You killed him?
<s> I'm sure you have
<s> Very smart.
<s> Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
<s> What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
<s> You're the only person I can trust.
<s> But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
<s> We don't make mistakes.
<s> I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
<s> I do. Goodbye. 
<s> What?
<s> Don't look back! Act naturally!
<s> I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
<s> It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
<s> Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's only my first day.
<s> Stop it ... damn you!
<s> "And your children all gone."
<s> Oh ... Jesus!
<s> Yes.
<s> C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
<s> Take care.
<s> You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead.
<s> I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
<s> Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
<s> Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself. 
<s> She didn't say anything about it to me.
<s> I'm sorry but ...
<s> Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
<s> He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
<s> There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
<s> Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
<s> No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
<s> I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
<s> It's all right, Terry, it's all right, everything's all right.
<s> Why not? All you've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, haven't you?
<s> But ... I called Central Services.
<s> Are you saying this is illegal?
<s> The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
<s> I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
<s> You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
<s> No ...
<s> Mary said you might be coming.
<s> He's going to be all right, right?
<s> You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
<s> John, play the Sinatra.
<s> His heart's beating.
<s> You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
<s> We moved out after that. Upstate.
<s> I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
<s> Fifteen minutes.
<s> There's no time.
<s> Make a left here. I want to stop.
<s> She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
<s> Here's to the greatest job in the world.
<s> I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.  Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.
<s> No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular off and on, hasn't been in in a while. He seized and almost coded--I gave him a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. One for the textbooks.
<s> Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity.
<s> How many times have you shocked him tonight?
<s> Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
<s> Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
<s> Who with?
<s> What do you want to break?
<s> He's crazy. He can't help it.
<s> Okay, whatta I do?
<s> No shit.
<s> I'm not hungry.
<s> It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.
<s> It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
<s> You sure?
<s> You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
<s> And the rule was...
<s> It's not loaded.
<s> No?
<s> They booted me out of Washington.
<s> I'll see you back at the hotel.
<s> Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
<s> Why?
<s> Ravenous homosexual.
<s> At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
<s> You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
<s> Did you shoot their boots?
<s> Good.
<s> They're not that dumb, after all.
<s> Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
<s> No.
<s> It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
<s> I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
<s> This isn't friendship.
<s> No.  You know that I'm not.
<s> Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
<s> Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you.  How do you like that? -- I buried the lead.
<s> I hope so...  No.  I'm not really mad.  I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay?
<s> Well -- my wife got this new job...
<s> I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
<s> Outside?
<s> No.
<s> What is she shooting?
<s> Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
<s> Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
<s> No stop where he's all besieged.
<s> Bobbie, please.
<s> Bad manners.
<s> I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
<s> Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
<s> My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you.
<s> Nobody else had it.
<s> Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
<s> Oh.
<s> Okay, sweetie.
<s> Honey?...
<s> I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
<s> No.  Not even you.
<s> No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
<s> No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
<s> Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
<s> It's not.
<s> Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
<s> Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
<s> Oh, good.
<s> It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
<s> I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
<s> Where are you?
<s> No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
<s> Yes.
<s> Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh?  Good night.
<s> Why did I have to do this to myself?  Watch you take off.  Call me if you need anything.
<s> A picnic?
<s> I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
<s> Right back to you.
<s> I didn't finish talking to you!
<s> N-no...
<s> I already told you I'm not.
<s> Um...
<s> What!
<s> Anything new?
<s> Murdered man.
<s> Yeah it was all just an accident.
<s> It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
<s> It wasn't easy.
<s> Now you're a professional!
<s> Yeah.  Can some of you guys help me?
<s> Here here...
<s> Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
<s> What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
<s> Leonard, what are you doing?
<s> I do the research.
<s> I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
<s> Yeah, right outside the door!
<s> Well it sure looks dead enough.
<s> I didn't mean to.
<s> I-I already got a new one!
<s> I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.
<s> These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...
<s> Just wait till you see this!
<s> Excuse me I have to make a call...
<s> Can't you see I'm busy here?
<s> Hm.
<s> Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?  You sure you don't want a pancake?
<s> I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
<s> Turn around!
<s> Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.
<s> Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
<s> Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.
<s> No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.
<s> I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
<s> Let's move out!
<s> Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
<s> Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
<s> Let me in.
<s> My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
<s> Uum... around ten?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
<s> Didn't you get my message?
<s> Water.  Okay.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
<s> I'll back that up.
<s> Yeah?
<s> You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
<s> Pretty shallow of you.
<s> Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
<s> 'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
<s> See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.
<s> Nice ensemble!
<s> Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
<s> I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
<s> Wait!
<s> You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
<s> Yes.
<s> In Virginia.
<s> All right.
<s> Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
<s> Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
<s> Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
<s> It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
<s> Buffy...
<s> I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
<s> You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
<s> That's the plan.
<s> What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
<s> Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
<s> You're having a fling with him?
<s> My parents have money...
<s> Really?
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Could be.
<s> But --
<s> Okay.
<s> Buffy?
<s> Nee sitch.  No way.
<s> Does Jeffrey know?
<s> Right!
<s> Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
<s> As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?
<s> You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
<s> Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
<s> Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
<s> Much better.  Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me.  This is progress.
<s> Get over here.
<s> No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
<s> Yes I do...
<s> So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to talk--
<s> Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
<s> "I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
<s> What do you believe in?
<s> I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
<s> Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
<s> Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
<s> He won't make love to me anymore.
<s> I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
<s> I said when I think about you, I get wet.
<s> He looks great, just great!
<s> Ninety-five miles an hour...
<s> That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
<s> You got a live arm there.
<s> Well shit, then, let's fuck.
<s> If you believe in Voodoo.
<s> It was a cocksucking call!
<s> Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
<s> But he ain't seen my heat--
<s> 'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
<s> I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
<s> By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
<s> The moment's over.  If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, I'm going downtown--
<s> It's time you started working on your interviews.
<s> Love to--
<s> C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh.  C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--
<s> Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
<s> Jim looking for somebody.
<s> Where does he go?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Why are you doing this to me?
<s> Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
<s> Was I at that dinner?
<s> I was in the building!
<s> On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
<s> But what happens when they do find out?
<s> It's a pity in this...
<s> They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
<s> Excuse me.
<s> You fuckin' piece of shit.
<s> Lester...
<s> Right back.
<s> You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
<s> Ginger.
<s> Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
<s> Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
<s> Hey.
<s> Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
<s> What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
<s> I lost control?
<s> Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
<s> No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
<s> Why?
<s> I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
<s> No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
<s> Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
<s> I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.
<s> Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
<s> I'll come by.
<s> Seven o'clock.
<s> ...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
<s> No, Ace.
<s> That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
<s> I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
<s> L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
<s> What is it?
<s> No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
<s> Thanks a lot.
<s> Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you.  Want to take a chance?
<s> I'm not crying. 
<s> Yeah. Yeah.
<s> ...they didn't know what really moved her.
<s> Okay.
<s> That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.
<s> ...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
<s> Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here.
<s> I'll go, but I want my money right now!
<s> No kidding. NO KIDDING!
<s> And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
<s> Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
<s> Oh.  I got your cigarettes.
<s> So, who'd you go to lunch with?
<s> And where'd you go?
<s> What'd you have?
<s> You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
<s> Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker!
<s> I am calm!
<s> What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
<s> We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
<s> ...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me -
<s> What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
<s> I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
<s> Can't do it with both hands?
<s> God! 
<s> All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?
<s> I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
<s> Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
<s> Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
<s> Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
<s> Well, I've been busy. 
<s> Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
<s> Hey.
<s> That's not a problem, that's not a p-
<s> Mr Rothstein, why don't we just let her in the house and get a few of her things?  That way she'll get out of here. This is half her house anyway.
<s> Nicky, I did -
<s> Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
<s> Fuckers!
<s> Oh.
<s> Calm down! Calm down!
<s> For what?
<s> I know.
<s> What're you gonna do?
<s> Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
<s> No. I ain't see anything like that.
<s> Am I right?
<s> You're so nice. 
<s> Nothin'.
<s> I don't - 
<s> All right. Be careful.
<s> That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
<s> Get lost?
<s> Get lost?
<s> Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
<s> You are.
<s> Okay, then.
<s> Lester - he called you here.
<s> So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
<s> I think that's it.
<s> You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
<s> She asleep?
<s> Pleasure.
<s> But he never talked.
<s> But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back.
<s> Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
<s> Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?
<s> Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
<s> Dominick said they're in the motel?
<s> Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
<s> Hey.
<s> Denying?
<s> Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
<s> You are right. What can I...
<s> Yeah.
<s> You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
<s> I don't know. I can't remember.
<s> Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
<s> What did you say?  Selina, sit down, the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...
<s> Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very...  This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..
<s> It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
<s> Oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going...
<s> I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
<s> Wha-at?
<s> Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?
<s> I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
<s> You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
<s> Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...
<s> That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
<s> Why am I still troubled...
<s> I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
<s> Just like a woman. You want out. You're out.
<s> I know, I should probably tell you, but I just don't feel like it. To be honest, I'm really angry at you. I admired you so much more when you were purely wicked. I mean, look at you now, running around trying to "get to the bottom" of things. Trying to "save the city." It's true we're about to do a very nasty deed, but really, what's it to you?  Since when do you care what happens to a bunch of pathetic Oasiburgians? You're just not yourself, anymore.
<s> You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
<s> Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
<s> What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?
<s> But of course you are.
<s> I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
<s> I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine...
<s> Not too cool...
<s> Okay. Let's get serious. Of course I know the Cult of Good is not good. Ever since I saw what they did in Atlanta, it has been my mission to expose them. I've followed them to Oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. That computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. This isn't just a story, Selina--another damn Pulitzer--this is my life.
<s> I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Theo wants to talk again.
<s> See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
<s> I'm the one they'd be looking for.
<s> With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
<s> That's what I deserve for listening in the first place.
<s> Sure -- and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
<s> I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
<s> Allow me.
<s> I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
<s> I was worried about you.  Both of you.
<s> They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
<s> My name is --
<s> They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
<s> I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
<s> He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
<s> Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick.
<s> I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn.
<s> Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
<s> What about the others?
<s> I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
<s> I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
<s> Pictures.
<s> They say my work is somewhat derivative.
<s> That's not her.
<s> It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
<s> It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
<s> Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
<s> No.
<s> Lucky for them they didn't.
<s> That's coming off.  How about the girl?
<s> Put the man back on.
<s> Include me in that.
<s> As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
<s> Why pick me to be your "mark?"
<s> I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
<s> The money, Nels ... ?
<s> That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
<s> Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
<s> He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
<s> Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
<s> Didn't we play this scene before?
<s> I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
<s> You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
<s> I wish it had never been invented.
<s> You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
<s> In your dreams.
<s> Are you busting my chops or what?
<s> Stay put!  I know my way around.
<s> Them.  They won't be expecting us.
<s> Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
<s> Yeah?
<s> What would you call it?
<s> What do you think his name is?
<s> Hi, Jimmy.
<s> An excellent quality.
<s> I would expect he does.
<s> Did I?
<s> Don't throw my clothes out the window!
<s> Scottish?
<s> Not me.
<s> Hi. You forgot your bag.
<s> They all get the wrong idea.
<s> You know.
<s> God no. I'm a hairdresser.
<s> No, I didn't --
<s> Like what?
<s> How special?
<s> Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
<s> Tried to. Sit down, will you?
<s> Shouldn't I go?
<s> Like you're concerned.
<s> Something I heard someone say once.
<s> Make it up to me, then.
<s> Know what, honey?
<s> You can always pretend.
<s> Stop it, Jimmy.
<s> He'd bring me carnations.
<s> Why, honey --
<s> Anything.
<s> Afraid so.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I'm going home!
<s> I was trying to get out of something.
<s> Jimmy?
<s> Did you hear me?
<s> Whatever you say, Dil.
<s> It's my name, Dil --
<s> And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
<s> Please, Dil --
<s> Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
<s> Need to go across the water.
<s> Fucking do. I had him all over me.
<s> I know.
<s> Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
<s> Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
<s> And what happens then?
<s> Thanks.
<s> Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight --
<s> I'm sure.
<s> Aye, I do, Peter.
<s> Yeah.
<s> My pleasure.
<s> Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
<s> What is it now?
<s> You want to bet?
<s> And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
<s> Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
<s> My pleasure, Jody
<s> Yeah?
<s> Don't be so sure.
<s> It's as simple as that?
<s> How can I?
<s> Why?
<s> Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
<s> You don't know me, do you?
<s> You didn't?
<s> Tell me, Jody
<s> The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
<s> First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!
<s> Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
<s> Why?
<s> Then who did? You're the only one left.
<s> You mean spies and things like that?
<s> We? You mean you're --?
<s> Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
<s> Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!
<s> No.
<s> Oh. Then who's this one?
<s> Me? Why me?
<s> The last one, please.
<s> No.
<s> And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
<s> Yes, but we're divorced.
<s> There, you said it.
<s> Okay.
<s> Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt.
<s> No.
<s> Why?
<s> First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
<s> Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
<s> I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
<s> No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
<s> You know I'd tell you if I had it.
<s> Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
<s> I don't know anything.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Is that all? Can I go now?
<s> -- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
<s> We won! We won!
<s> I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
<s> Quitter.
<s> That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
<s> Charles sold it all -- at auction.
<s> Don't you understand French?
<s> Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
<s> That's all.
<s> What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
<s> Don't put yourself out.
<s> Please stop -- please!
<s> Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old. Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute?
<s> I've never seen him before.
<s> I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.
<s> What's the matter, chrie?
<s> Not my imports.
<s> I just wanted to check that you were okay?
<s> What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.
<s> It won't happen again.
<s> How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
<s> What's wrong?
<s> It can't be.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
<s> She works at a church?
<s> No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
<s> Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
<s> I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.
<s> You know about that too?
<s> You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
<s> You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
<s> The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
<s> What?
<s> What party?
<s> Everyone's getting ready for the party.
<s> So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
<s> I did.
<s> Yeah. I think it's really sick.
<s> My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
<s> I love you.
<s> Yeah. Who is she?
<s> Yes. Unfair to me.
<s> Okay, okay.
<s> ...shit.
<s> ...-ty.
<s> ...Darlene pay you in cash?
<s> Andy.  Another fuckin'...
<s> He could've.  That-That's true.  But that would've been smart...
<s> That'll make up the difference, huh?
<s> Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that.
<s> I need your help.
<s> Peace.
<s> I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
<s> ...all the time.
<s> 
<s> To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
<s> Fine. 
<s> Okay.
<s>  No...
<s> Hey, take a look at your situation and...
<s>  Yeah...
<s> Well, then, that means it's call...
<s> You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--
<s> Back up!  Back...
<s> All right, you got it.
<s>  Oh...

<s> Whoo!
<s>  I made it.

<s> We're gonna die!

<s>  That's why I didn't give it...
<s> Forty-five seven!
<s> Okay.
<s>  There's gotta be...
<s> Who had to put a gun to your head?
<s> I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...

<s> Yeah.

<s> Hey, be cool.
<s> This country trained me to kill...
<s> ...such is the price...of patriotism.
<s> Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...

<s>   Hey, actually...
<s> What the hell's a sage?
<s> He's the dude...
<s> Thank you.
<s> 
<s> Any of them Richard Long?
<s> It's too...
<s> There's nothing to say, doctor.  Someone had to take the fall, and they still need you, whereas...I've never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side, as you once said.
<s> Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
<s> So far, ye-yes.

<s> No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
<s> If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
<s> I've got her.
<s> She's fine.
<s> Yes... I think I can manage...
<s> No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
<s> Curly, where's your car?
<s> Okay, you got yourself a boat.
<s> I said okay, Jake.
<s> Well you own a lot of land.
<s> Thank you...
<s> Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but -
<s> Who?
<s> You're welcome to try. There he is.
<s> Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
<s> Matter of fact I do.
<s> Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
<s> Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
<s> Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
<s> A private investigator?
<s> Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
<s> Mrs. Mulwray?
<s> I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
<s> Been meaning to talk to you about that.
<s> Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
<s> Of course I'm sure.
<s> What dam?
<s> No.
<s> And Hollis knew about it?
<s> What? What is it?
<s> The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
<s> The police?
<s> Aren't you coming back with me?
<s> What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
<s> She's my sister and my daughter!
<s> To Mexico...
<s> ...so that's why you hate him...
<s> Okay...
<s> He didn't wear bifocals.
<s> But, Mr. Gittes.
<s> Oh no.
<s> You'll find one of those people.
<s> A Miss Sessions calling.
<s> Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.
<s> Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
<s> Maybe he takes it very seriously.
<s> I'm sorry, I --
<s> Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
<s> Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
<s> Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
<s> What about the water?
<s> Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
<s> So how are you, Morty?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Mr. Gittes...
<s> I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
<s> Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
<s> But...
<s> Along with Mr. Mulwray.
<s> Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
<s> Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
<s> But that's what you told your wife.
<s> ...and turn into a piece of charcoal!!
<s> Toto, come here.
<s> Too bad!
<s> Come in, Alfredo.
<s> OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
<s> Progress! It always arrives too late!
<s> What's she like? What's she like?...
<s> I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
<s> Who?
<s> He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.
<s> I can't take shorthand.
<s> I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
<s> You don't really think so?
<s> It didn't end very well, did it?
<s> Who said anything about brooms?
<s> Yes.
<s> Certainly not.
<s> I don't my plans myself.
<s> Because we're running a newspaper, Mr. Kane, not a scandal sheet.
<s> Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
<s> We've got a nice plant here.
<s> It isn't finished?
<s> Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
<s> There aren't any personal lives for people like us.  He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -
<s> Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet -
<s> I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all right.  He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind.
<s> Thanks.
<s> I always like to see the funny side of things.  No sense crying when you don't have to.  And you're so funny.  Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.
<s> No.  But you're close.
<s> You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
<s> You really don't know who I am?
<s> But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
<s> I didn't say.
<s> As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
<s> Half past eleven.
<s> I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
<s> I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
<s> - And left?  Of course they'll hear.  I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.
<s> Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
<s> I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
<s> I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!
<s> Yes, sir. 
<s> What're you going to do, Charlie?
<s> Yes?
<s> I'd like that.
<s> Charlie -
<s> Charlie -
<s> Charlie!
<s> Look out that window.
<s> What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
<s> That's the train with all the lights.
<s> Was he in love?
<s> Sure.
<s> Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.
<s> The Bank's decision in all matters concerning his education, his place of residence and similar subjects will be final. 
<s> We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
<s> Good!
<s> Well, thanks a lot.
<s> I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
<s> It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
<s> Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
<s> Can I join in?
<s> Dante. You've got a customer.
<s> Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
<s> I can't believe you're here.
<s> You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
<s> And you came here to what? To comfort me?
<s> But you were.
<s> If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
<s> There's more, isn't there?
<s> So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
<s> I left like an hour ago.
<s> Like what?
<s> Just me.
<s> Yes.
<s> To the back, above the oil.  How long are you staying?
<s> I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
<s> You called Caitlin again?
<s> She called you Brad?
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> You think things would be any different now?
<s> Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
<s> Return of the Jedi.
<s> Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
<s> All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
<s> He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
<s> You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
<s> The milkmaids?
<s> You've got a customer.
<s> At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
<s> Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
<s> Gatorade.
<s> Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
<s> Balls resting on his lips.
<s> I don't want to talk to you.
<s> Why should I loan you my car?
<s> I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
<s> I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
<s> Five hundred dollars.
<s> I don't; you did.
<s> I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
<s> Because I'm happy.
<s> I'm not.
<s> Watch the store while I go home and change.
<s> This is my way of spitting water at life.
<s> Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
<s> ...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
<s> Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
<s> What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
<s> You need a ride?
<s> I'm her sister.
<s> Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
<s> Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
<s> It's not my store.
<s> So.
<s> No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
<s> So I'm told.
<s> No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
<s> Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
<s> I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
<s> Hunhh? Nothing.
<s> Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
<s> Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
<s> Why? You wanna have sex or something?
<s> Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
<s> I touched a nerve.
<s> It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
<s> These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
<s> Including you?
<s> Three.
<s> We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
<s> All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
<s> Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!
<s> Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
<s> I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
<s> At least he wasn't thirty-six.
<s> Thank you for the lasagne.
<s> Veronica, I love you...
<s> According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
<s> I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.
<s> No way!
<s> That's sick, Dante.
<s> No, I wasn't.
<s> I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
<s> Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
<s> Twenty bucks.
<s> No way, death-breath, that was too intense for thunder.  C'mon let's rock an' roll.
<s> Nothing, just tourist souvenirs.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Hal will have my head for this.
<s> I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
<s> Love's a killer, isn't it?
<s> And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it!
<s> Hi, Gabe.
<s> Is it really four thousand?
<s> Don't say that.  You'll embarrass Frank.
<s> Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
<s> Hal knows what he's doing.
<s> He can handle it.
<s> I only came back for you.
<s> Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
<s> Up ahead.
<s> Next time, date only basketball players.
<s> We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!
<s> I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
<s> We were going together before I ever let go of you.
<s> Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
<s> I won't do it.  No way.
<s> Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
<s> There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
<s> How far?
<s> When he finds the money, you're as dead as me.
<s> Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.
<s> Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.
<s> We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
<s> I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
<s> We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
<s> Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit? Georgie rises.
<s> Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
<s> Won't you join me, sir?
<s> Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
<s> Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
<s> Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
<s> That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
<s> Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
<s> New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
<s> No, sir, I feel really great.
<s> Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
<s> Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?
<s> Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
<s> You're gonna be sick are you?
<s> You wanna be sick?
<s> Alexander de Large, sir.
<s> Murder, sir.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again.
<s> Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
<s> Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.
<s> Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
<s> Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
<s> Leave to carry on, sir, please?
<s> The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
<s> I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
<s> No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.
<s> Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park.
<s> Big case?
<s> Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
<s> In my office?
<s> Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
<s> He could'a been depressed.  It still doesn't tell me homicide.
<s> What am I gonna do with flowers?
<s> By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?
<s> Mom, Vincent.  Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke.
<s> I was just tryin' to...to...
<s> I give a shit whose fault it was, you're payin'!
<s> You're cool.
<s> His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
<s> I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
<s> Yes, Max?
<s> I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
<s> She's in the hospital.
<s> You'd do her a favor.
<s> In case <u>who</u> checks?
<s> He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
<s> Makes two of us.
<s> That's the reason?
<s> What happened to you?
<s> Who?
<s> But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
<s> Why the hell not?
<s> The guy came right at us!
<s> Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.
<s> Not testing.  <u>Using</u>.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.
<s> Do you still ride?
<s> I think you're different.
<s> Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
<s> Them who?
<s> That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
<s> Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye.  Hmm... Ahh...  Ooooo...
<s> You're certifiable.
<s> Flesh wound.  No big deal.
<s> Surprise me.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> Is this your dad?
<s> They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
<s> Right here in Manhattan.
<s> What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
<s> They're big details, Jerry.
<s> If that's what you want.  Yes.
<s> If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
<s> Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Now's not really the time to get into this --
<s> I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
<s> Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
<s> Come on.
<s> He gave it to me.
<s> Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
<s> Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own.  Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
<s> That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
<s> Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
<s> You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
<s> Only on the football field.
<s> If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
<s> Yes, that's right.
<s> I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
<s> Working.
<s> Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
<s> -- Understood.
<s> What the hell does that mean?
<s> Wasn't my idea.
<s> Yeah, I do.
<s> And Jonas?
<s> Ellie?
<s> All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
<s> Oh?  How's he doing?
<s> I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
<s> Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise.
<s> With me.
<s> Interesting analogy.  And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?
<s> We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
<s> Ellie.
<s> Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
<s> I'm not sure.  You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
<s> I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always.
<s> NORAD's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops; shuttle Endeavor's in sleep mode.
<s> This is how you see the sky?
<s> It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.
<s> This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
<s> In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
<s> -- but I don't believe it to be the truth.
<s> I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
<s> Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
<s> Small moves, Captain, small moves.
<s> Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
<s> You have your mother's hands...  There are no tests, Ellie.  We don't sit in judgment.  Think of us more as... librarians.  Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation...
<s> You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
<s> That's my girl...  Lights.
<s> You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
<s> That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
<s> That's my girl.  Done.
<s> Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
<s> Actually --
<s> 'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
<s> Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
<s> Jesus --
<s> I'm -- I'm fine.
<s> Wait -- hold on a minute --
<s> That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
<s> What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
<s> Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
<s> Maybe you're creating a monster.
<s> It's getting late...
<s> I can't do this --
<s> Hi.
<s> It was quite a page turner.
<s> Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell them your story.  Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.
<s> Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
<s> Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
<s> Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
<s> Git movin', I said.
<s> I'll make it a dollar.
<s> I got two years.
<s> What are you doin' here?
<s> Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
<s> She took off with that convertible feller...
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
<s> Sure he's got kings but you still gotta call him.
<s> I... I... I...
<s> Yes, Boss.
<s> Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
<s> Hey, Tattoo!
<s> I did three hitches in the Navy. It ain't bad. After a while, you get used to it and the time --
<s> Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady.
<s> Borrowin'.
<s> I call.
<s> 'Bout two hours left.
<s> Well --- okay. It's a deal. One cold drink, if'n you please. In advance. One chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand... That goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.
<s> He's gonna be awright.
<s> One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
<s> You jus' may be great at hangin' paper around the big cities, but us country boys is not entirely brainless. When it comes to the law, nothin' is understood.
<s> Come on, boy, come on, darlin'. You kin do her. Just let that ol' belly sag and enjoy itself. Stay loose, buddy. Eight more, between you and everlasting glory. Little ol' eggs, pigeon eggs, that's all, fish eggs practically.
<s> Gettin' up, Carr.
<s> Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.
<s> No. No chains either.
<s> You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
<s> Fear of what...
<s> A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
<s> Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?
<s> I know.  Do come and meet your guest.
<s> Stop acting like a silly little fag!
<s> Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
<s> Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
<s> And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
<s> Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
<s> Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
<s> What Friday?
<s> I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
<s> We know...  Send the book to evidence...
<s> You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
<s> Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
<s> It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
<s> You're calling me a crank?
<s> You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
<s> Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way.
<s> Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
<s> Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
<s> It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
<s> I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.
<s> Consistency is the hobgoblin of <u>little</u> minds.  Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with...
<s> What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
<s> You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
<s> He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
<s> Yes.  I have to go...
<s> I know, baby.  I know.
<s> What else?
<s> He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
<s> Over here.
<s> Someone broke into her place last night.  It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't...
<s> Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
<s> Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
<s> Just horseshit luck.
<s> It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
<s> You came in there with this attitude...
<s> He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
<s> You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
<s> Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
<s> Shut up.
<s> Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
<s> Good.
<s> The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
<s> Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
<s> That's always your privilege, sir.
<s> Helen Hudson...
<s> What does this mean?  Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He and Nikko don't even get on together...
<s> "Spokes<u>person</u>."
<s> We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
<s> In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
<s> You should have gone to the funeral.
<s> Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
<s> I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
<s> No. But when he's in that car...
<s> I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
<s> Yes.
<s> You could get your wish at any moment.
<s> What?
<s> I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
<s> Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
<s> Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.
<s> Ecru.
<s> No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
<s> Can I get you a glass of champagne?
<s> Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
<s> And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
<s> I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
<s> There's a spider in my room.
<s> It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
<s> Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear.
<s> By color.
<s> Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
<s> You took bets on my diagnosis?
<s> You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
<s> I'm not the one who's masquerading as a doctor. I'm not the one who's, who's...
<s> Anything interesting.
<s> I wasn't hungry.
<s> Good God.
<s> How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
<s> Do you?
<s> No, I need some serious household advice.
<s> What do you want to do?
<s> Oh, ok.   Maybe.
<s> Sure. Of course.
<s> I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
<s> No, it's not like that.
<s> Especially this last year.
<s> It's, it's really nice, Paul.
<s> He's a patient here.
<s> I start on Monday.
<s> I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
<s> Sure, I understand.
<s> I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
<s> I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
<s> I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
<s> You're there now?
<s> To tell you that we're interested in the property.
<s> And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
<s> I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
<s> I assume you want something?
<s> I know they won't be home tonight.
<s> Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
<s> You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
<s> No problem.
<s> I'm not any closer than you are.
<s> And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
<s> I can't believe you didn't check.
<s> What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
<s> What do you want now?
<s> Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
<s> French guys?    You mean like from France?
<s> No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
<s> This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
<s> We've got to get out of here.
<s> Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
<s> What the hell is he talking about?
<s> What are we going to do, take a taxi?
<s> I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
<s> Mr. Taylor?
<s> Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
<s> No.
<s> The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
<s> I know where she went.
<s> Glenmorangie.
<s> Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours.
<s> Thanks.
<s> You ask a lot of questions.
<s> No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
<s> It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
<s> That's why we're only breaking one arm.
<s> You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
<s> A car.
<s> It's for you.
<s> I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
<s> That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
<s> Shut up!
<s> If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
<s> Believe me, I've a lesson or two left to teach you!
<s> I heard you met Shu Lien today.
<s> His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
<s> Spare your energy.  I'll be back!
<s> Only the sword will settle this.
<s> Kneel!
<s> By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
<s> So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
<s> But something is going on at the Yu household.
<s> Have you questioned him yet?
<s> Well, we had talked...
<s> But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
<s> But Wudan does not accept women.
<s> She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl.
<s> My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
<s> Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
<s> Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
<s> Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
<s> I'm buying.
<s> The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.
<s> Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
<s> You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
<s> I think he's yours, now.
<s> You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
<s> I'm looking for a good guitar man.
<s> I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.
<s> I don't know you...
<s> You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
<s> Fine with me.
<s> Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
<s> Kill a dead guy?
<s> Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
<s> You might say that.
<s> Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
<s> Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
<s> You didn't show it to anybody?
<s> You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
<s> Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
<s> Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
<s> I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
<s> Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
<s> Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
<s> Yes.
<s> Wait, don't hang up.
<s> "I actually feel good about myself?"
<s> You must take me for a real idiot.
<s> I do not.
<s> You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you.
<s> Hi.
<s> Sure.
<s> Yeah, me neither.
<s> Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
<s> Don't think it's not going to cost you.
<s> Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
<s> I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.
<s> You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
<s> I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him.
<s> Why?
<s> You'd do that for me?
<s> I don't know.
<s> I did?
<s> I am?
<s> You think he'll like it?
<s> Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
<s> What, nervous I'm going to win?
<s> Baby?  Right on time.
<s> Jesus!
<s> Likewise I'm sure.
<s> Ronald?
<s> Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
<s> It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
<s> Have you succeeded in your task?
<s> Where'd she go?
<s> Oh yes.
<s> It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
<s> Will you calm down?
<s> I accept. Now get out.
<s> How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
<s> You will be discreet about this?
<s> Excuse me.
<s> Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
<s> Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
<s> You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you.
<s> Do you know when she'll be back?
<s> Yes, you already did.
<s> It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
<s> What's her name?
<s> You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
<s> She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
<s> I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
<s> What?
<s> I suppose so.
<s> Yes, daddy.
<s> Yes, I did.
<s> I'll show you.
<s> I didn't forget.
<s> But wishes don't come true.
<s> This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
<s> You called me by my name.
<s> I'm your friend.
<s> Whenever you want.
<s> I'll just never learn arithmetic.
<s> The numbers simply don't mean anything
<s> Don't cry, Amy.
<s> Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
<s> I wouldn't be surprised if it were a true wishing ring.
<s> Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
<s> But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
<s> Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
<s> But it was alive  it was fast and strong!
<s> Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days  those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
<s> No, thank you.
<s> No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
<s> My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead.
<s> I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise.
<s> 
<s> Jennifer gave her a make-over.
<s> Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
<s> No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
<s> So don't look in his eyes.
<s> I don't know.
<s> And she got the medium.
<s> What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
<s> What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
<s> Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
<s> Holy shit, I'm a freak.
<s> I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
<s> I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
<s> I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
<s> I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
<s> I still thought it was a purse.
<s> It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
<s> It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
<s> And he was missing an arm.
<s> Okay, I gotta go.
<s> I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
<s> Why not? There's been a murder.
<s> Peter keeps asking me out.
<s> The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
<s> You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
<s> I guess you'll find out.
<s> No. I won't let you do that.
<s> We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
<s> Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
<s> No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
<s> Knock what off?
<s> I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
<s> Yeah right... You better go.
<s> This really isn't a good time.
<s> You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
<s> Take your shower.
<s> On your desk.
<s> Did you change your hair?
<s> Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
<s> He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
<s> Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
<s> They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
<s> No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
<s> I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
<s> I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
<s> What about... those guys... I might have...
<s> Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
<s> Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.
<s> She's just so... pathetic.
<s> We're just trying to figure out what happened.
<s> We can just take this pillowcase.
<s> I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
<s> I told you she was innocent.
<s> Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
<s> Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
<s> What makes her think that?
<s> Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
<s> I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
<s> A hunch.  He might be able to...
<s> Patricia Crenshaw.
<s> <u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
<s> Why, yes.
<s> Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
<s> What is going on?
<s> No...  No doctor...
<s> Yes.
<s> But I...
<s> Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
<s> Just let me sit here for a moment? Ill go soon, and stop bothering you.
<s> You know something about me?
<s> I'm nothing then.
<s> I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help.
<s> No, it's the truth.
<s> Not that again...
<s> Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
<s> Don't worry about it.
<s> No...
<s> ) Listen, you little...
<s> I said you're fired.  Go on -- get outta here.
<s> I can't believe he'd do this.
<s> What do you mean, he's clean?
<s> You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
<s> Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
<s> Bob...
<s> Just what you think I mean.
<s> Sort of... Yeah.
<s> I was gonna do something with Joan.
<s> You could buy it on payments.
<s> That'd be great.
<s> I'm not sure... I might have.
<s> What?
<s> Oh... Thanks.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Dirty business we're in sometimes.
<s> He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.
<s> But it's ten-thirty at night.
<s> First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
<s> Uh...
<s> What's wrong with a magic trick?
<s> There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
<s> Just wait.
<s> I run a temp agency.
<s> You find people jobs?
<s> It's just more than anybody else does around here.
<s> Yeah... Bedtime.
<s> It's nice.
<s> ... Not exactly the Oval Office.
<s> And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
<s> NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
<s> To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
<s> No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know.  Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.
<s> Come on.
<s> Quiet!
<s> Gasparilla?
<s> Datura.
<s> Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
<s> We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
<s> Ain't no place safe.
<s> What you wanna do?
<s> The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.
<s> PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.
<s> Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
<s> Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
<s> Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
<s> Actually I don't really know Mutt.
<s> I don't think they're in school.
<s> How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.
<s> So much the better.
<s> "O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
<s> Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?
<s> All right.  I'll second that.
<s> The pleasure is mine.
<s> No.
<s> Are you going with Chet?
<s> That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
<s> Oh, Captain, My Captain. Is there poetry in math?
<s> I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
<s> A barbaric yawp.
<s> AHHHHHH!
<s> Okay.
<s> Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here.  And you'll be approving loans till you croak.
<s> But she's in love with: the moron son of my father's best friend.  What would the dead poets say about that?
<s> Father, I wasn't disputing you.
<s> Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
<s> Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Found what?
<s> First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
<s> Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
<s> What is that supposed to mean?
<s> Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
<s> I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm not playin' around here!
<s> And where is our point of arrival?
<s> 20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
<s> Who asked any?
<s> Shut up!
<s> I told you...
<s> Right... You have a boat.
<s> You should talk...
<s> You quit high school, lie about your age, join the navy, and next thing you know, four years are up and you need a way to make a living...
<s> If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
<s> So?
<s> I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones...
<s> Me??
<s> Joey...
<s> Where is everybody?
<s> Poolside?
<s> Like Mamooli's country...
<s> Nothing.
<s> Hey! Come out here!
<s> Shut up!
<s> Yeah.
<s> Fuckin' A!
<s> John,we're going huntin'.
<s> We're all going.
<s> Hey! Fuckin' A! Just... just like a hot shit... except cold.
<s> What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this?
<s> I'll get it! Where is it?
<s> You're full of shit.
<s> Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!
<s> I do!!!
<s> Couple of weeks... Listen --
<s> Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
<s> Where? Where is he?
<s> How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
<s> Linda, yeah.
<s> Oh. Fine.
<s> Merle, hey Merle, you got any socks?
<s> Here.
<s> Biederman, yes.
<s> Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
<s> Oh... You know...
<s> Would you?
<s> Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
<s> Naw, it's... I mean...
<s> What?
<s> C'mon. I've got the car.
<s> There's Vince!
<s> The shot?
<s> From Nam?
<s> What else?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Forget Sal?
<s> Sit down.
<s> You wanna bet?
<s> I'm gonna stay here, Nick.
<s> But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
<s> You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
<s> I can smell it.
<s> Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
<s> What did you say?
<s> It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
<s> And I want Doucet.
<s> We have to talk.
<s> Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.
<s> Keep 'em busy.
<s> You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
<s> I'm not fond of television comedies.
<s> Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
<s> Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.
<s> Good night.
<s> I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
<s> That cost me two weeks' pay.
<s> Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
<s> With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
<s> How ya feeling?
<s> I'm here.
<s> They always are.
<s> My mom says I'm gonna grow.
<s> They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --
<s> I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --
<s> That's my problem, Belle.
<s> A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
<s> No! No! I won't.
<s> All right, darling.
<s> That's just too bad --
<s> I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
<s> I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
<s> Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
<s> Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
<s> Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
<s> I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.
<s> Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property.
<s> What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
<s> You are afraid!
<s> You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
<s> Opportunities?
<s> No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
<s> They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
<s> Well, I --
<s> Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.
<s> Shall we?
<s> Ahem -- Neighbor Stone, we want--
<s> Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
<s> You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
<s> You are not so sure that he'll come.
<s> 5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
<s> He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
<s> That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
<s> We can still use my butter money.
<s> Not all of it?
<s> No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
<s> Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
<s> Oh -- Jabez.
<s> What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
<s> Jabez!
<s> I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
<s> That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
<s> All right, son -- if it helps.
<s> Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
<s> Wouldn't profit him none.
<s> Sure, Ma.
<s> And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
<s> Of course it's all right, son. You had Daniel Webster, didn't ye?  Breakfast's ready!  I've made a special surprise for Mr. Webster.
<s> Let him try it.
<s> Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.
<s> You aren't angry with me?
<s> You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
<s> Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
<s> Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
<s> Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
<s> I'll drink to that, Mr. Scratch!
<s> My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
<s> Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.
<s> Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag.
<s> You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
<s> So, why didn't you come?
<s> Just remember that when you sign for the tip.  They're paying for it, so don't be shy.
<s> We must shut down the building.  Go wider --!
<s> John.
<s> Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --
<s> That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
<s> What does he want?
<s> He had the detonators!  Theo?  Theo!
<s> I read about them in Time magazine.  When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions.  You have two hours to comply.
<s> This is what this is about?  Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.
<s> Who are you, then?
<s> One weekend I went to a combat ranch...  You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint?  Must sound pretty silly to you...
<s> When you're hot, you're hot.
<s> Sure.  Follow me.
<s> It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
<s> In my youth, partner.  In my youth.

<s> What are you doin' in there?
<s> They're okay.
<s> I got Sal.

<s> Yeah - it's all right... let's go.
<s> I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it.
<s> Yeah ...
<s> They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
<s> They gotta stop sayin' that.
<s> He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?
<s> Okay, Sonny.
<s> Let's move it, goddamn it.
<s> Okay, when do I get them?
<s> I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.
<s> What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.

<s> We'll have hamburgers on the plane. You ready?
<s> I speak what I feel.
<s> I forgot she's in here.

<s> Okay, newsman.  How much you make a week?  You're not talkin'.  You payin' me? What have you got for me?  We're givin' you entertainment ... what are you givin' us?

<s> You know what I'm talking about, did you fuck her?
<s> <i>Remove... ... the... right arm.</i>
<s> Yes.
<s> That's the only way you can cope with the route your life has taken. The fact that you made the choice to pursue this life- style... much to the chagrin of your mother... who is so clearly ashamed of you.

<s> Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
<s> I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
<s> You can't talk that way about my movie.
<s> It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.

<s> What?
<s> Dick.
<s> Okay.  Yeah.  We know
<s> I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
<s> I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --

<s> ...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
<s> Aren't you supposed to keep them?
<s> I thought you were supposed to keep them.
<s> So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.

<s> Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
<s> Why are you lecturing me?

<s> My mother's buying me a new car for college.

<s> I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
<s> For what?
<s> Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy
<s> What do you mean?
<s> No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --

<s> Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*
<s> Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
<s> You fuck for money.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.

<s> You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.  Was it outside, inside?
<s> Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
<s> Get the fuck away from me.
<s> <u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
<s> The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
<s> Let's just kill them.
<s> We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn.
<s> Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
<s> Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
<s> Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
<s> I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
<s> What little studio?
<s> I got a few Nite Owl questions.
<s> It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
<s> Someone must've pulled the records.
<s> Man, why do you keep asking me that?
<s> I never truck with no sissies!
<s> Believed what?
<s> You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.

<s> And now you'll provide them.

<s> Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
<s> Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
<s> I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
<s> Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
<s> What?
<s> I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.

<s> None.  Call it a hunch.

<s> What are you saying?
<s> Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
<s> You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.
<s> I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...
<s> I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
<s> I'm not his attorney.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Just for the criminals.
<s> Right.
<s> I saw a man die.
<s> The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
<s> I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
<s> This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
<s> Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.
<s> That's okay.
<s> It's over.
<s> Yeah.  I wish you could've met...

<s> That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
<s> I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
<s> I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
<s> It tastes like fish.
<s> I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.

<s> Fuck off.
<s> Mr. Dean--
<s> What are you talking--
<s> Where's mom?
<s> Do I know you?
<s> Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
<s> Did you take <u>anything</u>--anything at all--out of those Christmas bags I brought home last week.
<s> An investigation? It was a bus accident.
<s> Christ!
<s> Bobby--
<s> Bobby--
<s> Why would the NSA--
<s> No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
<s> Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.
<s> What the hell does it mean?
<s> There was a transfer.
<s> Get it.
<s> We don't know.
<s> And if it wasn't?
<s> Do you have visual?
<s> He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.
<s> The door was open, sir. I just need a signature.
<s> Hello!  Good morning.
<s> I don't care to bargain.
<s> Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
<s> In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.

<s> What?
<s> No.
<s> Yes.  Absolutely.
<s> I promise I'll come back.  I promise I'll never leave you.  And there's plenty of water and food. You can have a party.
<s> Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
<s> I know.
<s> Appropriate?
<s> Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
<s> I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
<s> Right.
<s> Shut-up!
<s> It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
<s> We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
<s> Where've you been?
<s> Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
<s> Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
<s> No-one should own music.  The real question is who wrote the song?

<s> Very true!
<s> Thousands of people did die, just different people.
<s> Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise.  To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't I couldn't even do that properly.

<s> To arm-twisting.
<s> I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
<s> I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
<s> Are you crazy?
<s> Because I'm a nurse.
<s> Your friend?
<s> He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.

<s> Hey! -
<s> I'm not sewing anything else.
<s> I've met you before.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I try not to expect you.
<s> I should go to the house, get breakfast.
<s> I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
<s> I'll always go back to that church.
<s> It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
<s> No.  He's - no.
<s> I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
<s> A toddler
<s> I had a hotel room.
<s> Go away.
<s> Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
<s> I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
<s> What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.

<s> Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
<s> He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
<s> You got a better idea?
<s> With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.
<s> I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.
<s> Who am I?
<s> I sincerely hope so.
<s> Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously.
<s> So what?
<s> You can't.
<s> Not a word.
<s> I'm paying...one point five million and change. I hate round numbers.
<s> Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.
<s> Got it.
<s> I never carry...baggage.

<s> So you had to be your own lifeline.
<s> Got it.
<s> Yes. Yes.
<s> It's your mistake.
<s> Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
<s> You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
<s> Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
<s> There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
<s> I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
<s> No. You'll see when we get inside.
<s> Call it a new tradition.
<s> It was wrong to deceive you.
<s> Seen one billion, seen them all.
<s> The disc is still in there.
<s> No way.
<s> Get out of here!
<s> But--
<s> What about you?
<s> My god--
<s> Next time I'll use valet parking.
<s> Suspicious, after all these years?
<s> I'm waiting for the tell part.
<s> Erin, you've been here three weeks.  If you don't know how to do your job by now, I am not about to do it for you.
<s> What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
<s> Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
<s> Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
<s> It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
<s> Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
<s> Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
<s> Wow.  Why would they do that?
<s> It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
<s> If you hadn't used profanity --
<s> You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I got a lot of bills to pay.
<s> Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
<s> So you think we got 'em scared?
<s> That wasn't an offer.  A million would've been an offer.  When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
<s> Erin --
<s> That's crazy -- why not?
<s> Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
<s> Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
<s> I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day.
<s> It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
<s> Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
<s> Not in my world.
<s> Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
<s> "Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
<s> You're not gonna be there.
<s> This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
<s> Erin?  What are you --
<s> Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too.
<s> Say you were wrong.
<s> Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
<s> Take it.
<s> At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
<s> Not anymore.
<s> There's more than one kind?
<s> Good luck.  Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...
<s> Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
<s> So did I.
<s> Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
<s> You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
<s> Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
<s> Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
<s> Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
<s> I do.
<s> I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
<s> Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
<s> No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
<s> One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
<s> I'm just saying --
<s> No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them.  But you know what?  They're wrong.
<s> I can't leave my job, George.
<s> Hunh-uh.  Not yet.  Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
<s> I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
<s> You know me.  I pick things up real fast.
<s> We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more sleep.
<s> What's going on?
<s> Yeah.  Who are you?
<s> It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.
<s> Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
<s> Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
<s> Yes, Admiral .... soon.
<s> I'm cold ... so cold ...
<s> But Han and Leia will surely die.
<s> Howls.
<s> Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
<s> I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
<s> You know the Jedi Master?
<s> You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
<s> Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
<s> I'm going to see what it is.
<s> Yes.
<s> This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
<s> Or you ran into something ....
<s> To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
<s> They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
<s> Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
<s> Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
<s> A mining colony.
<s> It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
<s> Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.
<s> Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
<s> ... just remember that, cause I'll be back ...
<s> Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
<s> Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
<s> You may call me Leia.
<s> His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.
<s> Luke!
<s> Not yet.  They're working on it now.
<s> What is it?
<s> If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
<s> Well, what now?
<s> I thought you knew this person.
<s> Han's leaving?
<s> You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.
<s> You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
<s> Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
<s> Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
<s> I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
<s> I'll die first.
<s> Never.
<s> C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
<s> We'll see.
<s> We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
<s> If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
<s> What's the little black box do?
<s> Having second thoughts?
<s> There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
<s> Hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
<s> Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
<s> I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
<s> They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
<s> Oh no, it's the Doctor.
<s> Sewers. Come on.
<s> What the hell is this?
<s> Who?
<s> ...Perceval!
<s> I cannot--
<s> I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
<s> So be it, to the death.
<s> Speak of the devil!...
<s> That's not why you came.
<s> Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
<s> Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
<s> You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king...
<s> Your mother told you that?
<s> You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.
<s> You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
<s> I will run.
<s> That I cannot.
<s> I am the desert, where water disappears--
<s> In here!
<s> Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
<s> Yes, I'm affraid it is.
<s> We still don't know.
<s> What's her name?
<s> Yes, I go now.
<s> Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
<s> No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
<s> What man?
<s> Depression?
<s> Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
<s> Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
<s> No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
<s> That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
<s> The closet
<s> I don't know
<s> Do you not like him like daddy?
<s> Well I heard differently.
<s> Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!
<s> Honey it's to help you.
<s> St. Mike's.
<s> Damien Karras.
<s> That's his office back of St. Mike's. He's our psychiatric counsellor. He had a pretty rough knock last night poor guy, his mother passed away. She was living by herself and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her.
<s> Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
<s> Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
<s> Who's in it?
<s> If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?
<s> You and us.
<s> Uh Huh.
<s> Uoy era ohw.
<s> Okay
<s> I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
<s> I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced-
<s> But deliver us from the evil one.
<s> I think the point is to make us dispair... To see our selves as... animal and ugly... To reject the possibillity that God could love us.
<s> I don't know anyone who fits the description.
<s> I've seen it.
<s> I don't know.
<s> It's our goddamn car!
<s> Suit yourself.
<s> Teeth.
<s> No.
<s> Two at a time?
<s> Accident?
<s> Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association.
<s> Am I late?
<s> What's the point?
<s> Frank.
<s> Lotta water.
<s> Like an angel.
<s> Huh?
<s> Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
<s> Only on odd days.
<s> I don't gotta go.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
<s> We don't get a gig.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah, and what put him up there?
<s> We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
<s> You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
<s> It never was.
<s> She's here.
<s> Yeah, fine.
<s> Right.
<s> You recognized me.
<s> So what do you think?
<s> Thanks, but I've got plans.
<s> No, you take the right.
<s> I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?
<s> I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
<s> It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
<s> Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
<s> Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?
<s> February?
<s> Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
<s> I can't make the tenth.
<s> I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
<s> Twenty-eight years.
<s> No.
<s> Later.
<s> I'll take the Mallory.
<s> Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
<s> I can keep the beat.
<s> All right.
<s> Blanche.
<s> Well, that's fine --
<s> Miss --
<s> What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
<s> Catchy.  You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond?
<s> We're a team.  We work together.
<s> Hey!
<s> Right.
<s> I said I was sorry.
<s> For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
<s> The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
<s> Baker's unabridged.
<s> Virgins.
<s> Smells like fish.
<s> Great.
<s> People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
<s> No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?
<s> Huh?
<s> We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
<s> You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.
<s> Baker.  Jack Baker.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.
<s> Frank works hard.
<s> His kid's sick.
<s> Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
<s> Hey, business is business.
<s> Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
<s> Look. You don't know good. All right?
<s> How do you know?
<s> Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
<s> Ed? How many people live here?
<s> Soap?
<s> He called her.
<s> Nervous?
<s> Coffee?
<s> If I see him.
<s> What happened to the donut king?
<s> What are they?
<s> Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
<s> Okay.  How'd yours go?
<s> Good to see you, Ma.
<s> He hit a guard.
<s> Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
<s> Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
<s> One last time.  It's important ...
<s> Don't hang up ...
<s> She doesn't know -- and she never will.
<s> Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
<s> Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
<s> Not anymore.
<s> Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK.  And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
<s> Five seconds.
<s> What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
<s> Like you know anything about it.
<s> Get rid of them.
<s> Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
<s> Normally, I would.  But today ...
<s> No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
<s> Have fun at work.
<s> Great.
<s> Yeah Jack, her assistant...
<s> You?  Married?
<s> Is that tonight?
<s> A broker? Really. And now youre in the tire business?
<s> Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
<s> Im not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
<s> But I think I like you better this way...
<s> Youre jumping, sweetheart...
<s> Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
<s> Big Eds.
<s> Maybe I dont say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
<s> Its just two kids, right?
<s> Im telling you, those rules dont apply to me, Arn.
<s> I don't do that.  That's just not for me...
<s> What the hell is happening to me?!
<s> Brought what on myself?! I didnt do anything!
<s> Give me my goddamn life back!
<s> Look, I just want my life back.  Now whats it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Lets talk turkey!  How much money...?
<s> Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
<s> Get out, I call 911.
<s> Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
<s> It would help me if we were.
<s> Thanks.  To you too...
<s> Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party...
<s> ...my feet are hurtin...
<s> Its ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We dont have time for wining and dining.
<s> Do what?
<s> Really.
<s> Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Whyd we ever leave?
<s> If you want to look at it that way...
<s> Thats my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
<s> I want it...
<s> Enjoy it, sweetheart...
<s> I dont think Id fight you on that one...
<s> What are you talking about, Jack?
<s> Then get a goddamn snow blower!
<s> Dont worry about it, Jack...
<s> Thats the one...
<s> Jack.
<s> That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
<s> That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
<s> But youre not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
<s> Of course I did.
<s> My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you'd walk by.
<s> This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not that bad.  He's just a little...  Larger than life.
<s> Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.
<s> This makes five.
<s> Yeah, nine years straight.
<s> If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
<s> Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
<s> Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
<s> Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.
<s> I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
<s> And you can?  Power it up?
<s> What do you mean "complete"?
<s> What about you?
<s> What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
<s> Right, whatever, have fun.
<s> I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
<s> Johnny.
<s> Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
<s> Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
<s> You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
<s> Not at all.
<s> Ben did this.
<s> Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
<s> What in the world would give me that idea?
<s> With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...
<s> You <u>need</u> a doctor.
<s> Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
<s> I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
<s> It is.  There's something we need to talk about.  Something I need to ask you...
<s> Susan.  What are you doing?
<s> Phase Two.
<s> No...
<s> Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
<s> It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
<s> If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
<s> Here's the Surgeon.
<s> We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
<s> As part of the Crew.
<s> Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
<s> It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
<s> Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.
<s> Yes, Cora.
<s> No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.
<s> He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
<s> I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
<s> Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
<s> Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --
<s> I feel much better now...
<s> Under a cloud without cause, I take it.
<s> Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
<s> Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
<s> Nothing -- against all that force.
<s> Take a close look at your Soul, and your Infinity, and your God out there --
<s> It I can clear this Central Nerve, that <may> be enough...
<s> We could follow the Optic Nerve to the corner of the Eye.
<s> What about Dr. Michaels?
<s> I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
<s> If there's any chance --
<s> Well, we better get on with it.
<s> His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
<s> Sorry, but the situation has changed.
<s> Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!
<s> Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
<s> Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
<s> I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
<s> Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
<s> I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
<s> No.
<s> HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN' SHOT INNA FAISH! I WENT'N GOTTA FUCKIN' MONEY! I GET SHOT FUCKIN' PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH! I'M TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR! THAT FUCKERZH MINE!
<s> You want your own wife kidnapped?
<s> What the heck d'ya mean?
<s> Yah, but this TruCoat -
<s> Oh, yah, I know that!
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> White Bear Lake?
<s> Oh sure.
<s> Can you be any more specific?
<s> Yah, that can happen.
<s> Oh, man!
<s> What... What is it all about?
<s> My father-in-law, he's the owner.
<s> Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
<s> Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
<s> All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
<s> This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
<s> Yah.
<s> I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.
<s> What's goin' on there?
<s> No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime -
<s> Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
<s> Yah.
<s> Yah.
<s> Oh, yah?
<s> Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
<s> Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
<s> Well, how the heck are ya?
<s> Yah... Yah, yah. Geeze, Margie!
<s> Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
<s> I'm sorry, Mike.
<s> I always liked ya so much...
<s> Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
<s> So?
<s> Yah, is this Marge?
<s> Margie Olmstead?
<s> What'd he say?
<s> Yah.
<s> Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
<s> Love ya, Margie.
<s> No, no.
<s> Yah.
<s> We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
<s> Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
<s> Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
<s> Yeah, both of us.
<s> It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
<s> Here are your flight coupons.  Call me from the road if there are any snags.  Your itinerary...
<s> No, I wasn't aware...
<s> Dynamite?
<s> You need healthy, natural sleep. Chew valerian root and get some more exercise.
<s> Really?
<s> You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
<s> I don't know -- am I?
<s> You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
<s> Like testicular cancer?
<s> I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
<s> It suits you.
<s> No... no problem.
<s> Hear what?
<s> Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
<s> Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
<s> You are an insane person.
<s> Who's this?
<s> Who's this?
<s> Please return your seatbacks to their full upright and locked position.
<s> Tyler Durden.
<s> Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.
<s> Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
<s> The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
<s> So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
<s> Where do you want it?  In the face?
<s> After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
<s> What car?
<s> Oh, a new riot control grenade...  "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."
<s> Good answer.
<s> He was obviously able to handle it.
<s> No.  Not at all.
<s> Yeah, I'm sure.
<s> "The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
<s> We don't... ?
<s> Imagine how he feels.
<s> What should I have told you?
<s> What are you doing?!
<s> If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
<s> You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
<s> Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
<s> I quit.
<s> Yes.
<s> You need me.
<s> ... no, no, no...
<s> It's the only way to get rid of you...
<s> What?
<s> You told me you'd say that.
<s> You told me you'd say that, too.
<s> You're welcome to join our club.
<s> We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
<s> Please, God, no...
<s> Too much school.
<s> I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
<s> I hope you're ready for this.
<s> So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
<s> No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
<s> I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
<s> Yes.  I was in a hospital.  There was screaming... A nurse was choking me.  I couldn't tell what she looked like, but the name tag was right in my face.  Kalarjian.
<s> I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
<s> I have to save Eugene!
<s> Taken care of.
<s> Your entire world view just went out the window.  I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this.  I promise.
<s> Blow me.
<s> Maybe.  What's this about?
<s> Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
<s> Yeah, so what happened?
<s> Hold on.
<s> I don't...what if I made a mistake?
<s> I...I don't know.
<s> I know, we'll be there soon.
<s> Who am I, David Blane?
<s> He's not a witch.
<s> I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
<s> I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  I would know.
<s> Right. April 25th.
<s> That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
<s> No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
<s> No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
<s> Don't do it! Don't do it!
<s> That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
<s> Look, there's something you should all know.
<s> You're the fuckin' devil.
<s> Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
<s> In Death...
<s> No harm. No foul.
<s> They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
<s> You have a responsibility to tell me.
<s> That's what I'm doin'!
<s> I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!
<s> That's right, buddy.
<s> Really?  How come he didn't take me?
<s> Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
<s> Show me how it operates.
<s> Fermented fish sauce.
<s> Bastards.  Let's get some shots.
<s> Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?
<s> It means "virgin."  My mother was comedian.
<s> Huntington Beach, California.
<s> Nguyen is good boy.
<s> Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
<s> You think you are... .
<s> Why you don't feel love?  Not allowed?  Dead inside, maybe?  You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you?  In-vulnerabo?  Bullshit!
<s> We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
<s> We just take pictures?
<s> Christ almighty.
<s> Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
<s> It's not over.  You made one mistake.
<s> Colonel.
<s> Am I out of here?
<s> I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.
<s> I say we tape him to a chair.
<s> Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
<s> Well, there's nobody special!
<s> I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
<s> Meeting ... people.
<s> Really?
<s> The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.
<s> This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
<s> <u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!
<s> Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
<s> Okay.  ... I love you...
<s> Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
<s> Thanks.
<s> ... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
<s> You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
<s> I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
<s> Where?  Maybe we can.
<s> It was a crime.
<s> Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
<s> "OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
<s> Great place huh?
<s> Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
<s> I'm not...  Now, where are those shoes...
<s> Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
<s> I don't know.
<s> No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
<s> You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
<s> You're a true <u>friend</u>.
<s> You're totally gone, aren't you?
<s> Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
<s> Bingo!
<s> I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
<s> Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?
<s> I don't like horror movies!
<s> Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
<s> No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
<s> You don't have to say that.
<s> And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
<s> Shhh...
<s> A wig?
<s> Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?!
<s> It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
<s> You can sing the song.
<s> That's right, hand.
<s> Yeah, great.  Why don't you throw Z's for 19 frames, and then roll a strike on the last ball in the last frame of a losing game? Just wonderful.
<s> I'm not.
<s> I'm not some piece a crap.
<s> Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...
<s> I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
<s> It brings out my eyes...
<s> I don't know.
<s> How do you know it's clean?
<s> Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
<s> Now don't...
<s> Very nice.
<s> What?
<s> I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
<s> I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...
<s> No, thanks...
<s> I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
<s> At being a fake.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Yeah, I think I could.
<s> Of course I'd like to.
<s> Oh. You have to tell me that.
<s> I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry.
<s> Is she?
<s> What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
<s> That's what I mean...
<s> Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
<s> A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
<s> Why you have an attitude for?
<s> Hi.
<s> You know. I got a lot, more than one.
<s> I can't!
<s> Eddie from Baruch, the one who was sittin' wit' dat little girl;
<s> Yeah, that's right, you got it girl.
<s> Wha'?
<s> What?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
<s> You're kidding.
<s> He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
<s> Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
<s> You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
<s> Thank God, the police.
<s> We play tennis at the club.
<s> Your aunt?
<s> Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
<s> Just relax.
<s> I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
<s> No idea.
<s> Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
<s> Nothing. They're still there.
<s> My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
<s> This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
<s> You may be right.
<s> Well, I'm fully covered.
<s> Yes. Where you from, Harry?
<s> Where are you going?
<s> Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.
<s> I'm all ears.
<s> My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
<s> Sure, all drifters do.
<s> Sure.
<s> I'm sorry?
<s> Cute thing.
<s> I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
<s> I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
<s> I ordered lunch.
<s> Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
<s> Here, take mine.
<s> That's what I want to know.
<s> What does all this mean?
<s> But I've seen the deed.
<s> Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
<s> I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
<s> But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.
<s> Don't tell me I can't --
<s> Cabana one.
<s> Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
<s> What?
<s> And a damn fine one, I might add.
<s> Irwin...
<s> John!
<s> I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
<s> Don't say it.  Orange juice?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Who?
<s> Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
<s> I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
<s> Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
<s> 'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.
<s> Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
<s> I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
<s> Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
<s> You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
<s> Make eye contact when you say that.
<s> Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
<s> Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!
<s> You gave it to the girls for one.
<s> Fluck you!
<s> It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit!  Mr. Bus Driver, stop!
<s> Ye-ah.
<s> Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.
<s> I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!  Get that stick out of your mouth.  These things are killers, man.  Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...
<s> Good news is that yeah, I found him.  The bad news is...
<s> Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
<s> You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.
<s> Really?
<s> <u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
<s> Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
<s> Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
<s> Julian, you're fired.
<s> What?
<s> What?
<s> Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Who's this --
<s> You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
<s> Je n'ai jamais vu tant de srenit. Elle m'a demand de tes nouvelles et si nous tions heureux.
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off and I'll knock you into the middle of next week.
<s> Nothing in there except a New York street map.
<s> How'd I know he had a knife.
<s> He coulda been white.
<s> Hey, I thought we come for a drink.
<s> Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
<s> Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
<s> Darling, may I have this one?
<s> Why is it called Hellgate?
<s> Well, I think you do.
<s> Switches are shorted out.
<s> There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
<s> No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
<s> Frank...Frank Sullivan.
<s> What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
<s> My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...
<s> I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
<s> Yeah...I think so.
<s> I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
<s> I lost you.
<s> It did, Pop.  It did.
<s> October 12, 1969.
<s> Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
<s> You there?
<s> He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
<s> No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
<s> What...
<s> Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
<s> Better.
<s> The Ham radio.  That's how come he didn't die in the fire.
<s> Whoa, I just...I just...
<s> Yeah.  That's it.
<s> Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
<s> This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
<s> So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
<s> Yeah.  Sure.
<s> I try to be.
<s> Talk about dumb luck.  Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it.  Bets part is she's the first victim.  She knew the doer.  I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
<s> I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You just don't know it yet.
<s> Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
<s> I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
<s> I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
<s> Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
<s> Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
<s> Stop the car!  Now!!
<s> Sheriff, you better take this.
<s> It's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.
<s> We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
<s> Daddy, what is going on?
<s> It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
<s> There was this monster.  He was after me.  He wanted to kill me.
<s> Why?
<s> We'll scare 'em right back.
<s> I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
<s> Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!
<s> -- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have your hundred grand ready.  For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
<s> The what?
<s> Twenty.
<s> Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
<s> I know everything about you, Diana.
<s> Do you have to ask?
<s> Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
<s> For a good reason.
<s> I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
<s> What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
<s> The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
<s> My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
<s> Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
<s> I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
<s> Rennie's not coming.
<s> The fire alarm...
<s> Don't be ridiculous!
<s> I packed it. Just for us.
<s> Where is she?
<s> She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?
<s> It's not that simple.
<s> I'd love to.
<s> Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
<s> Is the ship going to sink??
<s> I'm not!!
<s> Please, hurry...
<s> Where you're going, mister?
<s> I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
<s> What do I exude?
<s> Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
<s> That was a big mistake.
<s> We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
<s> There are things that speak to us from the past.
<s> The American theater doesn't need people like that.
<s> She was very evasive.
<s> Yes. What are you implying?
<s> This could be it.
<s> Let's work on it.
<s> Does what feel comfortable?
<s> She's dying.
<s> Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
<s> And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
<s> It's only our first date.
<s> I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
<s> All right. What's been going on?
<s> You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
<s> Get yourself something to eat.
<s> It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
<s> So what are you going to do about it?
<s> I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
<s> You're out of bullets.
<s> Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
<s> I was educated by nuns.
<s> This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
<s> Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
<s> Someone waiting for you?
<s> I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
<s> Our Steven not only disguises himself.
<s> I haven't come to you.
<s> Stop!
<s> Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.
<s> Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
<s> A great deal.
<s> I --
<s> I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
<s> No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
<s> Who's leading them?
<s> You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
<s> Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
<s> This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
<s> Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
<s> None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
<s> Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
<s> Where do we start?
<s> What a relief.
<s> Thank you, no.
<s> Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
<s> Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
<s> If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome.
<s> I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life.
<s> Michael's.
<s> They said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human.  From where I sit the world could stand a little improving.
<s> I've found him too.
<s> In the South Wing.
<s> You celebrate, Jerome?
<s> Yes...<i>yes</i>...
<s> You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
<s> Come on.
<s> I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
<s> Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
<s> I can't do this.
<s> My license expired, let's get out of here.
<s> Assumed name... Houston.
<s> Whisky and a peach.
<s> I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
<s> That bad?
<s> If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
<s> Do it my way.
<s> She's on TV.
<s> And switched keys.
<s> Why, there's nothing on the news?
<s> I think you liked it with him.
<s> I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
<s> I don't want to hear it.
<s> We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
<s> Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
<s> Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
<s> Pull over.
<s> I really hope you have a nice trip.
<s> It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
<s> Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
<s> 'Bout five thousand.
<s> I Just want to find a suitcase.
<s> I know.
<s> Did Eric Pake pull her?
<s> How?
<s> When did you find out?
<s> Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
<s> Was the steering faulty?
<s> What about?
<s> Why?
<s> I must go. I'm in a hurry.
<s> He was gentlemanly. I like that.
<s> He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
<s> No, do you really?
<s> Go on.
<s> Really?
<s> Of course. Where else?
<s> We're there now.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Yeah.
<s> The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
<s> Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
<s> Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
<s> Right.
<s> Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
<s> Where you off to?
<s> How many?
<s> Definitely.
<s> Funny.  Can I phone London?
<s> Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
<s> How'd you know I wouldn't?
<s> Not much.
<s> It would be. If they were still living.
<s> A bereavement. A death in the family.
<s> Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
<s> Yep.
<s> We've got to take you back to London.
<s> Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
<s> That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred.
<s> I...I don't know.
<s> You get a bad month, all of a...
<s> Eh...?
<s> No, it's not that simple, Dave...
<s> What?
<s> What?
<s> They...
<s> Someone should hurt them.
<s> How?
<s> What? 
<s> Huh.
<s> What could we get for them?  I don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...I don't know...Hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them?  All told...must be, I'd... three bucks a throw...I don't know.
<s> Is that what I said?
<s> I'm sorry?
<s> Why would they come to me?
<s> Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
<s> What do you care...?
<s> What?  You can't do any what?
<s> Well, they're old.  I saw the shit that they were giving you.
<s> It's a waste of time.
<s> What?
<s> Do you understand?  My stuff is mine, his stuff is ours.  I'm taking half of his commissions-- now, you work it out.
<s> Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
<s> That they're going to be upset.
<s> The leads come in, I'll let...
<s> Excuse me...
<s> Don't fuck with me, fella.  I'm talking about a fuckin' Cadillac car that you owe me...
<s> Would you excuse us, please.
<s> Levene!
<s> I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
<s> What two?
<s> ...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
<s> You're saying that I'm fucked.
<s> Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
<s> Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
<s> The deal still stands, our other thing.
<s> The leads are coming.
<s> You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
<s> ...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
<s> Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
<s> Mmm.
<s> I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
<s> You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one. 
<s> Only the beginning...
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> My ass.  I told 'em.  Listen to this: I said...
<s> They took the phones...
<s> Mmm.
<s> "I want to tell you something, Harriet..."
<s> Yes.
<s> No, his wife is.
<s> One moment, I'll be right with you.  In fact, a...one point, which I spoke to you of which  I can't talk to you about here.
<s> Mm.
<s> It's a common reaction, Jim.  I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  This woman can cook...
<s> But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
<s> Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I told you.
<s> Tell me again.  Your wife.
<s> We're going to speak to her.
<s> I...
<s> Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
<s> Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to...
<s> I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
<s>  What?  You read it in the papers?
<s>  You must understand, this is all new to me...
<s> Let's go.
<s> You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
<s> I want you to help me, Fredo.
<s> You know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did.  To have kids, to have a family.
<s> ...Who?
<s> But, you told me yourself...
<s> What?
<s> Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
<s> No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
<s> Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
<s> Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
<s> Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
<s> Tom, what do I do now?
<s> Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
<s> I don't think that's necessary.
<s> This meeting is adjourned.
<s> Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
<s> You haven't heard me.
<s> Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
<s> He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
<s> I do not.
<s> When do we talk?
<s> We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
<s> I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there.
<s> It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
<s> Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
<s> I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
<s> It's important.
<s> Sitting right behind you.
<s> Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
<s> We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
<s> Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
<s> Weird.
<s> Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
<s> Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
<s> Expect nothing fancy.
<s> Your wife?
<s> He is dead now, twenty years.
<s> Well...no, not really --
<s> But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
<s> What did she mean by going flooey?
<s> What was wrong?
<s> You mean -- you really want to draw me?
<s> You don't say?  Which picture?
<s> All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.
<s> No.  I'm fine.
<s> Sounds like something you feed the dog.
<s> Your family ate dripping?
<s> What?
<s> I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> This David's a friend?
<s> Did anyone laugh?
<s> You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
<s> You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
<s> But we have to match the other sketch.
<s> You first.
<s> You were a soldier?
<s> No harm done.
<s> Never gave it much thought.
<s> The Great War?
<s> That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
<s> Not at all.
<s> What'd you say?
<s> There are straps in back.
<s> Fuck off!
<s> Have a drink?
<s> "The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
<s> Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.
<s> Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
<s> You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
<s> Yes?
<s> Luminal.
<s> Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
<s> She is beautiful.
<s> I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
<s> Of course.  This afternoon.
<s> A visitor.
<s> One likes to live simply.
<s> No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
<s> Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
<s> He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
<s> Don't go away.
<s> Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
<s> About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --
<s> No, but you dress like an asshole ...
<s> My version of "take this job and shove it..."
<s> How ya doing?
<s> Yes ... Kip ...
<s> But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --
<s> I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ...
<s> By the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin' around in space ships ...
<s> You know my back.
<s> Something like that -
<s> No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
<s> Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
<s> Lazy ... Lazy ... I ask you, Freb: what's the matter with kids today?
<s> How you doing, man?
<s> There's no one left ...
<s> He didn't mess up. There it is ...
<s> No.
<s> I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
<s> What time of year?
<s> What do you say, Toby?,
<s> Yeah... You want a ride...
<s> I dunno ...
<s> Hello, Memphis --
<s> Yeah ...
<s> Yeah -
<s> Something like that -
<s> About what?
<s> C'mon, man... My "demise..."  Overreaction
<s> I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
<s> How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
<s> Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
<s> I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
<s> I know. I've missed you, too
<s> What for -- ?
<s> Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
<s> On account of me.
<s> A distinction worth noting ...
<s> I always thought you'd follow me up.
<s> Oh. Okay. Right.
<s> I take out my slim-jim...
<s> Woo-woo-wooooo!
<s> Wrong preposition...
<s> No worries ...
<s> I dunno. I know a place.
<s> Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
<s> The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
<s> "A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
<s> I'll see you soon --
<s> Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
<s> Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
<s> You sure I can't go with ya?
<s> Not really -
<s> Checkin' it out
<s> No more shines, Billy.
<s> Nods.
<s> Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
<s> I'm just having my last few drinks.
<s> Shit.
<s> It'll be okay.
<s> I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
<s> But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
<s> What did he say, exactly?
<s> Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn't I tell you I gotta get out of here first.  I gotta straighten every- thing out with Paulie or I'm dead.
<s> Just get me out.
<s> Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
<s> Jimmy.
<s> Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
<s> Nah.
<s> He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
<s> I can't make any more deliveries.
<s> My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.
<s> You're some fucking jerk.
<s> I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
<s> --or a tail--
<s> No, and we got four of 'em.
<s> Gone.
<s> Week after I'm twenty-one.
<s> Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day...
<s> See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.
<s> You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
<s> You caught that, huh?
<s> You could put a pool in that backyard.
<s> All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
<s> So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
<s> I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'.
<s> What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
<s> Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets in his car and drives home.
<s> The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
<s> You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
<s> You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
<s> Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
<s> Allegedly, what I am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if I had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now.
<s> Good, it was all right.
<s> That's one aspect of what we do.
<s> It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
<s> It's touching me.
<s> With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
<s> Really?
<s> I'm pretty sure it's right.
<s> Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
<s> Yeah, cured polio.
<s> No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
<s> I do.
<s> --Gerry--
<s> "Undermine?"
<s> He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
<s> Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
<s> --And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
<s> --I don't have any anger at you--
<s> That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
<s> I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
<s> You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
<s> Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
<s> Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.
<s> Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
<s> Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
<s> How about the ones on that shelf?
<s> I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
<s> You've never been on a plane.
<s> Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
<s> Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
<s> I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
<s> You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
<s> Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
<s> I guess.
<s> What?
<s> Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
<s> I didn't want the job.
<s> It's not your fault.
<s> It's not your fault.
<s> It's not your fault.
<s> Yeah, I think so.
<s> What?
<s> It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
<s> Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
<s> In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
<s> No.
<s> Not far from here, South Boston.
<s> Aah, it's kind of a hike.
<s> All right, all right. We'll go.
<s> Like me?
<s> Come one Will. I just want to know.
<s> No.
<s> Yeah, but how do you know?
<s> What am I scared of?
<s> --Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
<s> I'm not honest?
<s> You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery
<s> I never cared about that.
<s> I love you, Will.  No take-backs.
<s> We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
<s> We got to get outa here right away. Ever'body here? Where's Uncle John?
<s> Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.
<s> What'd he look like again?
<s> Sure, but what is this?
<s> But--but how we gonna eat?
<s> Which way is House 25?
<s> Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
<s> You got dances too?
<s> I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.
<s> They never wrote you nothing?
<s> You're right!
<s> Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
<s> No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
<s> Why don't you get to it, buddy?
<s> Naw--not much!
<s> Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
<s> Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
<s> This here's a strike.
<s> Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.
<s> And I ain't gonna listen either. I tol' you what I'm gonna do.  And I don't give a hoot in a hollow if they's oranges and grapes crowdin' a fella outa bed even, I ain't a- goin' to California!  This here's my country. I b'long *here*.  It ain't no good--  --but it's mine.
<s> And can't nobody *make* me go, either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'.
<s> No longer'n we can get acrost her.
<s> Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
<s> Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
<s> I know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him. How 'bout gas, Tommy?
<s> Now don't get sassy, Ma.
<s> No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.
<s> Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son 
<s> Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
<s> Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
<s> Are you crazy?
<s> Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
<s> Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
<s> Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted. Awright, this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20,000 people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin, wes' account a this han'bill. Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs! Does that make sense?
<s> Whatsa matter?
<s> Ain't gonna be no trouble.
<s> Yeah...
<s> What?
<s> You could've been a contender, huh?
<s> He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
<s> Correct.  That's for you. Keep it.
<s> It's nice to see you again.
<s> Not much else.
<s> I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
<s> Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
<s> This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
<s> Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
<s> It's something I do...
<s> That's probably a good idea.
<s> You don't understand...
<s> They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."
<s> Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
<s> If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
<s> Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
<s> No harm no foul.
<s> Hard to get good help these days.
<s> Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
<s> Okay.
<s> No...
<s> All of it?
<s> It's a place where religious people--
<s> Jim?
<s> Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
<s> I have a headache. You have a headache?
<s> You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
<s> Yeah. I guess we did.
<s> I think I'll go see Debi today.
<s> I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
<s> Yeah...
<s> Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
<s> That's too bad.
<s> Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
<s> Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.
<s> You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
<s> Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
<s> Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
<s> Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
<s> Need a lift?
<s> Feel good?
<s> She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
<s> Ssshhh...  Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've got, just for now. Can you do that?
<s> Annie!
<s> Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
<s> Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
<s> You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
<s> I think they call it a pasture.
<s> Did you go riding?
<s> Tom?
<s> NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
<s> What?... Oh baby...
<s> Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement.
<s> Hi.
<s> We're very lucky.
<s> Okay.
<s> Oh. Right. I'll call him.
<s> All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
<s> They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there.
<s> No.
<s> Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
<s> He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
<s> I know. We miss you too.
<s> Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
<s> About what?
<s> Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
<s> Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
<s> It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.
<s> Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway.
<s> Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
<s> Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
<s> It isn't right to make him suffer...
<s> Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
<s> You!
<s> No thanks.
<s> Weekend after next...
<s> Be honest, I can't say I did it all myself. My grandma helped me get the words right.
<s> I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?
<s> Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?
<s> Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess.  What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?
<s> What does that mean?
<s> You want to go to a movie tonight?
<s> I'm okay... I'm okay.
<s> I want to see Pilgrim.
<s> YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
<s> You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!!
<s> We still have a way to go.
<s> Yeah, cool.
<s> Waste the dude.
<s> See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
<s> Dragon book. Compiler design.
<s> Shh!
<s> I want it.
<s> ...as they snoop onto us.
<s> Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
<s> Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run.  I mean... Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look...  "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers!
<s> Cereal.
<s> Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
<s> Revenge.
<s> Blow me.
<s> Razor and Blade.
<s> How did you know that?
<s> Burn!
<s> I said give me time.
<s> What?
<s> It's cool, I'm just looking.
<s> The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
<s> Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
<s> This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
<s> I'll hack the Gibson.
<s> It's my subway defense system.
<s> Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
<s> The rabbit is in the administration system.
<s> Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
<s> Virus?
<s> Congratulations.
<s> Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
<s> So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
<s> Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
<s> Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
<s> For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
<s> How many people in the bus?
<s> Sure ain't. Martians could land on Ben's doorstep, all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.
<s> Got it Earl.
<s> Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
<s> I don't want to.
<s> You bet.
<s> He's coming to get me Rachel.
<s> This is great Rachel. Come on.
<s> Hi.
<s> Jamie?
<s> Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
<s> Least I'm not alone.
<s> They didn't know what they were fighting.
<s> Right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs.  Brady, you know how to use a gun?
<s> Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
<s> Apocalypse, end of the world, Armageddon. Its always got a face and a name.
<s> Hi, Dad. What happened?
<s> You blame everything on kids.
<s> We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
<s> I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
<s> I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me...
<s> I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
<s> Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
<s> He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
<s> He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
<s> And I can't keep you interested?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
<s> Sure.
<s> Sure. Sure.
<s> Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
<s> I don't like that story.
<s> And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
<s> I promise.
<s> It's the bogyman, isn't it?
<s> Was it the bogyman?
<s> I'm wasting time.
<s> Are there any special instructions?
<s> He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."
<s> You want to see some?
<s> Oh, is that what it is?
<s> Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
<s> Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
<s> I'm an architect.
<s> You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
<s> No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.
<s> Yeah.  It's kind of a weird place, actually.  A lotta wall space. 
<s> Oh, what, in this section of town?
<s> Oh, God.
<s> Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
<s> Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
<s> I'm...all right.
<s> No, I don't think so.
<s> And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you.
<s> Oh, that's nice.
<s> Yes, he's just adorable.
<s> Did you ever read this one--?
<s> I have been in love with you for so long.
<s> What do you expect me to say?
<s> I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
<s> Aren't they great?
<s> Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I forgot.
<s> Was I?
<s> I don't know.
<s> But, you got four children!
<s> I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
<s> Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.
<s> Get his wine away.
<s> Always.
<s> We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
<s> It's on the table, Dad.
<s> Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
<s> Because he likes you.
<s> Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
<s> Oh, Frederick!
<s> No.
<s> Who is it?
<s> But who?  Where did you meet him?
<s> Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
<s> Doesn't she look pretty?
<s> Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
<s> Why?
<s> No.
<s> I got two minutes.
<s> Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
<s> He's fine.
<s> ...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
<s> ...you know?  I, uh...
<s> Thanks, thanks.
<s> Oh!
<s> Is there no chance?
<s> Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
<s> With a, with a stranger?  With a--
<s> True.
<s> Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
<s> Someday, I'll pay it all back.
<s> Yeah.
<s> She really does, though.
<s> You know.
<s> Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money. 
<s> But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
<s> Hmm!
<s> Uh, losers!  All losers!
<s> Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
<s> It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
<s> Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I, do I put people off?
<s> Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
<s> ...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
<s> You have.
<s> I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
<s> Oh.  Oh.
<s> Oh, well.
<s> It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
<s> I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
<s> ...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
<s> I am.  You-you made my day.
<s> It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
<s> Oh, yeah?  What?
<s> Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
<s> I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
<s> You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating. 
<s> You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
<s> ...you don't have to think.
<s> ...I was <u>working</u>...
<s> Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
<s> Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
<s> It's a growth business.
<s> Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
<s> I know her by the Back.
<s> Are you <u>alright</u>...?
<s> ...would you excuse me...?
<s> Somewhere in Italy.
<s> OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
<s> ...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
<s> Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
<s> He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
<s> Try Barney Clark.
<s> Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. 
<s> ...young boys, still...?
<s> You said the <u>bad</u> news...
<s> For a consideration.
<s> I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
<s> ...should love to correct your error. 
<s> I'll have them picked up.
<s> How so?
<s> I have had the honor. 
<s> Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?
<s> Is it necessary to know?
<s> Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
<s> And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
<s> Let's get her <u>out</u> of here....
<s> What is that that smells so wonderful.
<s> ...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
<s> ...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the <u>word</u>...
<s> ...what has she done to harm you...?
<s> What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
<s> What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
<s> Do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I'm going to work.
<s> Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
<s> Oh, my <u>program</u>...
<s> Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
<s> I know it well.
<s> ...but:  this particular statue...
<s> ...a case, so, so <u>fascinating</u>, so...
<s> I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
<s> ...yes, yes, yes....
<s> No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
<s> What does <u>that</u> mean?
<s> ...would you use a small word?
<s> Yes.
<s> ...why?
<s> No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
<s> I can be a good pig. Babe. Charlotte's Web. Good pig. Watch.
<s> I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
<s> They wouldn't be a bit surprised..
<s> Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say...
<s> Wha-at?  What is it?
<s> Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
<s> Yeah, an insane female gynecologist! Hayley, don't listen to her.
<s> I didn't realize I had to declare a major.
<s> I just never thought of you in that...
<s> I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
<s> It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
<s> About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop.
<s> I'm just thinking I'm glad I broke up with everyone I ever went out with.  The swelling is gonna go down, right?
<s> Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day.
<s> Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
<s> Like last night, Veronica?
<s> Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.
<s> Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
<s> Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
<s> Heather? Wha...
<s> I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.
<s> Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
<s> You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
<s> No.
<s> Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!
<s> God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather.
<s> Give me the clipboard.
<s> I don't know. Should you?
<s> I don't really like your friends either.
<s> Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
<s> Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
<s> It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.
<s> "To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
<s> I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
<s> Incredible similarity.
<s> You must have had fun.
<s> I did not want them <u>dead</u>.
<s> Did not.
<s> You kids are making too much damn noise.
<s> You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
<s> Shut the fuck up, all right.
<s> Superb.
<s> Get a job.
<s> Is it hurting, dear?
<s> pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
<s> comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
<s> I just want to be on my own for a while.
<s> It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
<s> I don't wanna be in bloody school!
<s> Love, you can still write to each other.
<s> hurries over.
<s> stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
<s> Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
<s> Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
<s> Him . . .
<s> This . . .
<s> You're such an incredible woman.
<s> Hurry up! I'm freezing!
<s> That was what we were led to believe . . .
<s> Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
<s> I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
<s> Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
<s> Bull...
<s> Eighty third most common.
<s> What was it?
<s> If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
<s> No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
<s> Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
<s> Ambrose. I know.
<s> Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
<s> Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
<s> What?
<s> Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
<s> I'll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you've disrupted me at work.
<s> What?
<s> Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
<s> Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.
<s> Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
<s> Hey even if it is more power to ya.  Alrighty then. Have a good time.
<s> Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
<s> I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
<s> I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
<s> I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
<s> In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
<s> I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
<s> And give a deposition to the jUdge.
<s> On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything.  I can't tell him what we're up to...
<s> I got your bail continued.
<s> He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
<s> It's November.
<s> I took a loan on my car and my computer.
<s> Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.
<s> I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
<s> Mister LaPlante...
<s> 'Cause I'm up to my ass in shit is why.  I'm broke, plus I got legal problems... Nobody was asking for me, huh?
<s> My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
<s> The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
<s> Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
<s> I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
<s> Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?
<s> Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
<s> Yeah.  I'll see ya... dad.
<s> Vietnam!
<s> Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
<s> It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.
<s> Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
<s> You said all the passengers were accounted for...
<s> Quit?  She wants to quit?
<s> She can't quit.
<s> For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
<s> Never reach out!
<s> I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
<s> He's pretty... remarkable.
<s> Okay.
<s> Well, it's for a woman.
<s> Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
<s> No, no, no, no.
<s> <u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
<s> I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
<s> I was alone a lot as a child.  No one to compete with.  My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things.  When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.
<s> Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
<s> Why are you mad at each other?
<s> I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
<s> I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
<s> He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
<s> One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
<s> Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
<s> I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
<s> He wasn't there.
<s> Someone blew the whistle.  Someone hates me.
<s> Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
<s> Grow up, Dreyer.
<s> Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
<s> I didn't.
<s> Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
<s> The thermometer's broken.
<s> No.
<s> Get on the other side of that.
<s> Even cosier.
<s> Really.
<s> Not now.  I'm busy.
<s> Is that it?
<s> Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
<s> Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
<s> There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
<s> That is what bothers me.
<s> Leaving what?
<s> Then it's worth the journey.
<s> We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
<s> She's a treasure she is.
<s> I would like to say goodbye.
<s> I lied.
<s> I cannot explain.
<s> Because, it's for the best.  There are somethings that are better left unexplained.
<s> Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
<s> A lucky guess.
<s> He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
<s> Jennifer.
<s> You remind me of someone I used to know.
<s> I wanted to get to know you better.
<s> Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
<s> It will end tonight.
<s> Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
<s> What's that next to him?
<s> And this?
<s> I was working on the cataloging.
<s> We'll see.
<s> I do not know -- and even if I did...
<s> It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
<s> There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon.
<s> Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
<s> It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
<s> The best.
<s> Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
<s> He knows better than that.
<s> Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.
<s> You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
<s> We're on foot.  We can't get away.
<s> Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
<s> Like what?
<s> I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
<s> The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
<s> We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.
<s> Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
<s> Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
<s> I got the gasoline --
<s> Keeps to himself, more like.
<s> Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
<s> I think you got no choice.
<s> Where is it?
<s> Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
<s> Be quiet!  Listen!
<s> What I want is to help my father.
<s> I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
<s> Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
<s> Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
<s> What are you doing?!  Stop that!
<s> Just one question.  Please.
<s> Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
<s> I know the one.
<s> Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
<s> Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
<s> They've been in there all day.
<s> Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
<s> Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
<s> You can let go.
<s> I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!
<s> Let me see your identity card.
<s> Let me explain.
<s> There is nothing to it.
<s> How many in your family?
<s> You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
<s> No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
<s> Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.
<s> I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
<s> Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
<s> What did they say?
<s> You said you had no whiskey.
<s> After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
<s> We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
<s> Listen, you need me.
<s> I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> When will they be here?
<s> Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.
<s> Just drive, Gregoire.
<s> I saw the sign.
<s> Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
<s> Yes, sir. What is wrong?
<s> I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
<s> Call, sir?
<s> Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
<s> What cards?
<s> One thousand francs.
<s> I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
<s> Homework?
<s> I couldn't help.
<s> No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
<s> He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
<s> Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
<s> Jean Baptiste!
<s> Please go back, bring the children to us.
<s> What about us?
<s> What for Paul.
<s> No, no.
<s> A kiss.
<s> Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
<s> Go downstairs, I will help you.
<s> I'm confused.
<s> And what's Steven's status?
<s> So what stopped her?
<s> -- the whole thing is falling apart!
<s> C'mon.
<s> Ms. Marr!
<s> If this is someone's idea of a joke --
<s> Nothing.
<s> The...Fourth of July.
<s> What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
<s> Best of a nightmare.
<s> Why?
<s> That's crazy!
<s> You've got your own TV show?
<s> Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
<s> You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.
<s> Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
<s> No, no, it's just --
<s> My wife. Where were we?
<s> Maybe if I --
<s> I can't remember at the moment.
<s> I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
<s> You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
<s> Good way to get your head blown off.
<s> Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
<s> You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
<s> Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
<s> I thought you understood.... It's the souls of Vannacutt's dead... The insanity... The horror... Victims burned alive... All that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years...  ...singing this will be the day that I die... This will be the day that I....
<s> He would have been back by now.
<s> -- ten.
<s> What was her name?
<s> So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
<s> She's down...how do you mean honey?
<s> I'm ok mommy.
<s> Ok.  If you want this room, you can have it.
<s> Don't be afraid!
<s> Well, that all depends.
<s> Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
<s> I just, I don't know...
<s> Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
<s> She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
<s> So what are you saying?
<s> What's happening!
<s> Yes, I am.
<s> I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
<s> Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
<s> The amulet...
<s> It will not take long...
<s> It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
<s> Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
<s> I didn't do anything...God saved her...
<s> What?
<s> No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
<s> Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.
<s> Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
<s> I don't know ...
<s> Then tell me what to do.
<s> What happened to him?
<s> It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
<s> Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
<s> Right.
<s> Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
<s> It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
<s> God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
<s> Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale.
<s> No.  We want ...
<s> Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
<s> A prize?  For what?
<s> Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
<s> Fuck you!
<s> Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
<s> C'mon.  It'll be great.
<s> Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
<s> I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
<s> There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
<s> Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
<s> "And though he's slippery, he still gets caught."
<s> What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
<s> Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
<s> Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I...
<s> "How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
<s> I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
<s> You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
<s> George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
<s> As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor...
<s> I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An innocent man.  A thief.
<s> You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
<s> And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
<s> It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
<s> Trust Leonardo....
<s> Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
<s> Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
<s> When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
<s> That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.
<s> Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference.
<s> Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
<s> Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....
<s> You want an address on that last one?
<s> But you're going to tell us anyway...
<s> What job?
<s> The only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to <u>stop</u> me from committing crimes.  You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.
<s> You certainly do.
<s> For God's sake, chain this convict.
<s> You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.
<s> You can't, convict!  You're just a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "How could this happen to me?"  It's a natural inclination.  But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! You are on my planet!  You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!
<s> I'm supposed to fall for that?
<s> No.  But why do you let Butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt?
<s> The Hipster!
<s> The Hudswinger!
<s> We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
<s> Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
<s> Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
<s> Yeah.
<s> I know they're gonna buy that stock --
<s> But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
<s> Not at all. You're light as a feather.
<s> I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
<s> Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
<s> Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
<s> Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
<s> Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
<s> Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
<s> Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
<s> He grins wolfishly.
<s> It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
<s> I --
<s> I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
<s> We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
<s> Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.
<s> Say, that was a swell idea!
<s> Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
<s> Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
<s> '...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
<s> I --
<s> It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
<s> Ya get the special?
<s> She sits down.
<s> Old Faithful.
<s> She's damn good, Lou.
<s> Where?
<s> Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
<s> But you didn't have to come up here.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I like her already.
<s> We're half-brothers.  Paul is mother's first child.  When his father died, she married my father. Dr. Rand, the missionary.  And you know what they say about missionaries' children.
<s> Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
<s> But she's not dead, Wes.
<s> No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
<s> Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
<s> She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
<s> I imagined this so differently...
<s> And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
<s> I guess I'll wait until I'm home, Mrs. Rand.
<s> Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
<s> I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
<s> To the asylum?
<s> Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
<s> Why shouldn't she be?
<s> -- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
<s> Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
<s> That shirt?
<s> Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
<s> I know, I know. I had no idea --
<s> I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
<s> Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
<s> Ben, I don't think he wants us here.
<s> Hnnn.
<s> Libbets. Libbets Casey.
<s> Damn right, but where the hell were you?
<s> Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?
<s> Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
<s> C'mon.
<s> That's besides the point.
<s> -- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
<s> Thanks for the advice Dave.
<s> Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
<s> Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
<s> Nobody.
<s> Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner.
<s> It's not a bother.
<s> You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
<s> They say you never forget.
<s> Forget how to ride a bike.
<s> I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
<s> I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
<s> Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
<s> Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
<s> See ya.
<s> Like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they've got in this place.
<s> Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
<s> Let's see!
<s> Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
<s> Who said so?
<s> Then why'd you come after me?
<s> Watching what?
<s> Greetings, Charles.
<s> Can I come?
<s> Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
<s> What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
<s> I have to go to the bathroom.
<s> Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
<s> Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
<s> Then change it.
<s> Why?
<s> We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
<s> One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
<s> When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
<s> Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
<s> What is it?
<s> Must be tough for you.  What happened.
<s> Long as it's fun.
<s> Who?
<s> But she was an attractive girl.
<s> But you wanted to.
<s> I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
<s> There's nothing more to talk about.
<s> Then so was mine...
<s> It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
<s> Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
<s> Ah! You have questions?
<s> Nothing if not vampires...
<s> Listen to me.
<s> I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
<s> I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
<s> You let them do it.
<s> Louis, I swear I did not.
<s> I didn't realise.
<s> What you are? You would be something other than you are?
<s> And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
<s> How devilishly clever.
<s> No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
<s> So you felt it too!
<s> Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.
<s> Yes...
<s> I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
<s> Do you think so?
<s> We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
<s> Paris? You came from Paris?
<s> What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!
<s> NO!!!
<s> You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
<s> Don't try to speak... it's alright...
<s> You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
<s> Perhaps lucky for both of us.
<s> Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
<s> The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
<s> Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
<s> He did it to make you stay with him!
<s> What the hell would you call this?
<s> Phones went down a few minutes ago.
<s> Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
<s> Storm is what makes it interesting. Thass why all the fish are up. Less hook us a couple big ones.
<s> No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
<s> Yeah, right -- whatever.
<s> I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
<s> Come on, you can make it.
<s> I'm right here. Grab my hand.
<s> Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
<s> It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
<s> Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
<s> It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
<s> I'm okay.
<s> Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
<s> It beets being on the mainland.
<s> It's...him.
<s> We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.
<s> I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
<s> We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
<s> Rio, baby!
<s> We gotta get out of here. Now.
<s> How much?
<s> Must have missed the sign.
<s> So why are you still here?
<s> They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
<s> Or even spirit messages from the next world.
<s> Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
<s> I don't know now without my father.
<s> I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
<s> She has never mentioned her family.
<s> Mr. Davis seems a good prospect young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
<s> You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
<s> Miss Wollsten - my secretary, she'd know.
<s> There's no one there - nothing but the caves and the dead.
<s> It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
<s> How did she die?
<s> He hates all my race.
<s> It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
<s> I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
<s> Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
<s> What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly . . .
<s> Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.
<s> Yes, George?
<s> Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
<s> I want you to take a good look at that face.
<s> Well, wait and see.
<s> They went out of business years ago.
<s> That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
<s> Hey, look! Somebody's driving this cab.
<s> Of course it's the place.
<s> That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
<s> Want to give my flower a drink.
<s> Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
<s> Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
<s> I'm all right.
<s> Well, she's not crazy about him.
<s> Oh, George!
<s> No, sir.
<s> Don't hurt my ear again!
<s> Where's my insurance policy?  Oh, here . . .
<s> No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
<s> Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
<s> He's pretty young for that job.
<s> Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.
<s> Have a good time, son.
<s> Come on, George, let's hurry.
<s> Harry . . . Harry . . .
<s> Aw, come on. Be a sport. Just dance with her one time and you'll give her the thrill of her life.
<s> Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
<s> How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
<s> About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
<s> Yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.
<s> What is it  a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
<s> I don't like coconuts.
<s> I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
<s> In that place?
<s> Come on, tell me.
<s> Tuesday.
<s> Do you like it?
<s> Hi.
<s> To keep from being an old maid.
<s> You have no idea what's happened to me.
<s> I don't care. It's George's tux.
<s> What plates?
<s> What?
<s> But of course.
<s> Someone pop your balloon?
<s> Stop paddling!
<s> Good.  It's terrible.
<s> I hope that's the cousin.
<s> They're moving pretty fast.
<s> We better go back in.
<s> I was counting on hours.
<s> Over here!
<s> No place special.  Just hanging out.
<s> You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
<s> Sean's still out there.
<s> You said something about a camera.
<s> What else you got?
<s> Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty.  It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along.
<s> Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
<s> Come on, let's check the bite radius.
<s> Sound?
<s> And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
<s> It was bad, wasn't it.
<s> ...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
<s> I try.  Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....
<s> Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
<s> We have to do something.
<s> Two of them are still missing!
<s> Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
<s> That's it?
<s> That's what he said.
<s> 1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.
<s> No.  Find your brother, okay?
<s> You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
<s> Dad!  Dad!
<s> Oh, yeah.  So why aren't they doing it now?
<s> Great.
<s> Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
<s> Who'd you ask?
<s> You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
<s> 3:30.
<s> They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.
<s> Next week.
<s> Anything?
<s> Power line.
<s> It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out there, you know....
<s> Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
<s> Eat Cheerios.
<s> Okay, okay.  Close your door.
<s> Would you take him?
<s> He thought he had a good reason.
<s> I have to walk him till the drug wears off.
<s> No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
<s> It's easy.  Put a net on the derrick.  Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
<s> What is it, 97 days?
<s> No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
<s> We play hide and seek all the time.  They find a lot of things.
<s> That's a lot of ground to cover.
<s> Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
<s> ... Me, too.
<s> Sounds wonderful.
<s> Me, too.
<s> I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
<s> It was removed from Charlie Overman's body.
<s> This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
<s> Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
<s> ... Okay.
<s> I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
<s> Make this quick!
<s> Because I don't trust you, that's why.
<s> Still sleeping.
<s> Not good enough.
<s> Someone's looking for you.
<s> Better than catching Sean's herpes.
<s> Depends on big brother.
<s> Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it.
<s> Why you sonuvabitch...
<s> No, think of something else.
<s> Calvin said it was all right.
<s> Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
<s> Polar bears in Georgia???
<s> I'll remember that, my Lordship.
<s> Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
<s> Got a job for me?
<s> So was Dad.
<s> He needs a haircut.
<s> Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
<s> Something wrong?
<s> We're in love.
<s> Watch me, Grandma....
<s> But you always let me....
<s> Yes, I did.
<s> We need beer....
<s> But it went away...We would have known....
<s> Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
<s> Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
<s> I'm hungry, Mom....
<s> Thank you....
<s> I'm just getting started....
<s> I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
<s> It picked Sean...It killed your father....
<s> I'm fine....
<s> You're not a pain in the ass....
<s> I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....
<s> Where do I pull off...?
<s> Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
<s> Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....
<s> Just like that?
<s> Get her started....
<s> The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
<s> Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
<s> It needs more time to charge.
<s> Still chasing fish?
<s> The readings suck....
<s> I made them, man....
<s> Where the hell's the beer...?
<s> What?
<s> Don't say anything about this to my mother....
<s> When I signed on....
<s> You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again....
<s> I didn't ask you to....
<s> I'm going down, Jake....
<s> You don't like my voice...?
<s> Screw you, Jake....
<s> I've got to get to her....
<s> I'm the one who wanted to study it....
<s> I told you....
<s> "Welcome to Eureka."
<s> A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa ..
<s> What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
<s> I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> ..
<s> No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.
<s> I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
<s> Listen to me saying what?
<s> I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
<s> I'm going up to the institute.
<s> Bits.
<s> Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
<s> Cut your own throat, you're ner- vous about it, tend to hesitate. He's got three trial cuts, lower left side of the neck, before he works up courage for the big one.
<s> Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June.
<s> Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
<s> My hands?
<s> No.
<s> Yes.
<s> I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
<s> He said that? What else did he say?
<s> Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
<s> Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
<s> I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
<s> I can't identify him ..
<s> I don't want them to arrest you.
<s> Grateful for your candor, Sir.
<s> Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
<s> No, Sergeant, I got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..
<s> You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
<s> Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
<s> Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
<s> Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
<s> Ugh!
<s> I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
<s> No.
<s> You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
<s> Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
<s> Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
<s> Hmm.  Pretty good.
<s> Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
<s> Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
<s> And I am...
<s> Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
<s> Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
<s> Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
<s> ...my soul or something. _ 117.
<s> I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
<s> Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
<s> Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
<s> Denver got very silent about a day ago.  San Diego's got a fever for Cush.  This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft.  People get crazy.  And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight.  Million.
<s> I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
<s> Okay.
<s> Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
<s> You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
<s> Another drink please.
<s> That's your word?
<s> Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
<s> Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?
<s> You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
<s> Oh, we gonna be friends now?
<s> Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
<s> I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
<s> I missed ya.  What can I say?
<s> "Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
<s> The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
<s> I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
<s> Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
<s> A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
<s> He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
<s> This is how you play God.
<s> He's this way.
<s> When did you have it last?
<s> Think.
<s> Sure.
<s> We'll be broke in four weeks.
<s> KEEP GOING!
<s> Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
<s> I try not to.
<s> In Costa Rica?
<s> Then we go home?
<s> I want to be an astronaut.
<s> Something must've scared them.
<s> No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
<s> That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
<s> Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
<s> John . . .
<s> -humidity, I know.  Highest lead density on the market.
<s> Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
<s> I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
<s> I don't even know this woman.
<s> My vacation is over in a week.
<s> That was about a year ago.
<s> I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
<s> Isn't it obvious?
<s> Why?
<s> I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
<s> You're going too?
<s> No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
<s> I don't know.
<s> DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
<s> What's that?
<s> Feeling a bit blue, are we?
<s> Why should they?
<s> That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change.
<s> They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
<s> You think this is all a joke?
<s> Oh, no!
<s> That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
<s> Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.
<s> Stop the program!  Stop the program!
<s> You're sure we have to?
<s> Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
<s> Where did the vehicles stop?
<s> I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
<s> Uh - - about two million.
<s> The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.
<s> Six weeks?
<s> That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... 
<s> Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
<s> They smell.
<s> They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
<s> Small versions of adults, honey.
<s> - - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
<s> I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
<s> The other car!
<s> They're not here.
<s> Stick to my heels.
<s> And scary.
<s> Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.
<s> And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
<s> Please - - chance it.
<s> Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
<s> He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
<s> What are we looking for?
<s> I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
<s> In a box under my seat.
<s> Listen, ahh - -
<s> Yes it is.
<s> Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to three.
<s> Not without massive sequence gaps!
<s> You have no idea.
<s> Why?
<s> No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
<s> Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
<s> Who?
<s> What does he mean by "target audience"?
<s> After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
<s> It's safe.
<s> I'll stay awake.
<s> Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
<s> I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
<s> Thanks for the presents.
<s> Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
<s> Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
<s> We're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. And the perception is that Crystal Lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  That, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.
<s> Some kind of emergency back at the Sheriff's Station. Four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... I don't know what's going on, but they're panicking back there.
<s> What?
<s> He doesn't look like he's going anywhere, Bill. And if necessary, I can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private.
<s> I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed.
<s> I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.
<s> Me too. I'm drunk.
<s> That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
<s> Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
<s> _Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
<s> What was the matter with it?
<s> The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.
<s> I don't know what you could have read.
<s> I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
<s> Success or nothing?
<s> No, I left it in his office.
<s> Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
<s> -- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.
<s> No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
<s> I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
<s> I know.
<s> Yes.
<s> The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
<s> Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
<s> Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
<s> He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
<s> I've heard of it happening.
<s> I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
<s> There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
<s> Eight -- and seven months.
<s> What makes you think so?
<s> That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
<s> I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
<s> Close only by virtue of antithesis.
<s> When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...
<s> Lying in the gutter where they belong.
<s> Yes.  Isn't it there?
<s> He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
<s> You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
<s> Oskar.
<s> I photographed it extensively, father.
<s> Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
<s> No!
<s> Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
<s> We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
<s> Yeah.
<s> Compassion.
<s> Please, if he sees you, he won't come!
<s> Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
<s> Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
<s> Here please.
<s> Like for you to look for the man.
<s> Yes -- all right --
<s> Will you let me go then?
<s> Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
<s> He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
<s> How would I remember?
<s> Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
<s> -- OK --
<s> Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
<s> Well, let's go down and ask him.
<s> Well --
<s> Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
<s> How?
<s> What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
<s> We did this before.
<s> I don't like getting splashed.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What?
<s> I was wondering what that was.
<s> My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.
<s> With Trina.
<s> Trask wants to talk with you.
<s> Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
<s> Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
<s> Well as a matter of --
<s> Yeah, two things Pete, that --
<s> No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
<s> Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
<s> I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?
<s> Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
<s> She told me.
<s> Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
<s> I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
<s> We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
<s> I left them here. I was doing some work here.
<s> No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
<s> Klute offered us his services; we've accepted.
<s> Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well --
<s> Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly.  At the moment I am seeing no one.
<s> Detroit.
<s> In real life when does he hit you?
<s> Show...
<s> That's right.  You're absolutely right...It's been a long time since I made French toast.
<s> I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
<s> Uh, huh?
<s> I do not, your honor, however--
<s> I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.
<s> Objection!
<s> I suppose...
<s> Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.
<s> Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
<s> I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
<s> He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
<s> I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
<s> Are you firing me, Jim?
<s> Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
<s> Kramer...
<s> Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
<s> I don't know, John...I mean, to be brutally honest, I'm not so sure what kind of mental shape Joanna's in right now.  Y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink.
<s> Do you want the kid or don't you?
<s> Ted?  Are you there?
<s> OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
<s> Ted, don't be so hostile.
<s> Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
<s> Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
<s> Maybe.  I said maybe.  What I mean is, ah...I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so...
<s> Yes. I am ready.
<s> Do not worry, Holiness. They fight for you. They are under your protection.
<s> Again?
<s> No cried?
<s> Here. We'll collect them.
<s> You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
<s> It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
<s> To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
<s> General Chiang.
<s> Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
<s> Yes, but they say he did.
<s> Yes.
<s> Then, we shall meet.
<s> Answer. 
<s> So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
<s> Can India help us?
<s> Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have.
<s> Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
<s> The people will not allow it.
<s> I will not go.
<s> We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
<s> Thank you.
<s> I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
<s> He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
<s> You decide.
<s> I have smarter men.
<s> You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
<s> But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
<s> The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
<s> Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
<s> It is a difficult situation.
<s> The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
<s> Cocktail?
<s> Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
<s> What the hell are you doing?!!
<s> You're crawling around like a--
<s> I coulda shot you, you--
<s> They don't really attack underwater and--
<s> Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
<s> 'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
<s> I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
<s> Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
<s> Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
<s> Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
<s> Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
<s> That hurt my feelings.
<s> 'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
<s> Yeah.  Thanks to you.
<s> Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
<s> Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
<s> It's okay.
<s> <u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
<s> Look.
<s> Alright, Jack!
<s> Okay.
<s> You wouldn't?
<s> Keep firing!
<s> Yeah.
<s> Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
<s> Where is he?!
<s> Did he say anything?
<s> Well.  At wakes.
<s> Seconds.  Three, four.
<s> Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
<s> They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
<s> Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 
<s> <u>That</u> was a bust.
<s> Look.
<s> I guess.
<s> Kelly--
<s> It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
<s> Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
<s> Why not?
<s> 'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
<s> Where?
<s> NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
<s> How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
<s> Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
<s> It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
<s> Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
<s> To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
<s> Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?
<s> They weren't there. Get close-ups.
<s> It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
<s> I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
<s> Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
<s> Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
<s> "We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
<s> All that detail, just from memory...?
<s> Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
<s> You're a tough one, aren't you?
<s> Then please - do this test for me.
<s> Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
<s> I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
<s> That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
<s> I don't know. Is it?
<s> Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
<s> I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
<s> Killed outright?
<s> Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
<s> A cattle ranch?
<s> Yes, Doctor. Please.
<s> I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
<s> I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?
<s> No fair! You lured him with produce.
<s> We leave in the morning?!
<s> Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
<s> Maybe...
<s> ...never doubt what you are doing.
<s> "Some"?
<s> He delivered no such message.
<s> No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
<s> Do not let gratitude get in the way...
<s> Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers...
<s> The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
<s> ...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
<s> And what is that?
<s> Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
<s> Webb's at Edward?
<s> Fire!!!
<s> Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
<s> La victoire.
<s> Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
<s> Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
<s> He did.
<s> I'm not a doctor.
<s> And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
<s> The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
<s> Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
<s> Crunch...Implosion.
<s> Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
<s> I got hung up!  Try this!
<s> Shit...
<s> Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
<s> After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
<s> Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
<s> Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of---
<s> It bit me!
<s> Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
<s> Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
<s> Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
<s> It shouldn't be a long delay.
<s> Timex...
<s> It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
<s> Hook's on 24...
<s> He's tanking on us...
<s> Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
<s> What are you going to do to him?
<s> It's had a meal.
<s> "Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
<s> Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
<s> Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
<s> The good doctor signed our death warrant.
<s> Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
<s> Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
<s> Well, it's still a good idea.
<s> Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
<s> I'll think of something, don't worry.
<s> I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.
<s> Like antiques.
<s> No Harry, you can't.
<s> I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
<s> Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
<s> Furry muff, let's go.
<s> Er well, yes we do.
<s> Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.
<s> Just give me the keys.
<s> Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
<s> Invitations?
<s> Hit the fuckers.
<s> Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!
<s> It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.
<s> All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
<s> Well, perhaps you can help?
<s> Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
<s> Get your fingers out of my soup!
<s> You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
<s> It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
<s> Nick the Greek.
<s> When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
<s> I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
<s> Six.
<s> Just shut up.
<s> I can't take any more school.
<s> They stole our land--
<s> You think I can't learn that?
<s> I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
<s> No, sir--
<s> Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
<s> They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
<s> Thank you, Sergeant Major.
<s> Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
<s> Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
<s> Yeah, this is Skinny.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Colt Peacemaker.
<s> Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.
<s> I roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is "Yo trabajo para Jimmy Herrera."
<s> You little pissant--
<s> Do I seem jumpy?
<s> Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
<s> No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
<s> Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
<s> Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
<s> Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
<s> But they were Indians themselves.
<s> No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
<s> I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
<s> By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
<s> "Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"
<s> You own this place?
<s> Made some money, came back here--
<s> Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
<s> We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
<s> Maybe.
<s> She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
<s> I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
<s> Pleased to meet you.
<s> Good deal you were born down here, then.
<s> Have we had trouble there before?
<s> I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
<s> Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
<s> Bandidos, Injuns--
<s> Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
<s> No te molestas. Tenemos a ella. [Don't worry. We've got her.]
<s> That Buddy was a cool breeze.
<s> --Santiago.
<s> Buddy Deeds--
<s> Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
<s> Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
<s> Maybe you're just getting less patient.
<s> Well, you hire illegals--
<s> No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
<s> I don't mean Fernando.
<s> I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
<s> Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
<s> It's Saturday.
<s> Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
<s> Enough with the clothes--
<s> I thought he busted you a couple times.
<s> I can't name anybody she does like these days.
<s> Most people did, yeah.
<s> I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Two years.
<s> Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
<s> Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
<s> Gotta be in person.
<s> They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
<s> Well, it's a complicated issue--
<s> Yeah. It's quiet--
<s> Hell of a spot to put a business.
<s> Another woman?
<s> Payne.
<s> Thirty-five bucks.
<s> You heard right.
<s> My life was too weird for her.
<s> doorway) And who's that?
<s> Why would I do that?
<s> I told you --
<s> What is he?
<s> You don't?
<s> But obviously you still care what happens to him.
<s> Do you?
<s> Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
<s> Why?  Because he had you?
<s> Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
<s> Why don't you tell me the truth?
<s> I'm sure.  He's dead.
<s> Quaid and Jennifer--
<s> I think so.
<s> Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
<s> I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
<s> He got up and walked.
<s> For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
<s> What about Swann's miracles?
<s> We've never met.
<s> Maybe I just bought it.
<s> You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
<s> I don't think the dead much care.
<s> What for?  You need to stay busy?
<s> Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
<s> We've got to get you to a hospital.
<s> Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
<s> Does anybody?
<s> At birth.  I don't know you --
<s> Sure.  Vivovich.
<s> You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
<s> Now I'm going to have to kill you.
<s> Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
<s> And you're not?
<s> Is that all?
<s> And you believed him?
<s> I got to go.  I'm late.
<s> He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
<s> No!
<s> You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
<s> Two years.
<s> You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
<s> Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
<s> No, how about you?
<s> Hi, Charlie.
<s> Do you want to have some breakfast?
<s> How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
<s> I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
<s> Ok, whatever you want.
<s> We established that we have no communication.
<s> Fuck off.
<s> We should get you to the doctor.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No, we'll find something around here.
<s> A coke.
<s> That's what you said the other night.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Oh?
<s> Yes?
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
<s> Good-night.
<s> Alright?
<s> Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
<s> It's Lydia, your wife.
<s> Fine. Is it going ok?
<s> Zoe, come say hello to your father...
<s> Do you want I send it to your room?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Why do you have to defend her?
<s> I got some hair stuff.
<s> Bye.
<s> It'll just be a few days.
<s> Sure.
<s> Hmmm.
<s> No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
<s> Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the "stop" button?
<s> I don't know.  What are they?
<s> Must be a spare set.
<s> Yes.  It's exactly...
<s> And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
<s> I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
<s> Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
<s> This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
<s> I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
<s> You heard voices, you know you did.
<s> He will.  He has great faith.
<s> I hope so.
<s> You ready?
<s> You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
<s> Father, I'm right here.
<s> Kelson, hold on a second...
<s> How many weeks are you honey/
<s> What's his name?
<s> You just call?
<s> Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
<s> Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
<s> On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
<s> That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
<s> Peter, please...
<s> Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too.
<s> I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
<s> I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
<s> We're going to do this.
<s> That's true.
<s> I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
<s> I know who he is.
<s> We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
<s> I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
<s> You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
<s> No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
<s> There weren't any voices.
<s> Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
<s> Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
<s> Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
<s> Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
<s> Nothing.
<s> What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
<s> The blue.
<s> Oh, sorry.
<s> He's in college?
<s> You lost your head.
<s> Chances are there's still a chance.
<s> I just can.
<s> My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
<s> He works at a bank.
<s> I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
<s> So that means I have to ride with you.
<s> Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
<s> That what you think?
<s> It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
<s> You do see me standing here, right?
<s> I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
<s> You're not stupid.
<s> What's up?
<s> You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
<s> Hey, what's up.
<s> The "man" again.
<s> Talk to your new girlfriend.
<s> What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
<s> I'm not asking for us to be together.
<s> I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
<s> No.
<s> Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
<s> Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
<s> Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
<s> Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
<s> Why do you keep asking me that?
<s> Find.
<s> Then why are you so upset?
<s> Better late than never, right?
<s> I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
<s> At one in the morning?
<s> Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
<s> Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
<s> I mean, it's not true, is it?
<s> No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
<s> A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the "Clips."  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me.
<s> Shut it.  Shut yer fuckin' mouth.
<s> Alright, so I'm gonna transfer you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do --
<s> I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
<s> LAPD. Open the door.
<s> I'm sorry, I had to get dressed.
<s> Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
<s> Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
<s> And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?
<s> Who was it?
<s> Bit messy.
<s> Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
<s> We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
<s> Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
<s> What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
<s> I'm sorry --
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> ok.
<s> That was so great what you just said.
<s> I've got troubles.
<s> Wanna kiss me, Jim?
<s> I won't say, no, wait, Claudia --
<s> please, what is it, please --
<s> It doesn't matter.
<s> They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
<s> Sure, why?
<s> If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
<s> You don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok?
<s> They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
<s> I'm a rapper.
<s> I ain't fuckin with you --
<s> Alright, alright, cut it, coolio. That's enough with the mouth and the language.
<s> He's doing the interview with the lady --
<s> Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
<s> Well --
<s> A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
<s> -- Samuel Johnson.
<s> "The" cause of dullness in others --
<s> Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
<s> Stay that way.
<s> Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
<s> I'm trying.
<s> She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
<s> She loves you.
<s> Yeah.
<s> How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
<s> It's ok.
<s> Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
<s> Graduation?
<s> -- let's talk more about your background --
<s> Yes.
<s> I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
<s> I'm quietly judging you.
<s> people die.
<s> Not a problem.
<s> ...this close...
<s> Quietly, slow down, whoa --
<s> No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here?
<s> Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
<s> Ok. What's your name?
<s> What's this, how did this happen?
<s> It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
<s> Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?
<s> THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
<s> THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
<s> Then what?
<s> Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
<s> Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
<s> I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!
<s> I'm sorry, Stanley.
<s> Love you too..
<s> Yeah.
<s> Paula.  Ellen.
<s> No one else that I know?
<s> How long with Ellen?
<s> What about now?
<s> Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
<s> <u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
<s> Hello.  Is Claudia here?
<s> Yes.  What's your name?
<s> Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
<s> ....it's alright....
<s> Hi.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Um, no, y'know what? Forget the water, just give me a loaf of bread...white bread.
<s> And um....do you have Swank magazine?
<s> Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
<s> Sure.
<s> I'm fine. nothing.
<s> Alright.
<s> Hi.
<s> I have money.
<s> I understand you saved my son's life today.
<s> Nothing... Nothing.
<s> I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
<s> Soon enough.  Here we are.
<s> Come, we have a boat waiting.
<s> A body.
<s> Tomorrow.
<s> Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
<s> You grow fond of him.  That's good.
<s> The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
<s> You said you'd do anything, Athos, anything to replace this King.  So do it.
<s> It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!
<s> You're a fool!
<s> So what has changed?
<s> You can't do it.
<s> Everyone back.
<s> Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
<s> I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
<s> So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
<s> Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.
<s> None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
<s> Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
<s> It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
<s> Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
<s> Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
<s> I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
<s> You trust his character more than anyone else does.
<s> An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
<s> I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
<s> There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
<s> No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
<s> She will be at the ball.
<s> I decided it this morning.
<s> In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love.
<s> There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
<s> You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
<s> Yes, your Majesty.
<s> ... You knew you had a double?
<s> They have plotted against me!  Me! The embodiment of God's will!
<s> Thank you, Keeper.
<s> No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
<s> Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
<s> Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.
<s> Raoul... is in love...
<s> I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
<s> We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
<s> Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
<s> Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
<s> So what?
<s> Where are you?
<s> Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
<s> But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
<s> When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
<s> Did you start out area six?
<s> That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
<s> It's just...catching up with me, you know?
<s> It wasn't in the cards.
<s> Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
<s> No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
<s> Seattle.
<s> You'll find out - soon enough.
<s> I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Jim Trudell!  Bravo company!
<s> This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
<s> 1490...Breckinridge...
<s> I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change, I guess.
<s> It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
<s> Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
<s> Not with this...
<s> Where is he?
<s> I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
<s> I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
<s> His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
<s> That's when it happened?
<s> Could he handle a direct contact?
<s> Twenty minutes max.
<s> Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
<s> Somebody hurt him?
<s> What do you want to do?
<s> Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
<s> VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
<s> Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
<s> You wanna watch this or what?!
<s> Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
<s> He had to.
<s> Are your parking permits in the computer? He drives a van.
<s> This is our boy...!
<s> Stay in the trees.
<s> Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
<s> Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
<s> In eight days.
<s> You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
<s> I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
<s> Me.
<s> The Tooth...
<s> Was I in an accident?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yeah. It's right here.
<s> No.
<s> Why do you think I called?
<s> Cut the general crap.
<s> That's true.
<s> Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
<s> Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
<s> What's average?
<s> What about the dog?
<s> What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
<s> Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
<s> Blue, then.
<s> I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
<s> You got a deal...
<s> I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
<s> My name's Will Graham. I...
<s> In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
<s> You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
<s> You had disadvantages.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
<s> You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
<s> It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
<s> Yes.
<s> But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
<s> Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
<s> That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
<s> Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good way of breaking the ice.  That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
<s> No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
<s> Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
<s> I'm here, ain't I?
<s> They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
<s> I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
<s> You're a wimp.
<s> What?!?
<s> She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
<s> Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!
<s> Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
<s> I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
<s> Why??  I... I attend every year.
<s> It is apparently not working.
<s> But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
<s> Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!
<s> Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
<s> I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
<s> What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
<s> Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga.
<s> They're gonna lynch him!
<s> See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about!  Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!
<s> We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
<s> And you are?
<s> I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
<s> Oh, God.
<s> It's Choi.
<s> Two grand.
<s> I don't know... My computer...
<s> Hear what?
<s> An accident?!
<s> Goddamnit!
<s> Stand up and see for yourself.
<s> There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.
<s> You could say that.
<s> A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
<s> She would say she knows enough.
<s> Yes.
<s> Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
<s> Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
<s> He is the One.  He is the One!
<s> Why?
<s> That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
<s> Are you worried?
<s> No.
<s> I'm going in after him.
<s> I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
<s> I can't!
<s> Sounds good.
<s> Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you.
<s> I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
<s> Kennedy.
<s> Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
<s> Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
<s> There won't be any this week.
<s> Didn't show up.
<s> Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
<s> Did you see them run!
<s> It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
<s> How?
<s> That'll help you out fine.  That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this.  You understand?  I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out. 
<s> I understand.
<s> Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
<s> Me?  I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie...
<s> I don't understand, where's Groppi?
<s> You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
<s> Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
<s> How much was the original loan again?
<s> No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
<s> You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
<s> What did he do?
<s> No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
<s> Charlie...?
<s> You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
<s> No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
<s> Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
<s> I know...I know.
<s> Yeah, I think so.
<s> Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
<s> You ate?
<s> And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
<s> Hi, Allison --
<s> Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
<s> Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
<s> I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
<s> And you could care less --
<s> Who?
<s> Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
<s> You know what I'm saying, Joe?
<s> Both.
<s> Right away.
<s> Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
<s> Yeah.  Goodnight.
<s> Am I not obligated to?
<s> Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?
<s> Then why did you bring it up?
<s> Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
<s> Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
<s> For how long?  And why?
<s> If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
<s> Don't you want to hear the details?
<s> Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
<s> Thanks, Quince.
<s> Well, that's very interesting.
<s> Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
<s> Mine, too.
<s> She knows you real self?
<s> Yes?
<s> I didn't know that.
<s> What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?
<s> Peanut butter.
<s> Do you love Drew?
<s> Yes?
<s> How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?
<s> Yes.
<s> I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
<s> It comforts you, doesn't it?
<s> It was everything.
<s> Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
<s> How beautiful.
<s> I loved it.
<s> I love you in an evening gown.
<s> Then don't.
<s> We know all that we need to know --
<s> Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
<s> 'Love will find out the way'.
<s> I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him.
<s> It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
<s> Good night to you, Bill.
<s> Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
<s> And I won't tell anyone who you are.
<s> That's what everybody says.
<s> That's what everybody says.
<s> I understand.
<s> You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
<s> Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
<s> Why didn't you stop me?
<s> I'm her father!
<s> Yes?
<s> I was just asking, Bill.
<s> Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
<s> I'll take it from here --  I am --
<s> '...Yes --'
<s> Speak up, please.
<s> There's going to be plenty of time for that.
<s> What the hell is this?  Who are you?
<s> Yes, Bill.  The question.
<s> Next week?
<s> Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard.  Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.
<s> Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
<s> Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
<s> Hi, honey.
<s> ...Then don't.
<s> What were you going to say?
<s> Don't get dirty, Dad --
<s> Bravo.
<s> Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
<s> Yeah, it's good to get together.
<s> When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
<s> Yes, but --
<s> The fireworks are about to start.
<s> What's the way?
<s> I could be her.
<s> It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
<s> I think I know her.
<s> From what?
<s> That's it.
<s> I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
<s> That must suck. All... backwards.				 *
<s> As requested.
<s> Hi, Leonard.
<s> Don't be too hard on yourself.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Interested in buying one?
<s> What the fuck are you doing here?
<s> Don't say anything else.
<s> You told me.
<s> Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
<s> Yeah. You?
<s> Kill him.
<s> Who did he go to meet?
<s> Somebody's come. Already.
<s> Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
<s> Get rid of Dodd for me.
<s> * John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *
<s> Don't just waltz in here dressed like			  * that and order a beer.						  *
<s> What are you here for?
<s> Who's your boyfriend?
<s> You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
<s> Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
<s> I enjoy it.
<s> You know it?
<s> I don't remember.
<s> Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
<s> The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
<s> Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
<s> Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
<s> Probably left it in your room.
<s> He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
<s> What's wrong with this one?
<s> Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
<s> Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
<s> That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
<s> Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead.
<s> Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
<s> I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   * Jimmy down there.
<s> Yes, I will.
<s> To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many		    * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
<s> Then that's it.  Change the mission statement. Crockett stays in.  He keeps working up the ladder.  The local importers get a pass for the time being.
<s> You can't.
<s> Two main players plus three.
<s> I'm a fiend for mojitas.
<s> It goes very fast.
<s> You do business in Cuba with your husband?
<s> That's right.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
<s> Why?
<s> Do I need it?
<s> I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
<s> Skin has to touch skin.  That's the requirement for the warrant.  Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...
<s> The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
<s> Something's wrong.
<s> White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...
<s> That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
<s> What kind of weight?
<s> Port-Au-Prince.
<s> Who knows...
<s> As in...?
<s> "Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
<s> To recruit you.
<s> How will it stand up?
<s> Where's Riccardo?
<s> Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
<s> ...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
<s> Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
<s> The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.
<s> Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
<s> Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
<s> Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
<s> It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
<s> Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
<s> For what?
<s> Whatsa matter now?
<s> What's that supposed to mean?
<s> So you could sleep! I mean Christ!
<s> I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!
<s> The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
<s> He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall.
<s> Walk? Naturally I can walk.
<s> You just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule.
<s> What?
<s> Yessir, I can see that.
<s> Gonna be like money from home.
<s> Instant V-goddam-D.
<s> Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
<s> Ziat!
<s> Shit.
<s> Sure.
<s> Not far. Just a little way.
<s> Beats working.
<s> ...She was on the plane.
<s> About as good as it looks.
<s> A hundred grams.
<s> That doesn't seem so bad.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> After we're outside the kogus?
<s> Yeah? Where?
<s> What?
<s> I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
<s> If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
<s> You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
<s> Just do it!
<s> Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
<s> How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...
<s> "...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
<s> Manny...
<s> Don't get kinky here...
<s> I'll be late.
<s> No such thing, baby.
<s> Susan, we're not b-
<s> It didn't bite me.
<s> The scent won't last...
<s> That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
<s> She used a baster.
<s> What is it?
<s> Anything you can tell me might help.
<s> But you didn't even taste your cocoa.
<s> I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...
<s> How long...?
<s> Following me?
<s> Nothing.
<s> The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
<s> Then the roads are open...
<s> Misery?
<s> I'm getting to believe you.
<s> Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
<s> You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
<s> No, just the paper will be fine.
<s> Yeah, yeah...
<s> The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
<s> What?
<s> I'm glad you like it.
<s> Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.
<s> He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
<s> What thing?
<s> Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
<s> G'bye, Ms. Sindell.
<s> So do I...
<s> Buster.
<s> You're still a writer.
<s> Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
<s> No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
<s> Did they win?
<s> How do you that.
<s> 'Thief in the Night?'
<s> Yeah.  Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..
<s> Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind.
<s> Sit down.  You'll be a billionaire.  Better than being broke.  I've got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies standing in line.  Ball's in your court, Mr. McCloy.
<s> Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.
<s> You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
<s> Why, you going to make me a better offer?
<s> Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl.
<s> She wouldn't  be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt.  from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me.  Ball's in your court, Hunt.  What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer.
<s> What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?
<s> Exactly where is she?
<s> Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
<s> Uh-huh?
<s> Far right.
<s> Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
<s> At least you walked.
<s> Your help?  What are you talking about?
<s> I'd like a little more conviction..
<s> Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?
<s> Just like old times.
<s> Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
<s> I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
<s> I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
<s> Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
<s> Like?
<s> Then you do think it was Ambrose.
<s> The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
<s> Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.
<s> Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
<s> You mean it'll be difficult.
<s> But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
<s> In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
<s> Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm sorry..'  - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.
<s> All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building.
<s> I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out.
<s> 'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
<s> Yes, Anatoly, yes.
<s> S.O.P..
<s> May take a little time.
<s> Krieger.
<s> We got it.  On your feet.
<s> No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
<s> What happened to Jim?
<s> Take off your God damn coat!
<s> No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
<s> You don't think we're going to make it.
<s> Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
<s> My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- dont know
<s> Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
<s> Why was there another team?
<s> Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
<s> Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
<s> But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
<s> Information.
<s> Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
<s> I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
<s> Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
<s> I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
<s> Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
<s> Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
<s> It doesnt, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
<s> Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
<s> Bank?
<s> My contact is extremely shy.
<s> What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
<s> If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
<s> No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
<s> About two hundred yards from the bridge.
<s> - and picked us up in the States -
<s> I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Im dead and gone.  God knows what shes had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
<s> Dont flatter yourself - six was for <u>Eastern Europe</u>.  You made a lousy deal - ten for the world?  What is that?  But I needed you for the transfer with Max.  I got a little extra change;  and you got a little extra too.
<s> Ethan - Ive always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you.
<s> Loud and clear.
<s> Its not working.
<s> I always check the batteries.
<s> You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
<s> What?
<s> I'm going to bed now.
<s> Yes.
<s> No. You were there.
<s> You did this once it didn't work out.
<s> And what did they say?
<s> I like your dress.  It's very bright.
<s> You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
<s> Stupid.
<s> You think so?
<s> I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
<s> You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
<s> Don't just become excited.
<s> You ruined my life.
<s> Marc Chagall. A Russian.
<s> I think that's it.
<s> Yeah. It smells like snow.
<s> I was.
<s> Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
<s> Hi.
<s> Johnny.
<s> Maybe you're right.
<s> I shouldn't.
<s> On the floor?
<s> You have a brother?
<s> How was your plane ride?
<s> Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.
<s> Loretta, I can't marry you.
<s> Where's the ring?
<s> Pop don't like Johnny.
<s> I got married before, you didn't sell.
<s> She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
<s> No more he's not.
<s> It was a miracle.
<s> None of your business.
<s> What do you do?
<s> Why do men chase women?
<s> Oh.
<s> WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
<s> Through ... We found them.
<s> We don't have a lord.
<s> Ni!  Ni!  Ni ... Peng ... Nee ... Wum!
<s> Now - go!
<s> I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
<s> No, it isn't.
<s> Course I have.
<s> Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
<s> Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
<s> |      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
<s> There are some who call me Tim?
<s> Greetings King Arthur.
<s> I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
<s> Yes, I can help you with your guest.
<s> What?
<s> Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
<s> I'm getting better!
<s> When's your next round?
<s> That's all right.  See you on Thursday.
<s> Thank you, sir, most kind ...
<s> I think I could pull through, sir.
<s> Oh ... that's awfully nice.
<s> But, Father, I don't really want any of that.
<s> Got it?
<s> What is your name, handsome knight?
<s> Sir Galahad!!
<s> I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
<s> Why?
<s> Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
<s> No, no, we must find the Grail.
<s> I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.
<s> Did I tell you?  Did you listen to me?  Oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  The names you called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
<s> I didn't.
<s> You work the system right, you could ask her yourself.  Just be thankful you're not working for Household.  The Queen never lets them out of her sight.  But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy.
<s> I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.  I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping me now.
<s> They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
<s> Aye.
<s> I hope to go up next year.
<s> Out of my way!
<s> It's so infernally cold in here.
<s> It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
<s> Yes.  I do.
<s> You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
<s> Is that the Queen's request?
<s> We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even you.
<s> A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
<s> I'm not married.
<s> I wouldn't know.
<s> What I do, I do for my Queen.
<s> Maybe, once.
<s> But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
<s> She's well, too.
<s> I'm glad of it.
<s> Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
<s> Who by?
<s> What does he know about the Highlands?
<s> I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
<s> Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> The question is, do we need her?
<s> My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
<s> Excellent!
<s> Of course.
<s> I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
<s> I understand he was in a fight.
<s> I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
<s> What is it?
<s> Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond as fast as you can.  But what can I do for you?
<s> Sure.
<s> How do you do that?
<s> And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
<s> There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
<s> What the hell does that mean?
<s> Hey, kid.
<s> Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
<s> I'm in the middle of it...
<s> Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
<s> It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.
<s> It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.
<s> No way.
<s> It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
<s> We can't...
<s> Nick, what is it.
<s> A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
<s> Yes I am...
<s> We're actually inside, aren't we?
<s> I just thought of something.  If we came back from the game...  ...what if ARCADE did too?
<s> And then keep on driving?
<s> The game will guide you.
<s> Give her a chance, will you?
<s> I'm going home. I'll call you later.
<s> You're broke!
<s> I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
<s> Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
<s> And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
<s> You gotta be kidding?
<s> I'm just offering a place to stay.
<s> I'll speak to someone.
<s> That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
<s> Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
<s> It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
<s> Right. See ya.
<s> I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
<s> Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
<s> Diane?
<s> I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
<s> All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
<s> I don't know who I am.
<s> Unh, unh.
<s> Mulholland Drive?
<s> Come on... let's find you something to wear.
<s> Not that I can see.
<s> "I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."
<s> Good luck!
<s> Okay.
<s> C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
<s> Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> Oh boy.
<s> Find out who they are?
<s> Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
<s> A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
<s> Where's the dock ?
<s> Great ! You couldn't be a fan of Dolphins or some other less threatening animal.
<s> Leave him, he's dead.
<s> I don't know.
<s> NO ! I wouldn't do that.
<s> You've been doing a bang up job so far. Right now Matt is probably dead and it's your fault.
<s> I'm listening.
<s> Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
<s> Know what ? That it was your fault ?
<s> Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
<s> The Brooklyn Bridge.
<s> I work here, remember ?
<s> I told him not to sit down in there.....
<s> Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
<s> Are you hunting wabbits ?
<s> What ? Are you my mother ?
<s> RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
<s> Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
<s> What do you mean sir ?
<s> Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
<s> I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
<s> We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
<s> What ?????
<s> I don't know.....
<s> I have a turn for the worse for the team !
<s> Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
<s> I can see that but where ?
<s> <<belch>>
<s> Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
<s> I think I'll see hat action.
<s> How can this happen ?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Thank you.
<s> "How's your foot" ? This guy tried to kill us and he put us in this place, and you want to know how his foot is ?
<s> Zach from work ?
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Come to the rescue again I see.
<s> Good morning.
<s> Don't mention it.
<s> Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch.
<s> Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
<s> Have fun.
<s> I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
<s> Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
<s> If I eat it I'll throw up.
<s> Oh.  Ohhh?
<s> Does she?
<s> 
<s> That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
<s> Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
<s> I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.
<s> oh.
<s> Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
<s> Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
<s> Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
<s> No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
<s> Then I have come to the right place.
<s> The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
<s> My mother.
<s> I never met my mother.
<s> Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
<s> Give it back Nicholas!
<s> Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
<s> This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
<s> He is one of the great poets.
<s> Don't force it, you'll break it.
<s> In the tar??
<s> I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
<s> 
<s> I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
<s> I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
<s> Rose this not the place to be having this...
<s> He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
<s> That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
<s> Committed.
<s> Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
<s> Sounds like you're very organized.
<s> Is that a yes?
<s> She'll be all right baby.
<s> Bye Niece, Vada.
<s> Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
<s> I'll be here.
<s> Oh, sure okay.
<s> I bet your mom sang to you.
<s> Is there milk in them already?
<s> Oh no.
<s> I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
<s> Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
<s> Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
<s> Vada!!
<s> I'm impressed.
<s> Yeah, all right...
<s> I think it's still available.
<s> Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
<s> Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
<s> I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
<s> Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
<s> Here?
<s> See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
<s> Want to what?
<s> Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
<s> Is it really your camper?
<s> I know that, but what do you want from me?
<s> What?
<s> Sorry.
<s> Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
<s> She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
<s> Are you sure about all this?
<s> Vada, this is an adult writing class.
<s> I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
<s> Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
<s> Well you don't know that. Ask him.
<s> Can we look around in your camper?
<s> Come here, sit down.
<s> Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
<s> I will I promise.
<s> I can't, I have to go home.
<s> Hey, we can become blood brothers.
<s> You could pick that scab on your arm.
<s> HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!
<s> Bye Mrs. Sennett.
<s> I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.
<s> My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
<s> It is not.
<s> Would you think of me?
<s> Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
<s> I honestly wish I could...
<s> Desperate.  To talk.
<s> No, he's ruining yours.
<s> Impressive.
<s> What do you suggest?
<s> And what will he do?
<s> Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...
<s> He said that, too.
<s> ... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
<s> I've missed a step.
<s> Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
<s> Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
<s> Hello.
<s> Exactly.
<s> He won't get mad, huh?
<s> We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.
<s> I love him.
<s> ... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
<s> I hope so.  This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.
<s> He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.
<s> ... Thomas, yeh.
<s> Mirrors.
<s> What's next?
<s> What, leaving school...
<s> I never eat when I'm serene.
<s> Have you.
<s> Me either.
<s> It means a lot.
<s> "Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
<s> No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
<s> And your point?
<s> Oh, yeah.
<s> Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
<s> This is the dumbest thing I will ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that I can't.  I don't think.
<s> Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
<s> What do you have to buy?
<s> You'll have to speak up.
<s> Oh, sure.
<s> Okay.
<s> President.
<s> Minimum.
<s> When is it?
<s> It's the den mother.
<s> National?
<s> Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.
<s> Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
<s> She's in Paris.
<s> Not yet.
<s> I'll just be in here.
<s> No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.
<s> Oh... a little of both. Just thought I'd look around at Nashville for a while.
<s> Maybe you can look after me a little.
<s> Well, he's really amazing.
<s> I don't really know what you're talking about.
<s> Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe you know where...
<s> Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.
<s> But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
<s> Yes, it is --
<s> No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
<s> Hi.
<s> End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
<s> I can't.
<s> Well...
<s> Fifteen minutes?
<s> Can you make a rehearsal in the morning...?  Courtland wants to...
<s> They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
<s> Why?
<s> Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
<s> You do?
<s> You bet.
<s> Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
<s> It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work.
<s> Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
<s> The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.
<s> Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
<s> You been followin' the news coverage?
<s> Susanville, Soledade.
<s> I see.
<s> How's it goin'?
<s> She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
<s> Not good.
<s> It's video.
<s> Whose ratings were higher?
<s> You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
<s> Yeah, we have a van.
<s> On average forty million.
<s> No. Not really.
<s> We are.  Your camera.
<s> No fuckin' way!
<s> And a snake-eye glare.
<s> Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
<s> They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
<s> Capt'n!
<s> It's hard to say Capt'n.
<s> I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
<s> What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
<s> Wayne---
<s> Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
<s> Wayne Gayle.
<s> They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
<s> Yeah, sure.
<s> Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
<s> They got a asshole over here.  A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.  A asshole perched up there.  Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this...  ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy.
<s> Wayne, if it was anybody else---
<s> See Duff. He's the money man.
<s> No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine.
<s> That'll be thirty-eight cents.
<s> You in a big hurry, boy?
<s> All right, you get out of here, man!
<s> Okay.
<s> I don't know what you're talkin' about.
<s> What d'you think?
<s> Okay.
<s> Where was your father born?
<s> That's right. How' you doin', Barney?
<s> Yeah, I been there.
<s> You work around town?
<s> No.
<s> Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
<s> Well, I don't get on so well most places.
<s> You got a problem all right.
<s> I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
<s> You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
<s> Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
<s> Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
<s> Four.
<s> I thought you wasn't comin'.
<s> Well, what d'you think?
<s> It'll be fine when we get done with it.
<s> Don't call them that.
<s> You still didn't answer my question.
<s> You will.
<s> Duff--
<s> You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
<s> Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
<s> What's on your mind?
<s> Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
<s> Plannin' on getting married?
<s> Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
<s> She'll do.
<s> Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
<s> Whenever he's got an edge on.
<s> Yeah, sure. Good luck.
<s> No thanks, Lee.
<s> No, they won't.
<s> How are you?
<s> Thank you.
<s> It's for your own good.
<s> I understand.
<s> Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
<s> Anything you say, baby.
<s> You hate Raoul?
<s> Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
<s> That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
<s> Since when?
<s> Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
<s> He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
<s> My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
<s> My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
<s> We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
<s> I've arranged for him to work with us.
<s> I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
<s> What's he doing to my gear?
<s> You'll be linked during the entire operation.
<s> The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
<s> Can you read my mind?
<s> Are you even really alive?
<s> Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
<s> As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
<s> What?
<s> I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
<s> That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
<s> So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
<s> We got problems topside.
<s> We run. You crack the pattern?
<s> What's that supposed to mean?
<s> What the fuck... are you serious?
<s> What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
<s> A regular Fagan.
<s> Too late?
<s> Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
<s> Something exotic I hope.
<s> No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
<s> What?
<s> Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
<s> Yeah. Let's do that.
<s> This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
<s> If you say so.
<s> OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
<s> I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
<s> Anita, remember espadrilles?
<s> At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
<s> That is lingerie.
<s> 
<s> Sometimes opposites attract.
<s> Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
<s> Transitioned?
<s> You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
<s> A flack jacket.
<s> You're a sick puppy, Geller.
<s> They hid my car--
<s> No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
<s> I'm Rob's prom date.
<s> No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
<s> Is that true?
<s> No. Josie, this is real.
<s> True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
<s> You remember that story?
<s> I don't have to say that.
<s> I know.
<s> That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
<s> That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
<s> Oh--yikes!
<s> I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
<s> You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
<s> Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
<s> Thank you.  I'm Rob.
<s> <i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
<s> No!
<s> I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
<s> Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
<s> <i>                      Now and forever...</i>
<s> <i>                      You're so stupid, think now -- If we blow him up to smithereens, We may lose some pieces and then Jack will beat us black and green.</i>
<s> Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
<s> Oh, come on Dad...
<s> And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
<s> I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
<s> Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.
<s> It was okay.
<s> Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
<s> Only the wet ones.
<s> Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
<s> Look at this car.  Are you kidding?
<s> Uh-uh.  Before my time.
<s> I'll get over it.
<s> Ghostbusters are fearless.
<s> Oh, Jesse...
<s> My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
<s> No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
<s> Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
<s> Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
<s> He's full of shit.
<s> Don't hold your breath.
<s> Wait and see.
<s> I gotta stay up, Max.
<s> Just tonight, please?  I can't handle the nightmare.  Not tonight.  Not after Phillip.
<s> Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
<s> But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
<s> He's real.
<s> He's heavy in the halls...
<s> So?
<s> Those are ancient history.
<s> Fuck off.
<s> A little basic, but nice.
<s> She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
<s> It'll be my last chance.  Pleese?
<s> So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
<s> Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
<s> I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
<s> That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
<s> I can do that.
<s> Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
<s> A sad choice.
<s> I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
<s> Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  It is an abomination to God and Man.
<s> Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
<s> Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
<s> Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
<s> Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
<s> In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.
<s> Me too.
<s> We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
<s> Here, let me help.
<s> Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
<s> Hello.
<s> No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
<s> No, you were brilliant
<s> Oh no no -- no.
<s> I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
<s> Well done you.
<s> It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
<s> Stay forever.
<s> You do?
<s> You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
<s> That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
<s> And what would you say...
<s> Is that right?
<s> Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
<s> Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
<s> It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
<s> No -- it's my 22nd.
<s> Working with Leonardo.
<s> Well, yes.  Groovy.
<s> How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
<s> What's your name?
<s> Ah... yes, enormously.
<s> Can I help you?
<s> No -- did you?
<s> Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
<s> No, don't think I do.
<s> So not over her, in fact.
<s> Hi...
<s> Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
<s> Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...
<s> What?
<s> And you get on very well.
<s> Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
<s> Three.
<s> So?
<s> Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
<s> I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
<s> I-I-I...
<s> Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
<s> Yes, ma'am...
<s> Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.
<s> What for?
<s> You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
<s> I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
<s> Thank you, ma'am.
<s> H-H-Hearts.
<s> What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore.
<s> 'K-k-kay, Mack!
<s> W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
<s> Go ahead! Go back!
<s> H-Hey, M-Mack.
<s> Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points...
<s> Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan...
<s> C-C-C-C-Candy!
<s> Yeah...
<s> Are they all crazies?
<s> That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
<s> Atta boy, Cheswick!
<s> Yeah, Mack, what is it?
<s> Hey, what's that?
<s> Huh?
<s> Through the ass.
<s> Your buddy is callin' ya.
<s> I'm seeing what a busy man does.
<s> She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.
<s> What for?
<s> Okay, Harding, you're on.
<s> I refuse!
<s> I don't trust you!
<s> No!
<s> McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
<s> Me. Hit me!
<s> Hold it a minute.
<s> No. Me! Me!
<s> Oh, what was that?
<s> Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report?
<s> I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
<s> Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
<s> You're on.  Let's go! An' keep it quiet.
<s> Shhh!  This way!
<s> Breakfast! Hell, I know just the place where we can chow down an' thaw out before we shoot back on home. 'Kay?
<s> He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
<s> Come an' see.
<s> Oh, yeah...
<s> He's in charge.
<s> P.A. What the hell is that?
<s> On what?
<s> Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!
<s> I don't have any.
<s> Take you han's offa me!
<s> No way...
<s> Evenin', ma'am.
<s> Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
<s> Shhh... let's move it away from the window...
<s> Oh, yeah...
<s> Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
<s> Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
<s> I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
<s> Ask her if she knows where he is?
<s> If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.  And stop talking.  You're gonna ruin the spell.
<s> Okaaaaayyyy.
<s> Non.  Please.
<s> I'm at the airport.  Why?
<s> NO.
<s> What?
<s> Because.  I know where he is.
<s> Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
<s> Hi.  Are you... busy?
<s> I can't believe you did that!
<s> Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
<s> Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
<s> Uh huh.
<s> Just since yesterday.
<s> Well, not exactly...
<s> Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
<s> Oh.
<s> Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
<s> Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 
<s> What?
<s> What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
<s> You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
<s> 'Course he does.
<s> Larry bought himself cologne?
<s> Sure you did.
<s> Hi.  Where've you been?
<s> What about Peter?...
<s> You sure you'll be okay?
<s> Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
<s> Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
<s> So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
<s> And Larry?...
<s> A pig!  A pig!  She's saying he's a pig.
<s> I'd love to.
<s> No.
<s> He missed me.
<s> Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
<s> She didn't give me a chance.
<s> She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
<s> Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
<s> Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
<s> In a minute.
<s> You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
<s> Yeah yeah I guess I do but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
<s> Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
<s> What do you weigh these days, slugger?
<s> Why Edie, I
<s> Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
<s> Tommy, what happened?
<s> Give it to me my Pop's job
<s> Do you like pigeons?
<s> I started them Golden Warriors. I was their first Supreme Commander.
<s> I don't know.
<s> How do you like it?
<s> Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!  You really believe that drool?
<s> Edie it's
<s> Are you sure they're your friends?
<s> Terry...?
<s> Let me by.
<s> How much is your soul worth if you don't?
<s> Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you   Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
<s> You go to
<s> Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
<s> I can? Okay.  Okay...
<s> Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
<s> I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
<s> Sure... .
<s> Be sure they got enough water.
<s> He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
<s> Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
<s> Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
<s> Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
<s> No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
<s> What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
<s> Be careful!
<s> I should hope not.  I hate you!
<s> At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
<s> Well then let us proceed.
<s> For what!?!
<s> Then why do you shake so?
<s> Aannnnaahhnn.
<s> He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.
<s> Oh.  Uh-huh.
<s> I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
<s> How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
<s> I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
<s> You're right.
<s> Shit.
<s> I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
<s> Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>.
<s> I saw Karen Sisco.
<s> Yes, she did.
<s> I don't ski.
<s> And then they'll kill 'em.
<s> All you gotta do is get in.
<s> I'll go with you.
<s> Daniel Burdon, FBI.
<s> That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
<s> You'll have to ask him.
<s> Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
<s> What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
<s> Wait.  You not Adele?
<s> You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
<s> Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
<s> Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
<s> Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
<s> Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted for it.  White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time.
<s> That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
<s> You're right.  So why take a chance--
<s> You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
<s> Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
<s> Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
<s> Sure.
<s> I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
<s> They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
<s> Shit...
<s> Really.  He has a cop's face.
<s> Because you're having too much fun.
<s> Those guys bother you?
<s> I don't have a problem with it.
<s> To warn her about Chino.
<s> I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
<s> Pretend I'm somebody else.
<s> Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
<s> I see better with them on.
<s> In the trunk?
<s> How many?
<s> You know who they are?
<s> Any time.
<s> Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
<s> Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
<s> The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
<s> What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
<s> I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
<s> Islamic.
<s> Meaning time came, I left.
<s> That time?
<s> Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
<s> We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
<s> He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
<s> Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?
<s> Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
<s> Thanks.
<s> You not with probation, one of those?
<s> We don't get to talk much any more.
<s> I'd like that.
<s> No?
<s> Hello?
<s> I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
<s> I didn't have time.
<s> I told you, he isn't here.
<s> Like a fag.
<s> Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
<s> Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
<s> Ten gees.
<s> That's your line for tonight, ya know.
<s> The one that slept in my mouth last night.
<s> Mai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya, about mai-tai's.
<s> They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...
<s> You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
<s> I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
<s> Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
<s> Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
<s> Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
<s> No.  You're trying to beat me.
<s> Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come.
<s> He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
<s> Well...sure.
<s> I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
<s> How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
<s> Thank you, Sir.
<s> Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
<s> You too, Lieutenant.
<s> Nice to meet you, Betty.
<s> You waited til tonight to tell me?
<s> Do one thing for me, before you go.
<s> Why were you sitting here, instead of...
<s> How did you?...
<s> And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
<s> God help them.
<s> And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
<s> The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
<s> Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
<s> Stag movies. Smokers.
<s> We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
<s> It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
<s> That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
<s> Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
<s> Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
<s> I'm not going.
<s> Pretty strange.
<s> Would you?
<s> And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
<s> That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
<s> Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
<s> How'd you know about that?
<s> You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
<s> Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
<s> Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
<s> How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
<s> What?
<s> I'm trying.
<s> Oh, God, Dion.
<s> I'll never give up.
<s> Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
<s> It must run in the family.
<s> She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
<s> He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
<s> What're you doing here anyway?
<s> For everyone.
<s> Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
<s> Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
<s> Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
<s> Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
<s> This is your great invention?  Would you wear those things?
<s> What about?
<s> I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
<s> I don't feel very festive.
<s> What does Charlie think about that?
<s> He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
<s> I'm just happy to see you.
<s> I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
<s> Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
<s> Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
<s> But accidents can happen.
<s> Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
<s> Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.
<s> Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
<s> How, did you know about my grandfather?
<s> That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
<s> What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
<s> How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
<s> Give me some credit, will you?
<s> Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
<s> Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
<s> We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
<s> I couldn't help it  I loved him.
<s> You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
<s> The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
<s> How'd you know that?
<s> Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
<s> I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...
<s> He pissed me off.
<s> You know everything, don't you?
<s> You'll have to get right on it, Andy, we're up against the statute of limitations.
<s> Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
<s> Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.
<s> He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
<s> I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
<s> I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
<s> No.
<s> More than your friend. Family.
<s> I have AIDS.
<s> Continue.
<s> Makeup.
<s> Fine.
<s> I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
<s> They didn't fire her?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Not bad.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
<s> There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
<s> You're ready, don't worry.
<s> I still am.
<s> You bet. We'll see you later.
<s> I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
<s> Hold on, Mom.  There's no way my client will go along with that.
<s> He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.
<s> Right.
<s> Uh.... No. Not really.
<s> That's correct.
<s> You're in trouble.
<s> Who?
<s> Duh...
<s> Very funny. I had a box of Pampers under my arm for Chrissake!
<s> Yeah... ?
<s> My lettuce is wilting.
<s> Night, honey.
<s> Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
<s> So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
<s> I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
<s> By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
<s> Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
<s> With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
<s> Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  It's an anti-trust action.
<s> Andy, you don't want this.
<s> You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?
<s> Charles...
<s> Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
<s> 'Mean the whispers?
<s> Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
<s> Riddick? How close?
<s> 200-year-old single-malt scotch is to "booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts."
<s> Like the light is scalding it.
<s> Possibly.
<s> Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
<s> Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
<s> Tell me it's not a mirage.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....
<s> I assume he licked it clean.
<s> Let's just be sure.
<s> Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
<s> And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
<s> 'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
<s> Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
<s> -- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
<s> And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>That's</u> how they train you! On a fucking simulator!
<s> You know who Muhammad was?
<s> Get the girl back under. Keep going.
<s> I'm born-again.
<s> Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
<s> Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
<s> Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
<s> Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...
<s> Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
<s> Right now, if you like.
<s> Good luck then.
<s> Remembers what?
<s> Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
<s> No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
<s> Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
<s> I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
<s> Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
<s> Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
<s> But I'm not prepared to die.
<s> What?
<s> Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
<s> I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
<s> Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
<s> Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
<s> He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
<s> Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
<s> Listen, listen -- I can speak --
<s> Why not?
<s> Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
<s> Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
<s> Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
<s> Says he can't walk.
<s> I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.
<s> Yeah, you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you, you'd probably kill it.
<s> Fuck this shit! I ain't dyin' in no white man's war! Ise didi-ing this motherfuckah!
<s> Then what do you suggest big shot?
<s> Out there man - behind the log.
<s> Yeah. How 'bout you?
<s> In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
<s> Go on, whatcha gotta lose, yo' here now...
<s> Fuck it, don't mean nothing, no such thing here as a coward, done your best man, next time y'do better.
<s> Who gives a shit!
<s> Found it. Growing in a garden.
<s> Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
<s> He dugged his own grave.
<s> I remember first time you came in here Taylor you telling me how much you admired that bastard.
<s> Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.
<s> How far does this train go?
<s> Well..
<s> Possibly, Miss.
<s> I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
<s> I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
<s> I don't.
<s> Is this the best you can do?
<s> They know you here--know your name.
<s> Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
<s> You don't know who he is?
<s> So have I.
<s> They'll look for you.
<s> Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
<s> Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
<s> There isn't anything you can do.
<s> There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious, take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters.
<s> Sometimes.
<s> I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
<s> All right. Get him.
<s> You asked for it.
<s> Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
<s> For five hundred, what do I get?
<s> Why not here?
<s> In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
<s> What's a buzzer?
<s> I've got good ears.
<s> The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.
<s> Yes, I've seen it before.
<s> Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
<s> If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
<s> Where would she go, anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.
<s> Did I do something wrong?
<s> You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
<s> Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
<s> Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
<s> Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
<s> And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
<s> That's not enough.
<s> Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.
<s> Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
<s> They tell me he'll be a great loss to the liquor trade. This Mayfield girl...
<s> He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
<s> Not quiet yet.
<s> That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
<s> I don't know, sir.
<s> We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
<s> I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
<s> What are my orders, sir?
<s> Nice.
<s> That's not very kind.
<s> You already have the checks, darling.
<s> Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
<s> It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
<s> If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost.  Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian.  In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Thank you.
<s> And to history.
<s> Thank you.  We met last week, at the Wajda film.  You won't remember. We didn't actually speak.
<s> Too bad.  What did your father do?
<s> I know.  I'm sorry.
<s> Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
<s> One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
<s> To the Fleet.
<s> Let me see.
<s> Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> Are you up to something?
<s> Why not sit down and wait?
<s> Darling Susan.
<s> Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
<s> 'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight.
<s> You do it... you first!
<s> You first!
<s> Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?
<s> I say when it's over!
<s> Zero distortion, sir.
<s> Not so far.
<s> That's the point, isn't it?
<s> Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
<s> Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
<s> Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
<s> Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
<s> Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.
<s> Angelo, we gotta talk.
<s> Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
<s> Nothing.
<s> I'm serious.
<s> Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
<s> Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover.
<s> What?
<s> Tyler, put the gun down.
<s> Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
<s> Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.
<s> What about the rest of Hopper's men?
<s> Like the old days, Dillon.
<s> Who's our back-up on this?
<s> This gets better by the minute.
<s> Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
<s> Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
<s> ... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
<s> The best friend I ever had.
<s> I think it's Hawkins.
<s> Twenty-five percent.
<s> I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
<s> No.
<s> What?
<s> You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
<s> What's that?
<s> Sure.  For five bucks.
<s> No.
<s> Not exactly.
<s> Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
<s> Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.
<s> I've known a lot of everybody.
<s> Why?
<s> I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
<s> I sell them.
<s> C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
<s> No.
<s> Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
<s> He died a long time ago.
<s> I think it's exciting.
<s> I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.
<s> Shush.  Of course you can.
<s> I more than liked it.
<s> It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
<s> Afternoon.
<s> Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
<s> No.
<s> I'm here.
<s> Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
<s> He's not gonna want us.
<s> I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
<s> I like steak.
<s> I don't think it would fit you.
<s> It's very expensive.
<s> Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?
<s> Of course.
<s> Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
<s> They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
<s> If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
<s> And what am I?
<s> Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
<s> I will never doubt again.
<s> Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
<s> You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
<s> But you don't know where he is.
<s> Over the Albino, I think.
<s> What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
<s> I don't understand.
<s> The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
<s> Shall we track them both?
<s> That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
<s> In that case --
<s> -- power too -- promise me that --
<s> Are you a rotten liar.
<s> Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated
<s> Thank you.
<s> That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
<s> You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
<s> Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
<s> I ought to be after twenty years.
<s> Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
<s> You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
<s> Oh, have it your way.
<s> For the Princess?
<s> An hour.
<s> "Of the silvery moon,
<s> How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
<s> In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
<s> Where?  What?
<s> Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
<s> Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
<s> Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
<s> I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
<s> You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
<s> You found a flop!
<s> Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
<s> Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
<s> No way out.  No way out.
<s> Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
<s> Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.
<s> Yes.
<s> No kidding?
<s> Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
<s> Come on.  Let's get going.
<s> You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
<s> No.  We go. 
<s> No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work.
<s> You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.
<s> Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
<s> And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.
<s> OH.  "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is not place to talk.  Come! 
<s> Where are you going vit the light?
<s> Sing a song!  Just sing a song!
<s> She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
<s> Tell me all about her.
<s> How early?
<s> Of which morning?
<s> No one met her?
<s> You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
<s> Anyone at home?
<s> Who are you, friend?
<s> Money.
<s> Must've needed it.
<s> Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
<s> But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
<s> He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
<s> I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
<s> Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
<s> Just what he told your detective.
<s> I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
<s> Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
<s> Yes.
<s> I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
<s> Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
<s> Are we just going to go on sitting here?
<s> Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
<s> I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
<s> This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary...
<s> Neither will I.
<s> I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
<s> She always tries to be proper.
<s> Why not?
<s> Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
<s> Can you?
<s> I thought I'd gotten off the main...
<s> The bathroom.
<s> I have?
<s> I'd like to.
<s> Don't worry about it.  But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
<s> It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
<s> Norman.
<s> Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
<s> Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
<s> Do what?
<s> What--special autopsy?
<s> [Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
<s> No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
<s> You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
<s> [Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
<s> Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
<s> No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
<s> Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
<s> That sounds to me very remarkable.
<s> Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
<s> By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
<s> Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
<s> Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
<s> Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something.  Those women have--the gleam--
<s> It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
<s> I'm losing my blood!
<s> No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
<s> What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
<s> At any time. You will always be welcome.
<s> And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
<s> It happens that I'm the law.
<s> No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
<s> Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
<s> Nope, I'm through!
<s> About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
<s> Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
<s> I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
<s> Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
<s> What does that prove?
<s> Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.
<s> They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
<s> No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. 
<s> You go in for dangerous things.
<s> You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
<s> No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
<s> And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
<s> But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
<s> Yes.
<s> You have done well, and now I, too, have something for you. Come.
<s> I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
<s> Thanks.
<s> You did.
<s> Excuse me???
<s> That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
<s> Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
<s> Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you.  Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?
<s> Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
<s> You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
<s> That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
<s> Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
<s> Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?
<s> Am I hurting you?
<s> You won't die, Rose.
<s> Okay.
<s> They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
<s> Five hundred rabbits?
<s> Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
<s> Well, yeah.
<s> Yeah, he's still up there.
<s> Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.
<s> Let me see!
<s> What are they doing, Doll?
<s> Is that all?
<s> Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts
<s> Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
<s> Then why does she act so dumb?
<s> Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
<s> A wonderful woman, boy.
<s> I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
<s> No, son, she is dead.
<s> Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
<s> Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
<s> Oh. Did you say something?
<s> Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
<s> And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
<s> Why, they won't either. She looks pretty. And I wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. Don't listen to him, Rose, you look pretty, even beautiful.
<s> The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.
<s> What time is it?
<s> Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
<s> But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
<s> Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
<s> Fine.
<s> Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
<s> All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
<s> Well, it has buttons.
<s> Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
<s> Mine.
<s> I don't believe it.
<s> Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
<s> It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
<s> Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
<s> Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
<s> Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
<s> She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
<s> No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.
<s> I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
<s> I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
<s> I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
<s> Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.
<s> Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
<s> I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
<s> Alright!  Alright... put me down...
<s> I need the "when" and the "where."
<s> It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.
<s> Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
<s> Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool. They'll be collector's items.
<s> That wasn't my fault.
<s> I'm just saying...
<s> I got him.
<s> Could be worse.  I don't know how, but I'm sure it could.
<s> Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.
<s> Welcome to Beverly Hills. Wife-swapping Capital of the World.
<s> Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
<s> It's not gonna happen.
<s> It's go time, Billy-B.
<s> What was I supposed to do?
<s> Follow me.
<s> Hey... HEY!    Cool down, Jumbo!
<s> Go wherever you want.  Live how you want.
<s> We've got the tape to prove it.
<s> There was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
<s> We've been chasing this deal six months, and now you're gonna chuck it out the window?
<s> Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
<s> What?
<s> You're about an inch away from insubordination!
<s> Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.
<s> Murderer?  Really?
<s> All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> I know it is, even if you don't.
<s> Gimmie a minute.
<s> Sounds good.
<s> Seatbelts fastened, please.
<s> There's not even enough places to stash it in a car.
<s> Beholden to none.
<s> They're... around.
<s> All right. Stand by.
<s> Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
<s> I can't kill my own father.
<s> But I have no sister.
<s> I can't see.
<s> Who are you?
<s> Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
<s> Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
<s> Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
<s> Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
<s> Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
<s> It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
<s> Here's the terminal.
<s> Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
<s> All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
<s> I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
<s> Come on! Come on!
<s> You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
<s> The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
<s> Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
<s> Quiet.
<s> Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
<s> I will not fight you, father.
<s> You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
<s> Never-r-r!
<s> Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
<s> I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
<s> Oh. Well, yes.
<s> I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
<s> I told you, my car broke down.
<s> Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
<s> Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
<s> And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
<s> A decision had to be made.
<s> I didn't make him for you
<s> Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
<s> Makes you cry
<s> Like I'm outside in the rain
<s> Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain.
<s> Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
<s> No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
<s> ...Fine.
<s> I think it's closed.
<s> ...I suppose.
<s> I wanna let my brother know where I am.
<s> I don't think I belong here.
<s> ...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
<s> I'll be waiting.
<s> ...What?
<s> What're we going to do?
<s> Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
<s> Christ.
<s> Paulie!
<s> ...Still don't feel no heat.
<s> Very high an' very fast.
<s> Does that bum have to say that?
<s> Don't like yours neither.
<s> ...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
<s> Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.
<s> The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
<s> What's happenin' here?
<s> Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
<s> I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
<s> Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.
<s> Do I have to pay juice?
<s> I'm gonna do somethin with it.
<s> Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
<s> What?
<s> I won't.
<s> Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
<s> ...No.
<s> Message -- What message?
<s> Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
<s> Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
<s> It ain't your locker no more.
<s> He ain't losin' nothin'.
<s> Yeah, sure -- She's very excited.
<s> Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
<s> Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
<s> What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
<s> Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
<s> If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
<s> Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
<s> Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
<s> That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
<s> No...
<s> That's because I don't have a doorbell.
<s> Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
<s> You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
<s> He's right here in the...
<s> Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
<s> That was the idea.
<s> Take it easy.
<s> Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
<s> An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
<s> Me.
<s> Safe?
<s> Forget it.
<s> I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
<s> I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
<s> If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you.
<s> By my head here come the Capulets.
<s> Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
<s> The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
<s> Be not so long to speak I long to die.
<s> Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
<s> O, mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities: for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give, nor aught so good, but strain'd from that fair use revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: virtue itself turns vice, being misaplied; and vice sometimes by action dignified. Within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power: for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. Two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; and where the worser is predominant, full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
<s> Welcome.
<s> Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
<s> By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.
<s> Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
<s> Ahhh!
<s> A thousand times good night! Exit, above
<s> Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
<s> Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
<s> I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
<s> I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
<s> Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
<s> Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
<s> Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
<s> The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
<s> I thought all for the best.
<s> OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
<s> Is she a Capulet?
<s> As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
<s> Leaving...
<s> They're good!
<s> Nobody's saying they don't.
<s> I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
<s> Duty calls?
<s> I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.
<s> Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
<s> There's a problem...
<s> He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker.
<s> I think not.  After you...
<s> I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...
<s> Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
<s> How did you know?
<s> I didn't expect that he would.
<s> Gets the job done.
<s> Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  I don't mean that in, like, a literal way...
<s> Eat shit and die slowly...
<s> It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
<s> Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
<s> I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
<s> I do.
<s> Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
<s> That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
<s> Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
<s> I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
<s> No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
<s> I know of him.
<s> The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
<s> I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
<s> I don't know...
<s> Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
<s> Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
<s> Closest and oldest.
<s> Do you have a good answer?
<s> What?
<s> I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
<s> You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
<s> I want to get some hounds down here.
<s> I hear you.
<s> Seven thousand...
<s> Why?  Are you kidding me?
<s> We'll figure something out.
<s> Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
<s> I don't know...
<s> It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
<s> Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
<s> Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
<s> He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
<s> No.
<s> You killed him...
<s> Then we're screwed.
<s> He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
<s> Rock solid.
<s> Why don't you get to the point.
<s> All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
<s> Hello.
<s> You mean that guy was an agent?
<s> What's that?
<s> What for?
<s> He's irresponsible.
<s> It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
<s> Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.
<s> Did you say After Midnight?
<s> Hi.
<s> No, I can't say that I have.
<s> Yeah I'd say C...C.
<s> No I don't.  You sure you havent seen her?
<s> I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
<s> Yeah let's hear about your day.
<s> Dwayne put the gun down --
<s> Dwayne -
<s> Then what the hell are you all about?
<s> I was on a roll!  Im a little overextended now.
<s> You're never getting that much.
<s> Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
<s> Yeah.
<s> That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
<s> So...what's the good news?
<s> So someone did get away.
<s> Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
<s> No, sir.
<s> How much is that?
<s> I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!
<s> I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
<s> Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
<s> Those girls drove off because of you.
<s> Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
<s> Try to land on your feet.
<s> Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
<s> Who died?
<s> Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
<s> Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
<s> I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
<s> Good at what?
<s> How the hell did Tan get away with it?
<s> You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
<s> IT IS CRAZY!
<s> What?
<s> Why LA?
<s> Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
<s> Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
<s> The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.
<s> There's people up here!
<s> We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
<s> Why did you help me?
<s> No mu-shu.
<s> It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
<s> What?!?!
<s> Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
<s> Fine with me.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> I need your help.
<s> Just trying to make it look real.
<s> Baby Duck?
<s> That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
<s> Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
<s> Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
<s> Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.
<s> A little.
<s> I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
<s> We are both full of shit.
<s> Yeah, it's good.
<s> This concrete?  This is still America.
<s> Oh yes.
<s> You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
<s> Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
<s> Where'd you get it?
<s> Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
<s> Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.
<s> It's called a dress.
<s> Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
<s> You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
<s> Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
<s> I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.
<s> You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
<s> You have what I asked for?
<s> As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
<s> Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got em.
<s> I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy.
<s> I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
<s> Maintain eye contact.
<s> I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
<s> Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
<s> Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
<s> Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
<s> Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
<s> It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
<s> Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Ah, beautiful.  I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
<s> Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
<s> Without oxygen...
<s> A pre-wedding luau?
<s> You can turn that finger around.
<s> I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
<s> Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
<s> Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
<s> A little longer for me.
<s> I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
<s> They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
<s> She's the boss.
<s> Lighten up, what?
<s> Not eight...
<s> No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
<s> Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
<s> Houseboats don't go anywhere.
<s> -- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
<s> At the top of the Empire State Building --
<s> That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
<s> "I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
<s> Listen to this, I love this part --
<s> You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
<s> So I mailed your letter.
<s> So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
<s> Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
<s> I know. 
<s> Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
<s> What?
<s> We'll move them --
<s> How amazing.
<s> What?
<s> Mom, we already...
<s> It's me?
<s> Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
<s> What's she talking about?
<s> It's not that late in Seattle.
<s> Why not?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't think I have to now.
<s> Nobody else is going to know it was us.
<s> I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
<s> They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
<s> Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
<s> Good.
<s> The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
<s> Not now, Jonah --
<s> She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
<s> Okay.
<s> Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
<s> It's a short word.
<s> This is the one I like.
<s> Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
<s> What about it?
<s> Thanks, but... we've got plans.
<s> It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
<s> So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
<s> Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
<s> I don't make policy.
<s> You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
<s> An American.
<s> Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
<s> I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
<s> I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
<s> All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
<s> He'll have it good. Some day.
<s> We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
<s> You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
<s> You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
<s> No.
<s> I was talking to my wife.
<s> How about in the house?
<s> First rate, ain't it?
<s> Leave me out of this.
<s> Ouch.
<s> This man sounds like a real catch.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
<s> Then leave.
<s> You get off on abuse or something?
<s> Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
<s> What happened to your eye?
<s> Don't worry. He's out of town.
<s> This has nothing to do with him.
<s> Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
<s> You always been this stubborn?
<s> I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
<s> I don't want to leave you.
<s> I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
<s> I know a guy.
<s> Why's that?
<s> You don't say.
<s> You on a roll?
<s> I find myself in dire need of some cash.
<s> You mean, like to throw 'em off?
<s> Wait till I tell you what it is.
<s> I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
<s> But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already.
<s> Okay! Okay!
<s> I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
<s> Yeah, dickhead.
<s> Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
<s> Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.
<s> News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
<s> Jesus.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Answer the fucking question!
<s> It speaks!
<s> And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
<s> What if he caps me before you can make a move?
<s> Worse. Much worse.  A teacher.
<s> I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
<s> Again, I thank you.
<s> Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
<s> That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
<s> Don't worry about it.
<s> It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
<s> Where are your men now?
<s> He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
<s> What about the Captain?  Where's he from?
<s> Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
<s> Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
<s> I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
<s> Nope, he ain't Wade.
<s> Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
<s> White-walls?
<s> Senator's son?
<s> You know classical music?
<s> Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
<s> I've got a line on one.
<s> Since when have things been normal?
<s> Nope.
<s> Three for three.
<s> It doesn't take this.
<s> Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.
<s> And what about your own hand?
<s> Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
<s> Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
<s> Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
<s> Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
<s> Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices.
<s> I don't like that one.
<s> Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
<s> More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
<s> I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.
<s> Alright, come with me.
<s> Struggling with a pair of Germans.
<s> As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
<s> Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.
<s> Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
<s> What are we likely to run into?
<s> Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
<s> Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
<s> See you tomorrow.
<s> Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
<s> And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
<s> I just saw Joe.  He's here.
<s> I can accept that.
<s> Alright.
<s> Look, why don't you just call Diane again?
<s> I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
<s> Oh yeah!
<s> Okay.
<s> Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
<s> I just had a phone call.
<s> No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
<s> Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
<s> And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
<s> Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream.
<s> Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.
<s> Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present, here, let him know you still care.  Give him this pen.
<s> I'm so ashamed dad.
<s> Alright.
<s> Hi.  You called me?
<s> Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
<s> Pardon me?
<s> It's the worst job since keymaster.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah, I've had it forever.  I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.
<s> You think so?
<s> Okay, bye, I will.
<s> Wait, wait.  You told her about me?
<s> Be friends?
<s> Yeah.
<s> No, I don't, I don't.
<s> My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
<s> I love you.
<s> Man, you're bringing me down!
<s> Uh... okay... um...
<s> Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
<s> Yeah.  Honey?
<s> I'm totally and completely serious.
<s> Very talented.
<s> I'm incarcerated, Lloyd!  I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this.  I don't deserve to have you as my go-between.  And I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you.
<s> I know this part, keep reading.
<s> It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
<s> How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
<s> Hey.
<s> You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
<s> Yeah, alright.
<s> I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.
<s> I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
<s> I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
<s> I'd say I'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, I don't know.
<s> We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
<s> I pay you too much.
<s> He's important to my business.
<s> Look -
<s> I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
<s> That's great, thanks.
<s> There's nothing in the stores.
<s> Nice things cost money.
<s> How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
<s> I need a drink.
<s> So I'll talk to him about it.
<s> Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.
<s> I think most people right now have other priorities.
<s> The contracts?  That's the easy part. Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.
<s> Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
<s> Yes.
<s> They arrived, can you believe it?
<s> On national television.
<s> thought he was doing AA.
<s> I won't.
<s> Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
<s> Why aren't you there?
<s> That's too bad.
<s> I'm inquisitive.
<s> I'll go. I don't mind. Really.
<s> Can we talk?
<s> Did it?
<s> What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
<s> Home--where he lives.
<s> Enter Cotton Weary.
<s> Not one bit.
<s> I think it's out of your control.
<s> Let us decide that.
<s> No. This is a set up.
<s> What guy?
<s> Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
<s> Youd me amazed at how many of us there are out there. Its a whole world, Sid. Youre really popular amongst the demented.
<s> Hope youre ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
<s> I see you read the book.
<s> And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
<s> Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
<s> What are we looking for?
<s> Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
<s> I'll give you one guess.
<s> I'm everywhere.
<s> No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
<s> Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
<s> No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
<s> No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
<s> You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
<s> ..harmonica style is okay.
<s> Gale?
<s> Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
<s> Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
<s> I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
<s> Don't panic.
<s> I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
<s> Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
<s> I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
<s> But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
<s> Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
<s> Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
<s> All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
<s> Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
<s> It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
<s> Always.
<s> Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
<s> Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
<s> Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
<s> Gale Weathers would find a way. 
<s> Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
<s> Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
<s> They're the ones who approved it.
<s> Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
<s> Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?"
<s> Who's this.
<s> Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
<s> SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
<s> I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
<s> It's called tact, you fuckrag.
<s> You know it.
<s> Yeah...
<s> Where the fuck did she go?
<s> Now that it's out of your system.
<s> Oh it did?
<s> So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
<s> It's been a year since she died.
<s> It's okay. We need to talk.
<s> So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
<s> You lost your mom...
<s> You don't still think it was me?
<s> Stop it!
<s> You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
<s> I only eat popcorn at the movies.
<s> Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
<s> Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
<s> I want to now who I'm talking to.
<s> I told you not to hang up on me.
<s> More of a game, really.
<s> I'm getting scared.
<s> His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
<s> Come on. It'll be fun.
<s> Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
<s> We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
<s> Then what are you doing here?
<s> Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
<s> Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Afraid not.
<s> How is she?
<s> Not my daughter... not my...
<s> But it's so much easier when we make it up.
<s> Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
<s> Has his story changed?
<s> He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
<s> So where are you?
<s> Got it.
<s> Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
<s> Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
<s> I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
<s> He came to make up.
<s> Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
<s> Wanna another beer?
<s> No, Sid.
<s> Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
<s> No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
<s> I'll be there by seven. I promise
<s> Whatever. Just hurry.
<s> It was him, Tatum. I know it.
<s> Oh, god...
<s> Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
<s> He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
<s> Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible.  Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment.
<s> Greed.  It was written in blood.
<s> Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?
<s> David... please...
<s> NO!
<s> Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
<s> Spit it out.
<s> And, why is that?
<s> Please be quiet for a while, would you?
<s> What?
<s> I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
<s> Whoa, whoa... what?!
<s> All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
<s> Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
<s> A switchblade.
<s> Bullshit.
<s> Satisfy our curiosity?
<s> Call an ambulance.
<s> I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
<s> If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
<s> I don't.  Neither do you.
<s> That is.
<s> It was him.
<s> These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.
<s> You do your job...
<s> It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
<s> Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
<s> No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
<s> Call for help, and you'll live.  But, you'll be disfigured.  Or, put yourself out of your misery.
<s> Kiss me on the lips.
<s> I don't see anything.
<s> I want to have children.  It's just...
<s> This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
<s> What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
<s> ...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
<s> Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
<s> God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
<s> I'm Clayton.
<s> Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
<s> JOINT action?
<s> Grab hold!...
<s> You lie! All white men lie...and kill...
<s> These are my people...  Unnt-meah! Go! Go! <U>Please</U>!
<s> SURE!...They <U>WERE</U> here...Now they're out there...an' waitin' to jump us!...
<s> Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
<s> Ethan...I found a man's seen her... knows where little Debbie is!
<s> Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
<s> Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven...
<s> No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
<s> I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
<s> She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
<s> Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
<s> Over there!
<s> Not far from it...
<s> They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
<s> There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
<s> That's the breed...Course it might take time.
<s> I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
<s> You've seen her!...She's alive?
<s> A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
<s> Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
<s> Ain't worth the mendin'...
<s> Finish your breakfast...
<s> One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
<s> No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
<s> You?
<s> My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
<s> Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
<s> What?
<s> Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
<s> And two months later, we got married.  And all because of one sentence:  "With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
<s> So do I, believe me.
<s> Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
<s> In the village.  Look what I found.
<s> Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
<s> What are you talking about-
<s> Thank you.
<s> I think I've killed him.  Martin, my husband, I've killed him!  That is, I'm not sure, but...
<s> Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
<s> Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
<s> How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...
<s> Yes.
<s> Twenty pounds on delivery
<s> You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
<s> Ask him.
<s> When I have fifty pounds.
<s> It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
<s> Who is that?
<s> Put his feet in.
<s> I don't know. It's a mystery.
<s> Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
<s> Nobody knew!
<s> We are about to embark on a great voyage.
<s> "Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
<s> Oh, but they can!
<s> Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
<s> I would have made you immortal.  Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
<s> My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
<s> I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
<s> No, the morning rooster woke me.
<s> I must. I must
<s> You never spoke so well of him.
<s> You lie.
<s> Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
<s> I  Her letter came to me by the nurse.
<s> Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
<s> Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
<s> Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
<s> It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.
<s> By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
<s> Are you bringing your laundry woman?
<s> On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
<s> Will you shut up and play.
<s> About what?
<s> Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
<s> A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
<s> I don't hear this.
<s> Your friends.
<s> It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
<s> They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
<s> Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
<s> Cover it?
<s> But there's no --
<s> Take another look at these two.
<s> That's all?
<s> Cameron?
<s> Really?
<s> Just serve.
<s> Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
<s> Not usually this drunk.
<s> It was you, Juliet, it was you --
<s> Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
<s> Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
<s> Yes.
<s> What? What's wrong?
<s> Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
<s> Then let's spend some money.
<s> Oh, good.
<s> And the money?
<s> I'll wait there.
<s> The perfect couple, I should say.
<s> No.
<s> Let him go. Let him take it all.
<s> What about?
<s> Of course.
<s> That was stressful. I found that stressful.
<s> No.
<s> I should hope so.
<s> It wasn't like that.
<s> Exactly what I was --
<s> I'm boring?
<s> Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
<s> Did he sound upset?
<s> No. But he needs treatment.
<s> A certain weakness.
<s> And that's not the same thing?
<s> But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
<s> Yeah, baby, how's it going?
<s> Look, would you argue with your doctor?
<s> She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
<s> Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
<s> That's okay too.
<s> Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
<s> I'm coming, baby --  How's Otis doing, anyway?
<s> Why don't you see Lester?
<s> I don't know. Just a minute...
<s> Her?
<s> Hello.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Hungry?
<s> Have you ever made it with a girl?
<s> You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
<s> Then what do you think?
<s> I am not like my mother!
<s> Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?
<s> You going to tell him?
<s> Probably the bathroom.
<s> Did Lester know about him?
<s> I won't screw you up.
<s> What?
<s> I don't want to... I swear...
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> -- we can't now.
<s> Mmmm --
<s> Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
<s> It's too late...
<s> You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
<s> -- oh -- sweetheart...
<s> Okay... thanks...
<s> I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
<s> Great.
<s> Okay.
<s> Honey, have they offered you the job?
<s> Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.
<s> Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
<s> I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
<s> I do, Jill.
<s> Where did this come from?
<s> Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
<s> Yeah, I know. Did you?
<s> Did you?
<s> But Mr. Norman said --
<s> I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
<s> When?
<s> Oh, hey...
<s> I don't know what to...
<s> Yeah.  How long have you been here?
<s> Well... who are those guys?
<s> Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
<s> Okay, thanks.
<s> What about her?
<s> Yes I do.
<s> No.
<s> I'll call you back.
<s> You do?
<s> I am?
<s> Who do you think I was talking to?
<s> Fine.
<s> Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
<s> Aren't you going to have one?
<s> Jackie, what're you doing?
<s> I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> I'll call you.
<s> Who is that?
<s> I guess not.
<s> Don't be silly.
<s> No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
<s> All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
<s> -- sort of a boyfriend?
<s> Two weeks from tomorrow.
<s> No... how long did you say?
<s> No, it's not that...
<s> Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
<s> What was the Donner party?
<s> You mean they ate each other up?
<s> How does he tell you things?
<s> What about Tony?  He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
<s> All right.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Red Rum.  Red Rum.
<s> Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
<s> Danny!
<s> Oh!
<s> No.  It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.
<s> Do I have to?
<s> Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
<s> And, er... where are they now?
<s> Grady... oh.
<s> Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
<s> Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet.  I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.  So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice.  You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?  You're not to busy, are you?
<s> It's good to be back, Lloyd.
<s> Uh...huh.
<s> Lots of ideas.  No good ones.
<s> I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
<s> No, nothing at all.
<s> Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
<s> Good.
<s> I think he did it to himself.
<s> I don't think that's true.  I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are.
<s> You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
<s> When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
<s> I'm not going to hurt you.
<s> Wendy!
<s> Give me the bat.
<s> Go away.
<s> Wendy...
<s> Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
<s> Well, it's very... homely.
<s> Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
<s> Thank you, Susie.
<s> Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
<s> What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
<s> Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
<s> Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah! What is it?
<s> A tracer. You'll like it.
<s> What the hell does that matter?
<s> You want to know what I think?
<s> Marty, do you see your suspect?
<s> There! You see!
<s> See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
<s> We won't!
<s> If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
<s> Oh?
<s> What you say?
<s> You know what we're saying!
<s> We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.
<s> Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun.
<s> Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
<s> What did who say?
<s> You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
<s> And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.
<s> Right.
<s> No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
<s> Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but...  Could you help us?
<s> No way.  We're a choir, right? Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a week won't cut it.  Every day.
<s> That man -- who is he?
<s> Pay attention...
<s> Um, I don't really know this one...
<s> Wet behind the ears.
<s> You re okay -- for a civilian.
<s> I... I...
<s> It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
<s> Oh no.  We'll always be together.
<s> It's true!
<s> Don't you know it!
<s> What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
<s> Enough joking.
<s> Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
<s> What?
<s> What's a concubine?
<s> Of course.  But it's almost lunch.
<s> Can do.
<s> I'm outta here.
<s> Useless distractions.
<s> Your cell is more than adequate.
<s> I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
<s> Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
<s> Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
<s> I am?
<s> And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
<s> I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
<s> The majority has spoken.
<s> A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
<s> Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
<s> Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
<s> Even nuns have to pee.
<s> You found him -- but we're not open yet.
<s> Willy -- hit the lights.
<s> Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
<s> Which convent was that, Sister?
<s> Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a choirmistress?
<s> It's no use.  She just isn't here.
<s> And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
<s> It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
<s> Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
<s> Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
<s> Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
<s> All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
<s> Protest to my superiors if you like.
<s> Is that all you say?  Look at her.
<s> I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
<s> The Western Woods.
<s> Listen.
<s> No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
<s> What happened?
<s> You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
<s> But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
<s> I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
<s> I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
<s> If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
<s> No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
<s> The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
<s> The skull is gone.
<s> And, what did he say?
<s> What did he say, Katrina?
<s> The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
<s> Yes, actually.
<s> To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
<s> Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
<s> I can't remember.
<s> You got any money?
<s> I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
<s> I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.
<s> See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
<s> He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
<s> Good to know you, Karl.
<s> French-fried potaters.
<s> What you got in there, warshing?
<s> Karl's my name.
<s> Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
<s> It went real good.
<s> Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
<s> Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
<s> If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go out of my mind. And plus you're liable to bust a spring in Karl's head. He's already off balance.
<s> That's funny.  You go to bed and take snot nose with you.
<s> You're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then.  It wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause I ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm afraid for you to stay here. You're just a humped over retard it looks like to me. Not really, I'm just jokin' with you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. Frank needs all the friends he can get. Frank's a real weak little kid. His daddy taught him how to be a pussy.
<s> I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
<s> Why? Hi, Karl.
<s> I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
<s> Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
<s> He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
<s> How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
<s> I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
<s> All right then.
<s> All right then.
<s> They ort to. You're a good boy.
<s> I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
<s> I heared it cryin' a little through that box.
<s> Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
<s> Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
<s> You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
<s> I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
<s> Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
<s> Okay.
<s> Nice to meet you, Karl.
<s> I'm glad of it, honey.
<s> They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.
<s> No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
<s> Did Vaughan go home?
<s> Mama?
<s> I reckon.
<s> I ain't got no boy.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> I didn't aim to.
<s> Okay.
<s> Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
<s> So, you're really going to stay here?
<s> Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
<s> Can I help you, sir?
<s> Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
<s> How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
<s> Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
<s> As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.
<s> Why?
<s> You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
<s> Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
<s> I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.
<s> Better make it charge. 
<s> It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
<s> Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
<s> Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
<s> Uh...  My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.
<s> For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
<s> Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
<s> This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.
<s> If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?
<s> Fuck you, kid.
<s> That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
<s> Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.  Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.
<s> Uh, better make it one.
<s> Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
<s> You got it.
<s> Ready. Any time you are.
<s> I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
<s> You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
<s> I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
<s> It means "happiness."
<s> I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
<s> Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
<s> Where to?
<s> You what?
<s> Yeah, like what?
<s> Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
<s> Bully for you.
<s> It's all yours, baby.
<s> For keeps.
<s> They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
<s> Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
<s> You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?
<s> Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
<s> And these?
<s> And these?
<s> And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
<s> I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
<s> Paul. Paul Benjamin.
<s> That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
<s> And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
<s> That's how we met. We're members of the International Same Name Club. Believe it or not, there are 846 Paul Benjamins in America. But only two in the New York metropolitan area. That's how Paul and I got to be such good friends. We're the only ones who show up at the meetings.
<s> Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
<s> Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.
<s> An abortion, stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye, baby!
<s> I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
<s> Huh?
<s> Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
<s> That's okay. I've already had lunch.
<s> I mean breakfast.
<s> And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
<s> This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
<s> Is your father an artist?
<s> What time is it?
<s> I don't have much time. 
<s> Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
<s> The inspiration.
<s> Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
<s> Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
<s> That's it. In a nutshell.
<s> It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
<s> I'm not going to do it.
<s> What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
<s> Oh, yeh?
<s> No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
<s> Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...
<s> All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
<s> Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
<s> So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
<s> But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
<s> At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
<s> Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
<s> Look at my face.  It's the face of the people who did that.  My father hardly speaks English.  We're in bad trouble, you have to see that.
<s> Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
<s> Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.
<s> Pretty darn clear.
<s> Objection!  Speculation.
<s> That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
<s> Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
<s> Three kids.  What's she going to do?
<s> Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
<s> No, you don't.
<s> Fell.
<s> Still lashed to the mast.
<s> Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
<s> I'll take two.  One for later.
<s> It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
<s> A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
<s> Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
<s> He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
<s> As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that.
<s> If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
<s> I already said that, b...
<s> Not in those words.
<s> Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.
<s> I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
<s> Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
<s> Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
<s> I'll say.
<s> Of course I am.
<s> No we're not.
<s> He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
<s> I told you - it's a sure thing.
<s> So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion...  Right?
<s> No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
<s> Not yet.  But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over.  Type O.
<s> The police?  We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.  Wabash 1098.
<s> Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
<s> Now you tore the other one.
<s> Polish?
<s> Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
<s> Then pull the emergency brake!
<s> All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
<s> Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
<s> No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
<s> Oh, no.  I'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.
<s> Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
<s> What?
<s> That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
<s> What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
<s> We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
<s> Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.
<s> Tell him you're going to elope with him.
<s> That's ridiculous.
<s> What's the surprise?
<s> That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
<s> It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
<s> Or was it Bryn Mawr?
<s> If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
<s> Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
<s> Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
<s> I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
<s> You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
<s> Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
<s> Bull fiddle.
<s> Wanna bet?
<s> Oh, you don't get off that easy.
<s> Sorry.
<s> Flower girl.
<s> Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
<s> Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
<s> And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
<s> Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
<s> To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
<s> Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
<s> Yes, Joe.
<s> You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
<s> You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
<s> If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band.  You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
<s> That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
<s> You're entitled.
<s> So do I.  But don't worry - we'll be seeing a lot of each other.
<s> Saxophone player?
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
<s> No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -
<s> Well, I'm not.
<s> I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
<s> What?
<s> I am?
<s> Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
<s> Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
<s> Oh - a member of the herring family.
<s> Bon voyage.
<s> Completely.
<s> All right - if you insist.
<s> Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
<s> Good morning.
<s> Did you have a nice time?
<s> I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.
<s> From a rich millionaire.
<s> I'm afraid not.  I can't make it tonight.
<s> Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
<s> How can I?  No matter where I go, there'll always be a Shell station on the corner.  I'll bring this back when it's empty.
<s> I come to the old lady's funeral.
<s> Coffee?
<s> Who's going to raid a funeral?
<s> Me?  I'm just a customer here.
<s> Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
<s> Big joke!
<s> That's an opera, you ignoramus.
<s> So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
<s> No, Spats - no, no, no -  NO!
<s> Bacardi 151.
<s> When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Dont worry about it.
<s> Im not as square as my daughter thinks.
<s> Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
<s> Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.
<s> Oh, hello.
<s> No, tell me.
<s> Sorry, can you give us a moment?
<s> I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
<s> I shagged Amy. Two years ago. Thats why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
<s> He was pretty drunk, but I think hes still crazy about you.
<s> Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
<s> I have a friend at the magazine.
<s> If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
<s> Ive got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think its the words: morally repugnant.
<s> We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
<s> Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
<s> Oh, cut the crap!
<s> He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
<s> Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now youll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
<s> What?! No, no. You cant--
<s> Therapist.
<s> I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. Youre here for the highland flings, I bet.
<s> That's where we come from first?
<s> He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
<s> You could? How?
<s> What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
<s> Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
<s> Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
<s> They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
<s> Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
<s> Where was you, Daddy?
<s> I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
<s> Come here, son...
<s> Soon -- but it won't be too much huntin' you'll be doin','cordin' to a good little story your mama told me last night -- you'll be goin' away from here, won't you?
<s> Then why don't he holler like he usta?
<s> Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
<s> You sure can, son...
<s> Miss Johnson is a teacher, and...
<s> How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
<s> Come in, children.
<s> Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
<s> Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
<s> Might be...
<s> What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
<s> Ike, you could make a song outta that!
<s> Well, let's get to it, Miss Rebecca,'cause I been waitin' too long a time for your good cookin'!
<s> To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
<s> It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
<s> Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
<s> You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
<s> Will they give him a trial?
<s> The Canadians are just mad that we mothers here in South Park have the chutzpah to stand up to them!  Like it or not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children are now safe from your Canadian smut!
<s> Montana.
<s> I said -
<s> Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
<s> I saw him last night!
<s> Sheet!
<s> Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
<s> Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
<s> Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-
<s> But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem!
<s> Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
<s> This is it! The time for action is NOW!!  <b>Something must be done! This is like a spreading rash! They're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of smut and sex and poo! I believe the good fight has begun! Something must be done!</b>
<s> A hunger strike? For what?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Hey, Chef.
<s> No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
<s> Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
<s> Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.
<s> Uhh... Bacon.
<s> Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
<s> What's a dying giraffe sound like?
<s> We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
<s> Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
<s> Our moms suck!
<s> What's the difference?
<s> What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
<s> Wow!
<s> Huh?
<s> Yes?
<s> No, it was worse than that...
<s> You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
<s> Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
<s> Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
<s> Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
<s> <b>Hey, guy, relax, put out! You gotta relax, shut your mouth- Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time-</b>
<s> Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?
<s> God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
<s> Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
<s> Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
<s> He's shutting off the air!!!
<s> Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
<s> Oh yeah...
<s> Oh Sara...
<s> Very professional of you.
<s> You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
<s> I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
<s> Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.
<s> Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
<s> Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
<s> Uh...
<s> What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
<s> Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?
<s> Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
<s> I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
<s> Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
<s> Like open an airlock by mistake?
<s> Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
<s> Well maybe there's a way out of here.
<s> Just considering our options... sir.
<s> Seen one like it before?
<s> Why can't we?
<s> Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
<s> Even if we do, it might be too late.
<s> I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
<s> Barnes?
<s> Over and out.
<s> And so far.
<s> It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
<s> Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
<s> Send it back if you don't want it.
<s> What are you going to do about it?
<s> One moment please...  one moment please...
<s> Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
<s> Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service.
<s> Nope.
<s> Can I get you something for the road?
<s> When you get a chance.
<s> I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
<s> How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
<s> It was a clearance.
<s> But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
<s> Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
<s> Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
<s> I'd buy it!
<s> brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch.  And now we got a beautiful thing.
<s> Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
<s> I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.
<s> She's my mom.
<s> I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.
<s> kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.
<s> What's it look like to you?
<s> I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
<s> I'm getting to like it here.
<s> I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
<s> He says that to all his wives.
<s> Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
<s> Millie, I know what I'm doing.
<s> Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
<s> You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
<s> Who's there?
<s> Someone wants to play with me?
<s> If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other.
<s> What ever happened to just bowling?
<s> Why would you help me?
<s> Look who's talking!
<s> Who wants to know?  Zeus!
<s> I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
<s> Whips...orange whips.
<s> Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
<s> I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
<s> I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
<s> If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
<s> Zip.
<s> Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
<s> It's Junior, isn't it.
<s> I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
<s> I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
<s> Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
<s> I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?
<s> Tell your little pal to let go.
<s> Open it, Captain!
<s> Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
<s> What if it attacks?
<s> Do you see it?
<s> Nothing else.
<s> Press?  No, I haven't.
<s> I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
<s> But sir, I think it's imperative.  I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related.
<s> Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
<s> Harry?  Can you copy?
<s> Then how can it be chipped?
<s> So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
<s> He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
<s> What are you going to do -- shoot her?
<s> Radiation shield, you think?
<s> Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.
<s> Too big?
<s> C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
<s> Underwater?
<s> What -- are you threatening me?
<s> Good theory, Ted.
<s> Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
<s> Beth.
<s> I have to reset the sub.
<s> Why should I go?
<s> I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
<s> I think so, Beth.  Yes.
<s> We must've had it delivered then.
<s> What?
<s> You think, in the sphere --
<s> Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
<s> Something for burns.
<s> Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
<s> You want to kill him?
<s> Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
<s> Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
<s> You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
<s> When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
<s> It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
<s> Beth -- gimme the gun.
<s> By the bunks.
<s> For whoever's in that thing.
<s> Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
<s> We can refuse to talk.
<s> Wait a second, I --
<s> Whatever I can do to help.
<s> Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
<s> What are they?
<s> There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
<s> Harry?
<s> Shut up and catch.
<s> I'm trying to keep balance with --
<s> You got her?
<s> I'm trying.  There.
<s> It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
<s> Please.  It must have flown here --
<s> It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming "witchcraft".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
<s> The others, sir?
<s> No, they didn't say --
<s> He's a pussy.
<s> You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
<s> You mean a picture?
<s> This is like nursery school.
<s> The creature?
<s> Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
<s> Four.  Four years --
<s> I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
<s> Who's going to pay me then?
<s> All right then, we'll use your plan.
<s> ... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
<s> We'll be back before you are, old man.
<s> You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
<s> But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
<s> Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
<s> He's bluffing...
<s> These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
<s> I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
<s> At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
<s> I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
<s> I'll make a report later.
<s> That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.
<s> It's automatic.
<s> Come back here... Where are you going?
<s> I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.
<s> Who is this?  What's your operating...
<s> They'll find its weakness.
<s> You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
<s> He'll be well cared for.
<s> Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
<s> Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
<s> In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.
<s> Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
<s> Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
<s> Funny...
<s> Excuse me...!
<s> It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
<s> How do I know if this is love ?
<s> Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
<s> I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
<s> I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
<s> Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
<s> Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
<s> Flip six, three hole.
<s> Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
<s> That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
<s> I'm gonna need a squad leader.
<s> A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
<s> Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
<s> I won't quit !
<s> Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
<s> Here in Buenos Aires.
<s> Courage, I guess.
<s> Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
<s> I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
<s> I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
<s> This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
<s> Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
<s> We're not leaving you here, sir !
<s> Give'em hell, sir !
<s> The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
<s> Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
<s> Yes, sir, I'll do that.
<s> Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
<s> Mr Decker....
<s> The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
<s> Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
<s> That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
<s> It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
<s> Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead...!
<s> Our Exec and Science Officer...
<s> Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
<s> Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
<s> Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
<s> And whatever you sensed out here....
<s> But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
<s> Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
<s> No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
<s> That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
<s> Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
<s> To you, sir?
<s> Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> Why did you quit?
<s> It's about life.
<s> First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.

<s> You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
<s> What are they offering?
<s> That's so beautiful...
<s> Where have you been...
<s> Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
<s> Who is this person that you've found?
<s> Hope to tell you.  Didn't I pick the fragments of glass out of Bob Barrenger's actual head myself.
<s> Whatever it is.  GO <u>do</u> it.  How you doing on the permit?
<s> You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
<s> What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
<s> This horse is booked.

<s> Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.
<s> Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
<s> I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
<s> Then, you <u>write</u> that.  And then this is <u>our</u> second chance.  That's why we're here...
<s> Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
<s> He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
<s> You want me to lie.
<s> It's not <u>you</u>, it's...

<s> That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
<s> Givvem a cigarette...
<s> I don't care.
<s> Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.
<s> Or blush.  You look pale.
<s> I'll be there for you.
<s> ...I'm not deaf, y'know.
<s> And...?
<s> Great.
<s> Not with my mouth open.
<s> I'm not.
<s> Here.
<s> I'm almost done making it.  Alright Ben -- <u>you</u> deal with the tardy, <u>you</u> write yourself a note, your daddy <u>told</u> you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were AAAAGGGGHHHH!
<s> This is my daddy's house --
<s> Annabelle pick up the phone.
<s> Then have a donut --
<s> How could I be?  We learned some magic...
<s> IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
<s> I have lava.
<s> No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
<s> Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
<s> I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
<s> You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
<s> Sooner than later.  You really need to.
<s> Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
<s> But you're not <u>done</u>!
<s> We don't KNOW if you've got it, we haven't SEEN it yet!  Now go back and FINISH!
<s> I'm here.
<s> Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
<s> Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
<s> Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
<s> Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
<s> We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
<s> <u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
<s> WE are over.
<s> Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
<s> A lot smaller.
<s> This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
<s> What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
<s> ...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
<s> No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
<s> I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
<s> Why not just bring the whole toilet?
<s> Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
<s> You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
<s> You're taking the kids.  And moving to San Francisco.
<s> You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
<s> Ironic, huh?
<s> Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
<s> Is that what he told you?
<s> Who in the world <u>is</u> he?
<s> Aw.
<s> So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
<s> She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.
<s> You're the hip and fresh.
<s> Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
<s> It was a veal stock, I thi...
<s> Yeh, it's cheaper.
<s> I trust you of course I do but --
<s> Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...
<s> It's no biggie.
<s> It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
<s> How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily?
<s> Great to be here.
<s> Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
<s> I'm still poor.
<s> I'm always working.
<s> My grandchild-baby.
<s> Jesus was not bad.
<s> I know!
<s> Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
<s> Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
<s> Fine.
<s> You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
<s> You know he hated my story also.
<s> Man, it's just, like, conversation.
<s> OK!
<s> Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
<s> I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
<s> None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
<s> 'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
<s> That's what I was gonna ask you.
<s> Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
<s> Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
<s> No, thanks.
<s> No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
<s> Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
<s> Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
<s> Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
<s> Why? Are we going dancing?
<s> Who's got matches?
<s> We don't have time!
<s> I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
<s> Used to Filmore, used to.
<s> Because I'll be firing at them.
<s> Are you going to kill us?
<s> Like where--in your dreams?
<s> Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
<s> Chemco is willing to deal with him, meet his demands.  I can have the money there in an hour.
<s> The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
<s> I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
<s> What the hell is it, anyhow?
<s> I say we head out.
<s> Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
<s> Dissent?
<s> We can't--it's power driven!
<s> Did you get that, Kulnick?
<s> Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
<s> Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
<s> Now look here, Miss Pietraszkiewicz, this is Air Command Headquarters calling.
<s> General Schmuck, we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from Burpelson Air Force Base, HQ 843rd Wing.  It was apparently directed to their Wing on air- borne alert.  It decoded as - Wing attack, Plan-R.
<s> To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
<s> I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
<s> Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
<s> No, sir.
<s> General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
<s> That's right, Major.
<s> I know that, sir.
<s> If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
<s> I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
<s> Well, sir, I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year, given average luck it would fail in thirty years.
<s> Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
<s> I presume the planes are armed?
<s> What the hell is Plan-R?
<s> Why can't you cancel it?
<s> We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.
<s> I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.
<s> Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
<s> Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
<s> Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
<s> Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
<s> Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
<s> Speed?
<s> Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
<s> They're moving apart.
<s> Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
<s> First safety.
<s> Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
<s> I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
<s> Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
<s> Why should they call us back?
<s> Look, this is different.
<s> Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.
<s> You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
<s> Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
<s> But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
<s> Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
<s> Knock yourself out.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
<s> It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
<s> Was it okay?
<s> What did you guys think?
<s> Why is everything about you, Jeff?
<s> Oh.
<s> Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
<s> Now?
<s> What?
<s> Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
<s> Uh, last night...
<s> No, no, no.
<s> Yeah, right, publicist.
<s> You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
<s> Hey, don't tell us about private property. This is America, my friend.
<s> So, how was the ride, kids?
<s> Alright, Pony!
<s> We're your customers. We're not complaining.
<s> You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
<s> No, no, whoa!
<s> You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
<s> No, not really. Middle-class.
<s> Maybe upper-middle-class.
<s> What'd he get you?
<s> Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...
<s> Thank you.
<s> Because I'm alienated.
<s> Sooze wants to see him.
<s> Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
<s> Ask your girlfriend.
<s> Oh, shit.
<s> Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
<s> I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.
<s> Good, good. I, I hope he does.
<s> Okay. Nazeer, okay?
<s> I don't know. I think she's breathing.
<s> It's a piece.
<s> Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
<s> About what?
<s> No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
<s> Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
<s> I would've stopped it.
<s> No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
<s> Nothing.
<s> Mm-hm.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Mm.
<s> Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
<s> No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
<s> But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
<s> Wait. What, what are you saying?
<s> Nah, nah, nah, nah.
<s> No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
<s> Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
<s> Oh, yeah.
<s> Well, what about this?
<s> Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
<s> Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.
<s> No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
<s> I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Mine too.
<s> You done?
<s> Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
<s> Yeah?
<s> I'm here.
<s> You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
<s> Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
<s> There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".
<s> Don't swear it's impolite.
<s> Shut up, Cleo.  Di, how much do you need for an abortion?
<s> It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
<s> Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true."  Right?
<s> And they get caught!
<s> Of course - of course!  Hands in...
<s> Yeah.
<s> Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
<s> But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
<s> Jus some girlie things for the squad.
<s> Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
<s> Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
<s> That you?
<s> Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
<s> Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
<s> Right.  That'll be fifteen hundred - cash.
<s> It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
<s> Definitely old.
<s> Maybe we can make a deal.
<s> Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
<s> I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
<s> That was the general idea.
<s> Close, but no cigar.
<s> I'll take it.
<s> Don't worry.  She's just a fan for my literary output.
<s> I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
<s> What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
<s> Phillip, you're mad!
<s> You'll be waiting for me?
<s> I'll make it short.
<s> And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
<s> What were you -- a child actress?
<s> Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
<s> I just don't.
<s> You did.
<s> Why did she call me?
<s> No.
<s> Come on, Joe.
<s> Hello, Mr. deMille.
<s> Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.
<s> Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
<s> We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
<s> I know your face.  You're Norma Desmond.  You used to be in pictures.  You used to be big.
<s> That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
<s> Get out!
<s> Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
<s> Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.
<s> Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
<s> There's something wrong with your car, you said.
<s> Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
<s> Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
<s> Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
<s> Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
<s> Cute.  Let's have some drinks.
<s> There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
<s> Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
<s> Yes, I am, Norma.
<s> It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
<s> No, they don't.
<s> Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
<s> Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
<s> Right with you.
<s> You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
<s> No, that was me.  I said, Who wants to see a Civil War picture?
<s> Along is no good.  I need it now.
<s> Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
<s> Yes, Madame.
<s> Who?
<s> Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
<s> But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
<s> She didn't take it from you, did she?
<s> There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
<s> Later.
<s> What's that?
<s> Well...I guess one is all right.
<s> You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
<s> Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
<s> Just like that?
<s> It seemed that way to me.
<s> I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
<s> But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
<s> I don't want your help.
<s> I could force you.
<s> Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
<s> Supergirl?
<s> Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
<s> He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
<s> It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> She's a beast.
<s> It was just a trim.
<s> Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
<s> Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
<s> You Scorpios can never take a joke.
<s> I have to talk to you.
<s> Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
<s> ...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
<s> I know.
<s> Then come with me.
<s> Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!
<s> Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
<s> For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
<s> The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
<s> I didn't --
<s> But Lana, you could --
<s> Who?
<s> Oh...I came close once.
<s> I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
<s> Can I help?
<s> But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
<s> Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
<s> Oh?
<s> What's that?
<s> What are you doing?
<s> They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
<s> Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
<s> First paycheck?
<s> So where is all them half-centses?
<s> Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
<s> Which country?
<s> A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
<s> That what they call you?
<s> KRYPTONITE!
<s> I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
<s> What will it do?
<s> Tell me more...
<s> Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
<s> Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
<s> Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
<s> That's his sister. Vera Webster.
<s> Anytime.
<s> Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
<s> Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
<s> I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
<s> Tell me.
<s> Turn on the light.
<s> How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
<s> Where's the handle?
<s> My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
<s> We already have a super-tanker.
<s> We can get to work on that oil!
<s> Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
<s> Don't bet on it!
<s> Lois, you're amazing.
<s> Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
<s> Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
<s> Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
<s> But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
<s> Does she know about it? She's in it!
<s> A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
<s> He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
<s> Yes, but it's not all I feel.
<s> Now This I want to hear.
<s> Sensible enough.
<s> I asked the right question.
<s> I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
<s> North.
<s> That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
<s> I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
<s> Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
<s> Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
<s> Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance.  Beginning with this one.
<s> You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
<s> Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
<s> Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
<s> No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
<s> No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
<s> If you say so. Here goes.
<s> Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
<s> You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
<s> Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
<s> Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
<s> I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
<s> Our other dinner guest.
<s> He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
<s> Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
<s> I must have miscalculated. How. . .
<s> My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
<s> You are . . .
<s> I made you, and I can destroy you.
<s> Destiny.
<s> Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
<s> Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
<s> Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
<s> Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
<s> Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
<s> Lois isn't here?
<s> North. It's north
<s> Huh?
<s> Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
<s> You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
<s> I read the article.
<s> See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
<s> Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
<s> You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
<s> I know...
<s> Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
<s> Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
<s> I'm wearing it.
<s> What other one?
<s> This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
<s> Gets you where you live, huh?
<s> On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
<s> All of us.
<s> Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
<s> Enjoyed it?
<s> Oh, God! I'm going to die!
<s> Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
<s> 195 pounds.
<s> No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared.  What are you waiting for?
<s> We'll see how fast I can fly.
<s> I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
<s> It turns to steaming piss.
<s> That's okay.
<s> Nothing.  We made it to the hospital.  I didn't have to go as far as I was prepared to.  But I was prepared to go all the way.
<s> No you don't.
<s> Not unless you can raise the dead.
<s> She's resting.  In her room.
<s> Billy, that's too early.
<s> A while.
<s> I better get back.
<s> Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
<s> Why?
<s> Berry-picking.
<s> What's that, Dolores?
<s> I did.
<s> What other people?
<s> Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
<s> Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
<s> A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
<s> No.  A little sugar though.
<s> No.  What's this lawyer business?
<s> So he was mean?
<s> Was the bus on time?
<s> And what was the weather like at this time?
<s> ...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
<s> There's the Prescots...
<s> Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
<s> What do they do?
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> Thanks.
<s> So what's the problem?
<s> You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
<s> No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.
<s> You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.
<s> Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
<s> Who did they get for that?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best.
<s> Do you have this agreement with you?
<s> Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.
<s> Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by.
<s> You remember that much?
<s> Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly now.  It seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  I was scared.
<s> Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm telling it.
<s> But you didn't lose me.
<s> What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
<s> Great.
<s> How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
<s> The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
<s> Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
<s> Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
<s> And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
<s> No, I'm not.  I'm not!
<s> I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
<s> I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
<s> Are you finished?
<s> Can't hurt...
<s> No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor!  The manager yes, but not the boy.
<s> Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
<s> The man in jail is always for freedom.
<s> Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt!  Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd like it fine if you found another home.  That means the front door is open!  Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT!  And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage!  You're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men!
<s> You're incapable of the truth...
<s> At the bar - Sidney...
<s> No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
<s> In his apartment -
<s> But, Sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning!
<s> Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you!  And so do I!  I need his column--tonight.  Didn't you ask me to do something about your job?  Don't you have a kid in Military School?
<s> Help me with two minutes of silence!
<s> Yes.
<s> I know you do, Sidney.
<s> Begging your pardon, I haven't been down the bowery in years!
<s> Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
<s> It is a favor, isn't it?
<s> You tell him, I stutter!
<s> Yes, but why?
<s> But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.
<s> I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -
<s> Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest this kid for larceny!
<s> He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
<s> Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
<s> NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
<s> In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?
<s> Now listen to me very carefully.
<s> My mission is to protect you.
<s> I would.
<s> Why?
<s> What?
<s> Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
<s> Terminated.
<s> I'm sorry, John.
<s> I love you, John.  I always have.
<s> Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
<s> Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
<s> I'm sure it feels very real to you --
<s> Eating is eating... and...
<s> I don't know.
<s> Five minutes.
<s> But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
<s> A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
<s> What is this, Emmi?
<s> Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
<s> I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
<s> May I ask a question?
<s> Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
<s> Tell me about von der Null.
<s> And what did he say?
<s> I don't understand what you mean.
<s> One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
<s> You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
<s> One of my people?
<s> The Miracle Kid.
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't know what you mean, Major.
<s> Nope.
<s> First oboe.
<s> Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
<s> The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
<s> It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
<s> What's it to ya?
<s> I don't understand...
<s> Kyle.
<s> White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
<s> What?
<s> John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...
<s> And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
<s> Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
<s> Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
<s> I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...
<s> Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
<s> You must have had a fun child-
<s> I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
<s> No.  Never.
<s> Of course.
<s> Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
<s> I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
<s> No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
<s> Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
<s> There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
<s> "Whereas once I was blind, now I can see."  Night, Nick.  Best of luck.
<s> Please, don't do that...
<s> Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> It was a gift... from my brother.
<s> If there was one.
<s> Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
<s> No.
<s> My hero.  Let's go.
<s> I thought...
<s> I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
<s> What... what do you mean?
<s> You call them...
<s> What are you doing?
<s> Stop it!
<s> I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
<s> Like... where are you from?
<s> Big family... small?
<s> Studied acting, I assume?
<s> Elizabeth?
<s> "Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
<s> Why?
<s> This isn't an escort service?
<s> Okay.
<s> They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
<s> You're part of it...
<s> Yes, very lucky.
<s> A game?
<s> What kind of vacation?
<s> And if nothing's lacking?
<s> What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.
<s> Like, this way... sort of...
<s> The key?
<s> Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
<s> Did you worry about him?
<s> It was a misunderstanding.
<s> You know you can.
<s> Nothing else?
<s> It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here?
<s> Well, I... uh...
<s> I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Why?
<s> Do we still get paid for the week?
<s> Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
<s> You want company?
<s> She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
<s> This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
<s> That smell... oh, God.
<s> I got more scared.
<s> I don't know.
<s> It was.
<s> It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?
<s> Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please.
<s> Test it.
<s> How'd I know it was for you?
<s> That?  That's Hill House.
<s> Nell, what do we do?
<s> Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
<s> Who?
<s> Fifteen dollars.
<s> That's why we're here.
<s> A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
<s> The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?
<s> You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
<s> Well?
<s> I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
<s> It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
<s> Like you.
<s> For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
<s> We all did.
<s> All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
<s> Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
<s> Let him break - he likes to break.
<s> Round about, yeah.
<s> No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.
<s> Terry Valentine.
<s> Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
<s> She didn't write to me, did she.
<s> Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
<s> Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know.  Just popped over on a quick visit.
<s> How'd the two of you hook up, then?
<s> Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
<s> <u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party.
<s> Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
<s> What post office?
<s> Not much -- you?
<s> No, but I know what he means.
<s> I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went.  It must've been the bars.
<s> Not ashamed.
<s> Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
<s> Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
<s> Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
<s> -- Mr. Lindgren.
<s> Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
<s> Why not.
<s> What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
<s> I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
<s> Just now?  Overnight?
<s> Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
<s> I've 'ardly ever left it.
<s> You sound like my fucking probation officer.
<s> She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
<s> I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
<s> Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
<s> Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
<s> My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
<s> He had urgent business in the north.
<s> Sorry.  Wasn't me.
<s> The forever kind.
<s> I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
<s> "He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
<s> Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
<s> I doubt it.
<s> I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
<s> Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
<s> Yes, Ann?
<s> We've certainly missed you.
<s> Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
<s> Look, I'm no expert, but--
<s> I'll have it in a week.
<s> Ed.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Sure.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> $10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
<s> Come on in.
<s> Mm.
<s> I didn't say a word.
<s> Honey...
<s> What happened to you?
<s> He and Doris... were having an affair.
<s> I... just knew. A husband knows.
<s> ...a puny player on the great world's stage...
<s> ...who among us is in a position to say...
<s> Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.
<s> Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
<s> I know who you are, Mr Crane.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
<s> Let's go!
<s> The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
<s> That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
<s> Where the hell are you?
<s> Where's the head?
<s> Whose footprints?
<s> I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
<s> You're kidding.
<s> The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
<s> Pardon my French, but bull shit.
<s> Not so loud.
<s> I don't know.  I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.
<s> I'm not giving up.
<s> That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
<s> Look who's here, Margo.
<s> I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
<s> Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
<s> Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
<s> He's right.  Follow me.
<s> But at what a price.
<s> Frock's been fired.
<s> Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
<s> What's that?
<s> Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
<s> An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
<s> And John?
<s> What happened?
<s> What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
<s> I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
<s> Would you mind showing it to me?
<s> I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
<s> I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
<s> It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
<s> You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
<s> I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
<s> What's to see?
<s> Do it!
<s> Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
<s> A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
<s> Shhh!
<s> <i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
<s> How about them?
<s> I told you I can't.
<s> Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?
<s> Yeah...
<s> I've been thinking--
<s> I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
<s> Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
<s> Good night, Mother.
<s> Surgery.  The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night.  Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors.  Non-union contractors.  Monsters.  We're starting with an amputation.
<s> You blaming me for the traffic?
<s> I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
<s> They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow--
<s> Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
<s> Does what?
<s> I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
<s> Working with?
<s> Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
<s> Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
<s> Into what?
<s> Looking for him for what?
<s> What's that?
<s> Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
<s> Show you right on a map.
<s> No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
<s> Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
<s> S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
<s> When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
<s> Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
<s> Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
<s> What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.
<s> I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
<s> We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
<s> Mulder --
<s> This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
<s> No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
<s> All the equipment is brand new.
<s> Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
<s> I need you on this, Scully --
<s> That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
<s> General McAddie's.
<s> And they want to blame us?
<s> I've got to find Scully.
<s> What happened to Kurtzweil?
<s> A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
<s> The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
<s> No.  No.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> I don't need them anymore...
<s> This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
<s> He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.
<s> Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
<s> Absolutely.  Abigail...
<s> It doesn't matter...
<s> I got it.
<s> Mocky-Lock.
<s> Delano?
<s> Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.
<s> I think that's the whole point.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
<s> Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
<s> She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it.
<s> Do you understand German?
<s> I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
<s> Dr. Winkel told me that.
<s> He was Harry's driver?
<s> It's just what he used to say.
<s> If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
<s> There isn't enough for two laughs.
<s> His.
<s> From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
<s> Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
<s> Yes.
<s> They're Harry's.
<s> We loved each other, do you mean that?
<s> I don't know.
<s> They'll be returned, miss.
<s> This is forgery. It is very clever.
<s> No, not yet.
<s> Ever seen one?
<s> It wasn't petrol.
<s> Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
<s> In Vienna...
<s> I'm not asking you to.
<s> Two thirty.
<s> I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
<s> I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
<s> Goodness, that's awkward.
<s> Certainly.
<s> It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
<s> Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
<s> What is it, Sergeant?
<s> Who?
<s> You wouldn't do anything.
<s> Tension? KURTZ Suspense.
<s> Here?
<s> But you will.
<s> Must be some mistake.
<s> Why didn't they bring him in the house?
<s> Ah, er war gleich tot - I mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
<s> Now, hold on.
<s> That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
<s> Oh.
<s> Here.
<s> So?
<s> We're ok.
<s> I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
<s> You can swim?
<s> Not too bad.
<s> Hi there. Here, take a look.
<s> So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
<s> Where did you lose it?
<s> I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
<s> Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
<s> The Zionists aren't Nazis.
<s> They sound like you.
<s> What??
<s> Who the fuck are you?
<s> Danny, it's true. There were no six million. At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps. And the majority of them were from disease and --
<s> At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
<s> Killing himself.
<s> Yes, I am. Basically I am.
<s> No.
<s> What's it mean?
<s> Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
<s> It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
<s> No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
<s> Do they?
<s> Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
<s> I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff...  Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like...
<s> Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
<s> And be crushed.
<s> I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
<s> Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
<s> That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
<s> German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
<s> I don't know. Is that right?
<s> Everybody likes to, don't they?
<s> Why?
<s> Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
<s> So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
<s> Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
<s> Listen to me....
<s> To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
<s> I can't help what I think.
<s> You're lying.
<s> Fucking kike.
<s> So what Jew would you kill first?
<s> You could do it.
<s> You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
<s> It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
<s> Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
<s> Get out of my way.
<s> I didn't. I told you, I can't --
<s> Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
<s> ...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
<s> Dennis Leary.
<s> Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?
<s> None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
<s> Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
<s> Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
<s> I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
<s> Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
<s> The documents are forged.
<s> Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
<s> No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
<s> Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
<s> Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
<s> ... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
<s> You know what I'm talking about.
<s> Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
<s> No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
<s> The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
<s> Have the car painted.
<s> Noireuter.
<s> It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
<s> Fine!
<s> What room have you got?
<s> ... You married?
<s> Everything about what?
<s> As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
<s> The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
<s> Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
<s> You say that because you have the title!
<s> Well that's very nice of you.
<s> It's too loud for me.
<s> Thank you...
<s> I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
<s> It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
<s> ... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
<s> I saw how it has to be.
<s> Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
<s> I brought Johana to meet you.
<s> Louis, we were French!
<s> I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
<s> Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
<s> I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
<s> What do you want me to do?
<s> I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
<s> Mordechai!
<s> Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
<s> The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
<s> Whoa, whoa there. C'mon Mordechai, is this any way to treat an old family friend? Let's cut out all the unpleasantness. I admit, I went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing. Let me make it up to you. How about a peace offering?  Girls.
<s> I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you!
<s> It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.
<s> What about me?
<s> It don't look like a leopard to me.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
<s> You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
<s> What are you doing that for?
<s> When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
<s> That's right, of course.
<s> It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
<s> But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
<s> Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
<s> Just barely possible - - yes.
<s> Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
<s> I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
<s> Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone 
<s> No - really, I can see them -- they're coming now - turn off the lights 
<s> Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
<s> Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
<s> Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
<s> Now look what you've done.
<s> I don't know  a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
<s> You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
<s> He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
<s> I know. Funerals.
<s> If that's being a softie -- there are two of us.
<s> Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
<s> You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
<s> Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
<s> You... You found that at Leons?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
<s> Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
<s> The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
<s> Have you finished?
<s> No!
<s> Leon hung himself.
<s> ...You-you spoke to him?
<s> I didnt know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? Ive known for five years. Hes known Ive known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesnt speak about...
<s> You bastard...
<s> Simplify and damn.
<s> What are you doing? You cant. I...
<s> You wouldnt understand.
<s> Well, Id sooner mug an old lady...
<s> French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didnt have any. I used a British passport. My names not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
<s> Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
<s> Whos the guy? Whos the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate Id have had to kill him.
<s> What...  Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. Theres a lot of people back there. Theyre holding a seminar. Traffickings the past, breeding the future...
<s> So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
<s> That-that wont do. Thats not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, thats the way...
<s> A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think Ill get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, itll be too late.
<s> You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
<s> Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
<s> Finsbury Park. Were in Finsbury Park.
<s> The company. We all work for the company.
<s> B-Black...
<s> La what?
<s> Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, thats what they do to their employees, isnt it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining peoples lives. Thanks for the lift!
<s> May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
<s> Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldnt like to think Id kept you waiting for nothing.
<s> Okay. Recommended...
<s> Anything at all?
<s> Huh. Id have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientle. Get rid of them and were out of business.
<s> Huh... Im sure thered be lots of takers.
<s> I told you... The rabble, its me...  Huh... Its sad.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Should I come back in five minutes?
<s> The ladys not a friend. Shes a whore.  Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies.
<s> Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leons not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.
<s> My sister... She lives in the next valley.
<s> Yes...You-youre not going to take Shiva away?
<s> Im sorry. Its just you dont look local...
<s> ... No. In fact, Id seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasnt getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
<s> Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesnt appeal to you...
<s> Huh! You turned him into a liability, didnt you know?
<s> If he had, youd be dead.
<s> Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didnt need your confession...
<s> Dont tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
<s> I dont know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
<s> Of course I am, it's just that...
<s> No.  I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
<s> You make it sound so simple...
<s> No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
<s> Yes...
<s> I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
<s> Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
<s> I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
<s> I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you.
<s> My name is Jeanne.  My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me.  I would like to have it back.
<s> These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
<s> Many things...
<s> And may I go to Mass?
<s> And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
<s> And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
<s> For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.
<s> I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
<s> Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
<s> My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
<s> ... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone.
<s> If there was, I didn't see it...
<s> That's not a lot.
<s> I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
<s> I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
<s> I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
<s> That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
<s> Here -- take this instead.
<s> Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
<s> ... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
<s> My king.
<s> Five steeds and a few hackneys...
<s> Playing...
<s> I -- I -- I...
<s> I might ask you the same question.
<s> I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
<s> What do you mean, they won't come?
<s> What are you doing on the wall?
<s> What for?
<s> No...
<s> Yes, my lord.
<s> There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
<s> I'm sure he'll forgive you.
<s> Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
<s> Yes, it is.
<s> It's like this... I...we...all of them.
<s> You can't, it's too dangerous.
<s> My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
<s> Dead.
<s> American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
<s> What?
<s> Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
<s> Who's recruiting?
<s> Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
<s> Yes, please.
<s> Do they?
<s> Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
<s> Warsaw's not the only radio station.
<s> We use what?
<s> You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
<s> Yes, but what good did it do?
<s> So, what's the news?
<s> You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
<s> Toilets?
<s> You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
<s> Can you help? I've no money...
<s> It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
<s> The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
<s> Watch your feet!
<s> There is something to be said for silence
<s> Someone died here. It's tapu.
<s> Nothing just yet
<s> No.
<s> What are they?
<s> I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
<s> She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
<s> On your piano, that is the swap.
<s> She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
<s> You've missed this bit.
<s> Tomorrow.
<s> Do I know any gigs?
<s> That's right.
<s> Who told ya this guy was in here?
<s> How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
<s> You think my play is bad?
<s> What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
<s> Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
<s> Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet.  I can go halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.
<s> You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
<s> The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way.
<s> Forget it.
<s> What about the other one?
<s> Hackers.
<s> Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
<s> You mean you blew it.
<s> He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either.  You played the Big Con since then.
<s> Well we got some workin' money anyway.
<s> No, not a thing.
<s> Did he hold you up on anything?
<s> Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
<s> Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?
<s> Raise 5,000.
<s> If ya win it could make ya, too.
<s> You're more gutless than I thought.
<s> But what about all these other people?
<s> Where's June today?
<s> What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
<s> Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted.
<s> Three grand on the black, Jimmy.
<s> 660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
<s> Give 'em a little time.
<s> How am I gonna do that?
<s> No.
<s> I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
<s> Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
<s> He'll never do it.
<s> Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
<s> You know how they are... sex...
<s> Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
<s> He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.
<s> I can't find him.  I've tried everything.  I thought you might know.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Go!
<s> You're talking like a crazy person,
<s> Do you know where he's living?  Oh....  Well, at least I'm glad he's all right.  Thank you for calling. Goodbye.
<s> You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
<s> Shush!
<s> What do you mean?
<s> was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
<s> Oh, thank heaven.
<s> What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
<s> Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
<s> I bought it in a pawn shop.
<s> That's the truth.
<s> Better get home before it is.
<s> We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
<s> We were looking for this bird.
<s> What's he want of you?
<s> What's that to you?
<s> I'm asking you.
<s> So you say -  Go on, Bob.
<s> I'll have to try to remember.
<s> I'll check on that.  I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
<s> Let's go and see.  Taxi!
<s> I think we're on the right track.
<s> I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
<s> Did you go?
<s> I see.
<s> Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
<s> I said all right!
<s> Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
<s> Don't you remember....
<s> Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
<s> Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
<s> But suppose some business comes up...
<s> I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
<s> Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
<s> Hello, Mimi.
<s> Well, don't you?
<s> Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
<s> He didn't say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.
<s> I didn't knock Julia off.
<s> She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
<s> I had him out this morning.
<s> If you like 'em like that.
<s> Santa Claus.
<s> Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
<s> Yes.
<s> Can't you get to sleep?
<s> Maybe a drink would help you.
<s> All right... shoot!  I mean... what's on your mind?
<s> Want a drink?
<s> Your guess is as good as mine.
<s> I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
<s> Sure.
<s> Got a nice evening dress?
<s> I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
<s> I wish you'd tell me.
<s> I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
<s> It's the only way it makes sense.
<s> No, Mr. Charles.
<s> I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
<s> Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
<s> Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
<s> No... no.
<s> Baghdad.
<s> This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
<s> Wha...
<s> We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
<s> You just go when I say go.
<s> Let me see the map.
<s> Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--
<s> So we wait.
<s> You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
<s> I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?
<s> You don't know that.
<s> It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
<s> Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
<s> Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
<s> Knock it off!
<s> What we're doing is kicking ass.  For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews.  The war is over.  We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.
<s> We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
<s> We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
<s> I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
<s> I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!
<s> Epps...
<s> Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
<s> So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
<s> I hope it means something, otherwise...
<s> They can't shoot us in here.
<s> Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.
<s> What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
<s> Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.
<s> It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
<s> Forget Wes.
<s> Wes is dead!
<s> We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.
<s> I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
<s> Yeah.  Well, me too.
<s> Yeah.
<s> The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
<s> Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
<s> I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
<s> I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
<s> We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
<s> With what?  Against how many?
<s> When did you make the switch?
<s> What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
<s> A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
<s> A headache?
<s> I'm saying don't do it accidently.
<s> Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
<s> Now you need me.
<s> Oh, God!
<s> ...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
<s> Then lets go back while we still can.
<s> You have to go with us, Wes.
<s> He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
<s> He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
<s> We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
<s> What's the matter with you?
<s> He wants me to come to his quarters.
<s> I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
<s> Look,dirt!
<s> What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.
<s> Don't take anything.
<s> Don't let them separate us.
<s> We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed.  You can work with us.  An organized plan of escape must be devised first.  Could you see anything?  You want to leave.  You're not like them.  You must have left something, or someone.
<s> What?
<s> You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
<s> But you can't...you.
<s> What?
<s> We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore.  Who are you?
<s> I'm all right THX rises and they begin to walk along the passageway. At the end of the hall is a small metal door, a sign read "Level 842CON G, Division of Plastic, Vendable manufacturing stations" the door is jammed and it is difficult to open.  Finally the latch snaps and the door swings open.
<s> No!....
<s> What do you want?
<s> ....going well.  How could I be so wrong.  SCO 1202 cross wired a 904.  He's been receiving extra credit.  He offered me some.
<s> -Where?
<s> Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
<s> Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
<s> Oh yeah? Prove it.
<s> I don't know. You tell me?
<s> Sounds like terrorist heaven.
<s> Just how easy is it to build a... device?
<s> Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
<s> I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things... 
<s> Where you guys at?
<s> Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
<s> You got it.
<s> Stay to your left.
<s> Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.
<s> A bowling alley.
<s> We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
<s> Stay in the truck.
<s> A ticking bomb...
<s> Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
<s> Look who's talking, old man.
<s> One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
<s> My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?
<s> Goddamit, Reilly--
<s> I thought I told you--
<s> It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
<s> In a moment.
<s> That's just what I tried to tell him. Well, one word led to another. He really was a very charming fellow. So we talked for about ten minutes.
<s> You see--  No, no! And <u>yet</u>--  <u>Did</u> I--did--now <u>where</u> could we have--
<s> No.
<s> Amsterdam?
<s> Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
<s> Yes, Baron. Thank you. 
<s> Um-hum ...
<s> Um-hum!
<s> I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
<s> Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
<s> What is it?
<s> No--no.
<s> Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
<s> You remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out <u>with</u> the Bank of Constantinople?
<s> Last year? It can't be that long.
<s> Sweetheart, what day is today?
<s> Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
<s> Yes.
<s> I know that niche.
<s> Not particularly.
<s> I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
<s> But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
<s> Too much blue in crimson.
<s> Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
<s> No. What is it? Tell me.
<s> Right!
<s> That sounds sensible. 
<s> Correct!  Good night.
<s> On the night table.
<s> Please! 
<s> What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
<s> And you expect me to believe that?
<s> I don't believe it!
<s> Divine ...
<s> No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
<s> For all the really important things--
<s> Very well, madame. Thank you. 
<s> Ever had a romance with a crook?
<s> Yes, my bag!
<s> I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
<s> Don't you mean work me?
<s> Rose Calvert.
<s> She knows.
<s> Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
<s> The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
<s> Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
<s> I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
<s> You're crazy.
<s> Could I speak to you in private?
<s> Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
<s> Jack.
<s> You're welcome. Rose.
<s> Just some sketches.
<s> No, no! Just with her hands.
<s> You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.
<s> Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
<s> I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
<s> He does landscapes.
<s> I'm so cold.
<s> Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
<s> If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
<s> It was a dreadful, heavy thing.  I only wore it this once.
<s> Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
<s> Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.
<s> Do you want the truth, Anya?
<s> No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
<s> That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
<s> Sure!  Excuse me.
<s> I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
<s> I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
<s> So you washed it off!
<s> Good-by.
<s> You work too fast for me, young man.
<s> Never eat before the show.
<s> You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
<s> Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
<s> You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
<s> But--
<s> Sally--!
<s> Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
<s> I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
<s> I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
<s> A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
<s> Jimmy!
<s> I thought you were a smart guy.
<s> Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
<s> Shortie, look!
<s> I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
<s> --there's thousands of 'em!
<s> Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
<s> No, sir?
<s> Are you screwy?
<s> Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
<s> Where did you hide it?
<s> Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
<s> Sure, I'll go.
<s> Coming to the pool for a swim?
<s> You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
<s> How?
<s> In New York.
<s> Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
<s> June? That's my wife's name.
<s> Sure.
<s> That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
<s> Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
<s> Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
<s> I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
<s> Meaning what?
<s> All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
<s> All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
<s> No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
<s> Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
<s> Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
<s> Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
<s> Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
<s> Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
<s> For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
<s> What's the matter?
<s> What!--are you crazy?
<s> 500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
<s> Now Ed, are we cross?
<s> Gave all that up.  Going into business.
<s> Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
<s> Where do you think?  I stole him.
<s> Come and get him.
<s> He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
<s> They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
<s> I know.  Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.
<s> In pace requiescat.
<s> All right, lunger.  Have at it.
<s> Say when.
<s> Nothing.  Not a thing.  I'm right As the mail.
<s> Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
<s> And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
<s> I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.
<s> But Doc-
<s> A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
<s> Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
<s> What?
<s> What?  But I saw 'em-
<s> Good God, you're really-
<s> Colorado's closer
<s> I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too.
<s> Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
<s> Easy now... That mare's in season.
<s> I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
<s> Getting late.  We better get back.
<s> Wyatt...
<s> I forgave you the moment you said it.
<s> Did you ever see the sun come up Over the Rockies?  It hits all of A sudden and below there's California and you swear you're Looking at heaven.
<s> Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
<s> I think I'll just lie down awhile
<s> You wanted to talk?
<s> Drop his horse.
<s> Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know.
<s> Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious!
<s> Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
<s> Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
<s> But she doted on the frowner
<s> Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
<s> I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
<s> Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
<s> Sir Elliot.
<s> I see.
<s> Sightseeing.
<s> Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
<s> Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
<s> Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.
<s> That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
<s> One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
<s> Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
<s> Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
<s> Fishing?
<s> Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
<s> I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
<s> I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
<s> Let's not make it a habit.
<s> You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
<s> Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
<s> He was my father's best friend!
<s> ... We have time for that?
<s> If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
<s> Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
<s> Good luck on your mission, 007.
<s> I am. What do you want?
<s> Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
<s> Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
<s> Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
<s> You have to leave -
<s> I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late.
<s> Since when?
<s> Junior spends time with his child.
<s> Soon as I rest a bit.  I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.
<s> Why in the h...
<s> I'm okay. Go back to your friends.
<s> And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
<s> Go back to sleep.
<s> You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
<s> Hush.
<s> No, I'm too hot now.
<s> What happened to your hand?
<s> It's healing now.
<s> He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.
<s> I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me.
<s> Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
<s> 'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead.
<s> Well, I don't want to put you out.
<s> She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
<s> You must have done something to her.
<s> What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
<s> Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
<s> Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
<s> Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
<s> You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
<s> He is in his pigeon cage.
<s> You know the man next door is near death.
<s> I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
<s> Whadda ya think?
<s> Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
<s> Where was the last place you left him?
<s> Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
<s> Mm-hmmmmm.
<s> HO-YAAAHH!!!
<s> Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
<s> Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
<s> Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
<s> I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
<s> This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
<s> Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
<s> What's with him?
<s> Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.
<s> Have you been replaced?
<s> Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm curious.  What does a Space Ranger actually do?
<s> Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
<s> I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
<s> That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
<s> Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
<s> This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
<s> Last present!
<s> Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
<s> You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.
<s> I did like the music.
<s> She got away.
<s> It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
<s> I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
<s> Home is where the heart is.
<s> Storms?
<s> Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
<s> Arnie, thank God.
<s> Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
<s> Please.  Tell me who Carl sells to.
<s> That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
<s> Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
<s> Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
<s> Me, too.
<s> Hi.
<s> We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
<s> What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
<s> How long's the job?
<s> Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
<s> Like I give a fuck.
<s> You can't make me.
<s> I get A's.  All A's.
<s> I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.
<s> Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
<s> So does half of San Diego.
<s> You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.
<s> So you pay off our customs officials?
<s> That thought makes me feel awful.
<s> So go shower already.
<s> Yes, sir!
<s> You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
<s> Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?
<s> Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
<s> No.
<s> Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
<s> What do you look for?
<s> Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.
<s> Like you protected Landry?
<s> I'm sorry... Did I wake you?
<s> Agents who died in the field.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> No. On you go.
<s> If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
<s> You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
<s> Diane.
<s> Eh-
<s> No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
<s> Are you clean?
<s> Is that a promise, then?
<s> Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
<s> Too young for what?
<s> Sixteen next month.
<s> It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
<s> I'd really rather take care of it myself.
<s> No.
<s> My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
<s> Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
<s> One hundred and sixteen minutes.
<s> Lewis Gilbert.
<s> Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
<s> We're two thousand short.
<s> Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
<s> Are you serious?
<s> Your favourite dish.
<s> I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.
<s> I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.
<s> No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
<s> Then I shall make use of this starship.
<s> Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
<s> Is there a problem, gentlemen?
<s> Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
<s> Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
<s> Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
<s> That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?
<s> Are we leaving, Captain?
<s> I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Fascinating.
<s> We don't have 1.2 hours.
<s> Captain, what have I done -
<s> This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
<s> The ship needs its Captain.
<s> No conditions.
<s> Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...
<s> "Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
<s> He's not?
<s> Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition.  Or yours.
<s> Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
<s> No. You must kill me.
<s> Do you?
<s> This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
<s> I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
<s> Hi, Flynn.
<s> I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
<s> You call that getting over it?
<s> Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow.
<s> oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
<s> No...
<s> It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
<s> Why? What are you going to do?
<s> Shhhhh.
<s> Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
<s> How 'bout yourself?
<s> Recognizers!
<s> We have to talk.
<s> Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
<s> They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
<s> Do it!
<s> As long as it gets us out of here
<s> So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
<s> Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
<s> It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine.
<s> Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got.
<s> What?
<s> Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--
<s> Goddammit!  That's outrageous.
<s> Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
<s> Put a tap on her phone.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> The purse is still at the house.
<s> You tell on me, I tell on you.
<s> What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
<s> Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.
<s> I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed.
<s> In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
<s> ... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
<s> I'd like that.
<s> Oral hygiene?
<s> There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
<s> What'd you do, honey?
<s> They must've just missed me.
<s> You will be contacted with the assignment.
<s> I'm not wearing any.
<s> Don't call me honey!  You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?!  You pig!
<s> My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
<s> I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
<s> Dance?
<s> Absolutely.
<s> So what's your angle?
<s> Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
<s> He said he was an American agent.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
<s> We're going to Paris?
<s> Hello, Alabama.
<s> What letter?
<s> You can't have just one.
<s> Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face.
<s> Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
<s> Get it.
<s> Now hang up.
<s> Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
<s> Is that your real name? Really?
<s> There's nothing to tell.
<s> What do you want to know?
<s> What do you do?
<s> Almost four years.
<s> I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.
<s> You didn't do nothing.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
<s> Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
<s> No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
<s> It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.
<s> You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it.
<s> Take that shit somewhere else.
<s> Can you live with it?
<s> Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
<s> Good for you.
<s> Every word of it.
<s> Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
<s> The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
<s> What's to think about?
<s> Sure. I didn't hear anything.
<s> Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
<s> No problems on both counts.
<s> They'll be along.
<s> I guess so. Follow me.
<s> Yeah?
<s> No. No you're not.
<s> You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
<s> I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.
<s> I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
<s> Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
<s> Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.
<s> Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
<s> You don't know the chicken places around where you live?  Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
<s> I'm your son.
<s> Do tell. Why drug related?
<s> I got some money I can give you -
<s> Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
<s> That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
<s> Sure.
<s> I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
<s> No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
<s> Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.
<s> Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
<s> What can I do?
<s> I'm not wearing a bra.
<s> Read my lips.
<s> For a man in your position...an opportunity.
<s> Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
<s> What's she doing?
<s> Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
<s> They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
<s> No more drugs.  Please...
<s> What?
<s> And I was in it?  What did I do?
<s> Clues?  What kind of clues?
<s> What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
<s> When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
<s> I've got one now.
<s> You have to give yourself up, you know.
<s> Give me the gun.
<s> I...I...We need cash, James.
<s> You... you left them a message?
<s> I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
<s> I need to make a telephone call.
<s> I'm not crazy.
<s> Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
<s> Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
<s> And what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith.
<s> You really want to know?
<s> That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist?  And now she's spray- painting our building?
<s> Then how come she knows what's going on?
<s> Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
<s> Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
<s> Think you'll live that long?
<s> Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself; is it worth it?
<s> Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today.
<s> Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
<s> Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
<s> You believe that?
<s> What?
<s> There you go, sweet talking me again.
<s> Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
<s> Yeah, I'll try.
<s> Who the hell is this!?
<s> I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
<s> They look nice.
<s> You didn't hear something?
<s> What does it look like?
<s> 'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.
<s> You're welcome, Grace.
<s> Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
<s> Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
<s> You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
<s> Whatever it takes.
<s> Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
<s> How much money has he got?
<s> Kill someone.  I can't do it.
<s> Wait.  What about . . . him?
<s> I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
<s> It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
<s> Accident.
<s> Like you don't know.
<s> I was hoping we could talk.
<s> You're talking like a mad man.
<s> That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
<s> For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
<s> And tell her what?
<s> You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right?  What's the matter?  You were hoping to get it on home video?  A keepsake for the grandkids.  Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.
<s> I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?
<s> I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
<s> Came close this time and it scares you.
<s> Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
<s> Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
<s> Wh . . . what are you talking about?
<s> Christ, Jake, please--
<s> It's not me you have to worry about. It's her.  She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.
<s> Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
<s> How old are you?
<s> Yes, Mr. Vesci.
<s> Hello?  Hello!?  Operator, I got disconnected.  Hello . . .
<s> Jesus!
<s> Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
<s> Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
<s> There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
<s> Thirty-thousand dollars.
<s> But, Senor--
<s> See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
<s> ...And everything is nothing too.
<s> So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
<s> So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
<s> No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
<s> You know I won't be seeing you.
<s> That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
<s> Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
<s> Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
<s> Oh, shit!
<s> Accident.
<s> Bobby Cooper.
<s> It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
<s> Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
<s> I did?
<s> Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
<s> You love her, but you hate her?
<s> I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
<s> What are you talking about!
<s> Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon...
<s> I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
<s> I've had time to get over it.
<s> How old are you?
<s> Get away from me!
<s> He's up at the Look Out.
<s> Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
<s> Yep.
<s> Don't look like nothing.
<s> Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
<s> How much!?
<s> About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
<s> Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.
<s> What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
<s> What?
<s> I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
<s> Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
<s> I want my car.
<s> That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
<s> It's Grace.
<s> You sure you can manage?
<s> You're welcome, Grace.
<s> Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
<s> Like you.
<s> How do you know he's still not here?
<s> Walk away.
<s> Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
<s> I'm sorry...
<s> At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
<s> Because I know you're full of shit.
<s> After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
<s> I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
<s> But we all need that too. Hold him.
<s> Bobby? Are you all right?
<s> Harlin's.
<s> Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
<s> Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
<s> Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
<s> Which you don't have.
<s> ...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
<s> Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
<s> What was that all about?
<s> ...But I bet the story she <u>didn't</u> tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake <u>was really her Papa</u>. And she <u>liked</u> fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you!
<s> Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
<s> No! No! Please!
<s> You didn't hear something?
<s> You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
<s> Is Noel in?
<s> Four.
<s> What did I say?
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
<s> My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
<s> I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
<s> He's dealing with a lot of things.  I think he needs to find answers himself.
<s> Seventy-five percent.
<s> But not a knife?
<s> No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me.  Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do.
<s> I lied.
<s> Okay.
<s> Against a window.
<s> No.
<s> How long have you been married?
<s> Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
<s> Where is it?
<s> What wife? He don't have no wife.
<s> I told you, he don't have no wife, not aboveground, anyhow.
<s> Nope.
<s> Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
<s> You want... a free one.
<s> Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?
<s> Alive?
<s> ...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
<s> You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
<s> "Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
<s> A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?
<s> D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.
<s> Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.
<s> Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
<s> Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
<s> They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
<s> A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
<s> I could of... easy.
<s> I don't never see nobody anyhow.
<s> You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
<s> You still think he's in there?
<s> Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm...  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
<s> Nor Quincy, I guess.
<s> You ain't like that no more.
<s> Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
<s> Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
<s> Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
<s> He's blind, for Chri...
<s> I don't like the question.
<s> How many you killed, Kid?
<s> He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
<s> You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
<s> No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
<s> I hope I didn't disturb you.
<s> Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
<s> You are a criminal.
<s> Can we stealth these guys?
<s> Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
<s> Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
<s> Did you hear what he just said?
<s> Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
<s> Tough break.
<s> Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
<s> You okay?
<s> What time is it?
<s> Who is he?
<s> Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
<s> Waste of time.
<s> This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
<s> That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
<s> Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
<s> I'm not a rat.
<s> Is he the one that killed Keaton?
<s> Kobayashi.
<s> Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE.
<s> This is totally irrelevant.
<s> Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
<s> Then why didn't you help him?
<s> I don't
<s> Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
<s> Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
<s> Yes.
<s> All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
<s> How did you settle on the amount?
<s> Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
<s> Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...
<s> What does it mean?
<s> ...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
<s> I know of him.
<s> Meth...Methodology and Technique...
<s> Nothing further, your Honor.
<s> Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
<s> ... that's all right.
<s> I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
<s> I completely understand ...
<s> Why is that?
<s> That's what I'd planned to...
<s> ...I made a reservation at...
<s> No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
<s> Right.  Who called?
<s> You're going to settle out of court?
<s> Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?
<s> I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
<s> ...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
<s> Nothing happened.
<s> And ask me what?
<s> This is a complicated case, your Honor...
<s> I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
<s> If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
<s> If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
<s> From the magazine?
<s> My subscription lapsed three years ago...
<s> And are they going to get it?
<s> Maybe what?
<s> We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
<s> You're talking like a drunk.
<s> I...
<s> ...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
<s> Right.
<s> You got a good memory, Franky.
<s> I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
<s> Gimme the address.  I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
<s> I'm swell.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I think we tried that.  The case is over.
<s> ...one of the other nurses?
<s> Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
<s> It's locked.
<s> ... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
<s> ... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.  He's only trying to do what's right.
<s> You saw Kat in New York...   ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
<s> That's a wonderful profession.  My daughter-in-law's a nurse.  What did you do, stop?
<s> Yes.
<s> We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
<s> How'm I doing so far?
<s> Should I?
<s> Yes.
<s> The Big Boy did...?
<s> No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
<s> No, I'm all right.
<s> No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
<s> From whom?
<s> We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
<s> All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
<s> There are things you didn't tell me.
<s> But you knew about this.
<s> Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
<s> Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
<s> What happened?
<s> Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
<s> You won't have to.
<s> No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
<s> No, you don't owe me anything.
<s> Because I remind you of her?
<s> I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
<s> No.
<s> No, it's not right.
<s> Ah, no!
<s> Is that the best you can do?
<s> Oh, no. You'll muss me.
<s> No, Ernie's is fine.
<s> So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.
<s> You...  ...fell into the Bay.
<s> I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
<s> John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
<s> You've nothing to apologize for.
<s> Well... anywhere in particular?
<s> Only silence. It's always like this.
<s> Long ago...
<s> A grave...
<s> Only this far.
<s> At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
<s> I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up...
<s> You can't.
<s> Yes.
<s> No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
<s> To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
<s> That's following a train of thought.
<s> That's Skid Row... isn't it?
<s> I'll take you home.
<s> Mmm, yeah, I guess...
<s> Where?
<s> Oh... this and that.
<s> What is it, a still life?
<s> Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
<s> But you said grey, sir.
<s> Don't touch her. Call 911.
<s> What did you say?
<s> Playing?
<s> It's sacrilegious.
<s> You're pathetic.
<s> You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
<s> I'm not getting a ticket.
<s> You want to hear me out?
<s> Why?
<s> That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
<s> Have you ever done this before?
<s> What?
<s> Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
<s> We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
<s> No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
<s> Later.
<s> No. I think it's fucked.
<s> I know...
<s> Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
<s> There's more.
<s> Great. Fine. Perfect.
<s> Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
<s> Here's his head.
<s> I'm not talking to you?
<s> That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
<s> Shut up Boyd.
<s> He is not cracking up.
<s> What did you ask me?
<s> Exactly! Exactly my point.
<s> Hear what?
<s> Now?
<s> You're sick.
<s> What's your point?
<s> They need leadership.
<s> You said nobody would miss her.
<s> I love you.
<s> What?
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> How could I know what else I forgot?
<s> You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
<s> It's vile!
<s> Problems?
<s> Hi.
<s> I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
<s> What!
<s> "At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
<s> I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
<s> The prostitute.
<s> She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
<s> What does that mean?
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Buzzing?
<s> The stone age.
<s> Take your time. I wish I had.
<s> So where to on the honeymoon?
<s> Yes, yes.
<s> Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
<s> A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
<s> No. Mother Superior told me to come.
<s> What's the matter?
<s> She won't even know.
<s> Fifteen yards.
<s> No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving?
<s> Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
<s> That your cousin is more to your taste.
<s> These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
<s> Are you Jorge?
<s> Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
<s> No.
<s> Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
<s> He couldn't get through the door, then?
<s> I'm only good at making people laugh.
<s> Ah! Pleased to meet you.
<s> Me? What did I do?
<s> But only you will know he's not human.
<s> If you can catch him.
<s> Where's my gun?
<s> On my life, I promise you I will.
<s> I don't set policy.  You have the key?
<s> Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
<s> Only because I got pulled out early.
<s> Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
<s> Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
<s> It's nanotechnology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
<s> Turn it down!

<s> Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.
<s> How much?
<s> I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...
<s> Yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon: rule one, capital reserves. This company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. That buys us a lot of credibility...  ...and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker...
<s> I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
<s> Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.

<s> Give me that shit.  Your wife.
<s> Um...yes.
<s> And then you weren't there.
<s> What?
<s> I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
<s> I should be going anyway.
<s> This is...
<s> She's making this up.
<s> Good.  I'm good.

<s> Why?
<s> We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
<s> I think three...

<s> Mmnph.
<s> In the house.  I was scared.
<s> I'm so sorry.
<s> What?  No.  No.
<s> Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
<s> What?
<s> Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
<s> I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
<s> What can it hurt to talk to someone?
<s> Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
<s> Are you glad?  I'm glad.
<s> Stop...
<s> Who?
<s> Claire--
<s> So you fucked a student?!
<s> And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
<s> She's gone.
<s> I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
<s> You don't have to do that.
<s> :No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
<s> :Well, they are.
<s> :Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
<s> You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
<s> But you've not told Michael.
<s> But why would they do that...?
<s> Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.
<s> I want to see my mother.
<s> He made that quite clear, yes.
<s> Hello...?  Who is this...?
<s> I under5tand.  All the same
<s> I'm tired.  I need to rest.
<s> 'He'...?
<s> ENOUGH!!!
<s> You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
<s> I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
<s> Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
<s> FAST.
<s> Like this...?
<s> Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
<s> Go away!  I don't want you here.
<s> I LOVE him!
<s> No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
<s> But have I...?  Ever...?!
<s> I love Michael...
<s> They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
<s> No!   Don't!  Lasher!!!
<s> Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
<s> The one time I want it to work...
<s> Captain's orders.
<s> Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...
<s> I know.  It's not possible --- but I know.
<s> He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
<s> It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?
<s> He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
<s> If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
<s> Mm-hmm...
<s> Talking to me dear...?
<s> It's not true.  You have to believe me.
<s> It's alright...it's airight.  He's gone, Michael...  Gone.
<s> If you like that type.
<s> Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
<s> Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
<s> Is that a crack about our singing...?
<s> As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
<s> I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
<s> Yes, one and a half please.
<s> My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
<s> Why should I?
<s> STEPHANIE?
<s> Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
<s> It was wrong - all my life I have been cheated - cheated of anything good - I shouldn't have been born - I was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me...
<s> No thanks - 
<s> There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
<s> Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
<s> I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
<s> No worries
<s> I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
<s> Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
<s> Perv.
<s> Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
<s> I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
<s> We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
<s> Let me get this straight...
<s> You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
<s> You have changed since second grade.
<s> You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
<s> We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
<s> But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
<s> Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
<s> I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
<s> I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
<s> Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
<s> I will not have my boys arguing.
<s> Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
<s> We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
<s> I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary.
<s> We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.
<s> Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!
<s> Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
<s> You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
<s> The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning expos changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.
<s> Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
<s> You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
<s> You've got enough people kissing your ass.
<s> Your dad taught you everything.
<s> It's incredibly simple.
<s> I know.
<s> In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
<s> Well? Where the hell are you?
<s> I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
<s> You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
<s> You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
<s> Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
<s> I'll make you very proud.
<s> But how would we pay our bills?
<s> Forget the store. Think big.
<s> We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
<s> Seldom? No kidding?
<s> I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
<s> Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
<s> Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
<s> I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
<s> He was in a league of his own.
<s> I can't wait to see the pictures.
<s> I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
<s> All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
<s> I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
<s> It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.
<s> I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
<s> I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
<s> And where might that be?
<s> The teeth doin' any talkin'?
<s> I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
<s> Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
<s> There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
<s> Suzie Toller is missing.
<s> Ray thinks she was murdered.
<s> All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
<s> Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
<s> I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
<s> Ray, you heard him...
<s> Where's this coming from?
<s> I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
<s> You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
<s> Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
<s> Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be.
<s> Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
<s> What brain?
<s> Police -- God -- get a life.
<s> Yes.  God, Mom...
<s> Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
<s> Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
<s> Duquette.  Forget him...
<s> Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
<s> Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
<s> Hi, Sandy.
<s> I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
<s> Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
<s> Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
<s> You need that real often?
<s> No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
<s> And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
<s> It's a repeating steam cannon!
<s> Hey, I tried the board.
<s> What way is that?
<s> I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
<s> It's better than nothing.
<s> It's not a guy...
<s> Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
<s> What is this?  A whole new train?
<s> I'm sure we will.
<s> I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
<s> You tell me.
<s> You bring the best out in a man.
<s> Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
<s> How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
<s> For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
<s> He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
<s> Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
<s> They're not after me.  They want the baby.
<s> Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
<s> What is Tir Asleen?
<s> My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
<s> Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
<s> Not today, Willow.
<s> If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
<s> He's no magician.
<s> Why.
<s> I will.
<s> Where the hell did you come from?
<s> Well what did she say?
<s> You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
<s> Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?
<s> No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
<s> What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep...
<s> What do I need for that?
<s> The limitless power of...
<s> Why?
<s> Who is that horrible friend of yours?
<s> Who??
<s> Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
<s> Maybe milking.
<s> Cows. You know, cows?
<s> Sorry. It's important.
<s> Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
<s> They're Amish.
<s> John, I don't understand any of this.
<s> Okay, Mr. Book.
<s> You don't say.
<s> Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
<s> Oh, he's good.
<s> Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight  street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
<s> He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
<s> You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
<s> No, no doctor...
<s> Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
<s> Aren't you? After today?
<s> I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
<s> Wrong.
<s> I admit I don't know where he is.
<s> Not yet.
<s> Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
<s> Yes.
<s> You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
<s> We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
<s> John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
<s> I don't think she knows.
<s> Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
<s> They are English. They don't understand.
<s> Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
<s> Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
<s> Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
<s> Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
<s> Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
<s> Oh ....
<s> Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
<s> Hickory!
<s> I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
<s> Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
<s> Why --

<s> Oh -- yes.

<s> Your father...
<s> How would you know?
<s> You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
<s> Jon, no -- I can't --
<s> You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
<s> Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
<s> His . . . whatever.
<s> Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
<s> I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
<s> Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
<s> Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
<s> Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?

<s> There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
<s> Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
<s> My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
<s> Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
<s> Yes it does.
<s> Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
<s> Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life.
<s> We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
<s> I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
<s> Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
<s> We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
<s> What weapons do you have?
<s> What do you get if you finish?
<s> I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.
<s> Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.

<s> Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
<s> So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?

<s> When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
<s> Let me.
<s> A piece of shrapnel hit me.
<s> Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
<s> I thought that was in detail.
<s> Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
<s> I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
<s> Here we go again.
<s> Why you dogging me up?
<s> It's like you said, every man for himself.
<s> This pizda? Never seen him before.

<s> I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
<s> So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
<s> You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
<s> What's that?
<s> Not interested.
<s> Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
<s> I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
<s> What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.

<s> I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
<s> Not fooling around.
<s> No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
<s> You've got to help me to remain faithful.
<s> There must have been someone else down here then.
<s> Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.
