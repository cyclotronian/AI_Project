<chandler> do you know which one you &apos;re gonna be ?  
<chandler> good luck ,  man .  i hope you get it .  
<chandler> yes ,  every single one of them .  
<chandler> i thought it was $98 . 50 .  
<chandler> i &apos;d just like to say that i &apos;m totally behind this experiment .  in fact ,  i &apos;d very much like to butter your head .   
<chandler> all right ,  i &apos;m nine years old .  
<chandler> we just finished this magnificent thanksgiving dinner .  i have -  - and i remember this part vividly -  - a mouthful of pumpkin pie ,  and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they &apos;re getting divorced .  
<chandler> yes .  it &apos;s very difficult to appreciate a thanksgiving dinner once you &apos;ve seen it in reverse .  
<chandler> tonight ,  on a very special blossom .  commercial break 
<chandler> oh ,  you must stop shooping .  
<chandler> no ,  i prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment .   
<chandler> ok ,  we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing ,  but that &apos;s not funny anymore .   
<chandler> the most unbelievable thing has happened .  underdog has just gotten away .  
<chandler> no ,  no ,  the actual cartoon character .  of course the balloon .  it &apos;s all over the news .  right before he reached macy &apos;s ,  he broke free and was spotted flying over washington square park .  i &apos;m goin &apos; to the roof ,  who &apos;s with me ?  
<chandler> come on .  an 80 - foot inflatable dog let loose over the city .  how often does that happen ?  
<chandler> do either of you have the keys ?  
<chandler>  for an emergency just like this .  
<chandler> ok ,  monica ,  only dogs can hear you now ,  so ,  look ,  the door &apos;s open .  here we go .   
<chandler> now this feels like thanksgiving .  
<chandler> shall i carve ?  
<chandler> ok ,  who wants light cheese ,  and who wants dark cheese ?  
<chandler> i &apos;d like to propose a toast .  little toast here ,  ding ding .  i know this isn &apos;t the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned ,  but for me ,  this has been really great ,  you know ,  i think because it didn &apos;t involve divorce or projectile vomiting .  anyway ,  i was just thinking ,  i mean ,  if you &apos;d gone to vail ,  and if you guys &apos;d been with your family ,  if you didn &apos;t have syphilis and stuff ,  we wouldn &apos;t be all together ,  you know ?  so i guess what i &apos;m trying to say is that i &apos;m very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked .

<chandler> if that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off !

<chandler> hey pheebs !  
<chandler> if you wanna give joey a christmas present that disrupts the entire building ,  why not get him something a little bit more subtle ,  like a wrecking ball ,  or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway ?  
<chandler>  ho ,  ho ,  ho !  merry christmas !  
<chandler> hey !   
<chandler> well ,  i &apos;m here to see my old buddy ben .  what are you doing here ,  weird turtle - man ?

<chandler> you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a santa costume ,  so i borrowed one from a guy at work !

<chandler> fine ,  i &apos;ll give the suit back .   
<chandler> santa ?  really ?  
<chandler> did your dad ever dress up like santa ?

<chandler>  it was at the front door .  when i got home .  somebody sent it to us .  
<chandler> ino !  i didn &apos;t read the box before i opened it .  and you can &apos;t return a box after you &apos;ve opened the box .  
<chandler> because it &apos;s too delicious .  
<chandler> no - no - no !  it is going to be okay ,  because mrs .  braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win !  the only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate ,   mommas little bakery .   i feel terrible ,  im a horrible ,  horrible ,  horrible person .  
<chandler> so

<chandler> well ive forgotten what it tastes like okay ?  !

<chandler> so apparently we just dont pay for food anymore .   do you see what i see ?  
<chandler> mrs .  braverman must be out .   
<chandler> by then ,  the cheesecake may have gone bad .  we dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake .

<chandler> but we should take it .  
<chandler> why ?

<chandler> mmm that &apos;s enough about you !  
<chandler> no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no !  no ,  no .  .  .  we &apos;re not together .  we &apos;re not a couple .  we &apos;re definately not a couple .  
<chandler> we &apos;re not gonna have this conversation again .  .  .  look at this place .  why am i so intimidated by this guy ?  pretentious art ,  this huge macho couch .  when we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing monica to a real man !   you don &apos;t think he &apos;s here ,  do you ?   
<chandler>  look at these videos .  you know ,  i mean ,  who does he think he is ?  magnum force ,  dirty harry ,  cool hand luke .  .  .  oh my god !  
<chandler> there &apos;s a tape here with monica &apos;s name on it .  
<chandler> get there faster !   
<chandler> don &apos;t judge me ,  i &apos;m only human !  
<chandler> i had to !  okay ,  imagine you were married .  .  .  and you found a tape of your wife in another guys &apos; apartment .  .  .  wouldn &apos;t you need to know what was on it ?  
<chandler> some girl .  .  .  !  ?  
<chandler> yeah .  .  .  !  ?  
<chandler> allright ,  i &apos;m gonna watch it .  .  .  i mean look ,  it &apos;s probably not even what i think it is .  .  .  and even if it is .  .  .  it can &apos;t possibly be as bad as what i &apos;m picturing in my head .  .  .   can it ?  
<chandler> then you &apos;re gonna have to watch it for me .  
<chandler> just for a few seconds ,  so i can know what it is .  .  .  please ?  
<chandler> why am i hearing cheering ?  
<chandler> football ?  just football ?  
<chandler> it &apos;s football .  .  .  it &apos;s just football .  .  .  this is great !  this is the first time i &apos;ve ever enjoyed football .  .  .  it may be customary to get a beer .  .  .   what the .  .  .   what are you doing ?  
<chandler> whoho ho .  .  .  listen to the judgement from the porn star !  
<chandler> because that &apos;s who i am ,  okay ?  i &apos;m sure a mature man like richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn &apos;t bother him .  just &apos;d be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men &apos;s club over brandy and moustaches .  
<chandler> this is about you and richard .  he &apos;s clearly not over you .  he keeps a tape so he can .  .  .  look at it whenever he wants .  
<chandler> oh ,  yeah ,  well ,  poor richard .  y &apos; .  .  .  i can grow a moustache !  
<chandler> yeah ,  oh ,  but i just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air .  .  .  
<chandler> oh ,  good ,  good .  play more ,   &apos;cause i wanna see how it ends .  
<chandler> what .  .  .  ?  that &apos;s not you !  life is good again !  ride  &apos;em cowgirl !  
<chandler> is that a problem ?  
<chandler> yeah .  hey !  here &apos;s an idea .  why don &apos;t we use our wedding china today ?  
<chandler> honey ,  she keeps cancelling on us .  .  . take the hint !  
<chandler> what is the point of having them ,  if we never use them ?  
<chandler> i will explain it to her .  
<chandler> muskogee ?  that &apos;s like four hours from tulsa !  woo hoo !  soap ,  days of our lives .   
<chandler> aren &apos;t you one of the stars of popular daytime soap days of our lives ?  
<chandler> what are you going to do ?  
<chandler> well ,  you proved them wrong .  
<chandler> i &apos;ll tell you what .  for the rest of our lives ,  i &apos;ll be careful ,  until told otherwise .   
<chandler> wait a minute .  this isn &apos;t the china we picked out .  .  .  
<chandler> why ?  
<chandler> oh suddenly flowers are feminine ?  
<chandler> i can &apos;t believe you want us to raise emma !  
<chandler> you know guys ,  i gotta say this ,  this means so much to me .  that you &apos;d trust me ,  with your child .  .  . i mean ,  we all know that monica and i have been trying to have a baby of our own ,  and i &apos;ve had my doubts about my skills as a father ,  but .  .  . that you two .  .  .  . that you two .  .  .  
<chandler> no .  .  . if crazy plate lady .  .  .  if monica dies .  .  . then .  .  . i would get emma .  .  . right ?  
<chandler> actually what ?  
<chandler> what ?  ?  !  
<chandler> so ,  if monica &apos;s not around ,  i &apos;m not good enough to raise emma ?  
<chandler> what .  .  . what is wrong with me ?  am i ,  am i incompetent ?  because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you !  
<chandler> look ,  i may not know alot about babies ,  but you really think i &apos;m not capable ?  
<chandler> ok ,  so if we both had emma ,  and i die  she &apos;d have to give her up .  
<chandler> so .  .  . so let me get this straight .  so my two friends die ,  i get emma ,  then my wife dies ,  then emma the one - tiny - ray - of - hope left in my life ,  gets taken away from me ?  
<chandler> oh ,  did somebody miss me ?  is there a child to raise poorly ?  
<chandler> y &apos;know but they &apos;re right .  i &apos;m not a strong father - figure and i never will be .  
<chandler> yeah ,  but it &apos;s not who i am .  everything they said is exactly why i was worried about having a kid .  and it &apos;s true !  and ,  look ,  everybody knows it .  
<chandler> oh yeah ,  well ,  can you picture me saying ,   &quot; go to your room !  you &apos;re grounded !  &quot;  
<chandler> you said that to me last week .  
<chandler> no ,  no that &apos;s ok .  you &apos;re totally right i don &apos;t know anything about disciplining a child .  but .  .  . you did hurt my feelings .  .  . so ,  i want you to know that if i die ,  you don &apos;t get joey .    
<chandler> alright !  that is it !  this is our apartment and you cannot behave this way .  now if you can &apos;t act your age ,  then you shouldn &apos;t be here at all .  now ,  those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones i picked out .  .  . but they &apos;re very important to monica .  .  . and i want you to apologize to her right now .  
<chandler> ok .  .  . that &apos;s better .  now i want you to apologize to each other ,  and mean it .  
<chandler> oh yeah ?  well ,  thanks !  
<chandler> ok .  .  . but you should know ,  he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose .   
<chandler> oh no no !  i &apos;ll get her .  i &apos;m super - confident ,  totally responsible and fourth in line to raise emma .  /  i &apos;ll be right there emma !  just let me get my trusty diaper bag here .   
<chandler> well ,  what do you know ?  i guess ,  i &apos;ll be the one who dies first .    
<chandler> nope .  
<chandler> yup .  
<chandler> nope .   
<chandler> hey !  so ,  i &apos;m gonna put the plates back .  y &apos;know i think you &apos;re right .  .  . i don &apos;t think we should use these plates again for a long time .  
<chandler> maybe not even then !   
<chandler> yeah .  thats a lot of cats ,  jolene .  single ,  are ya ?   
<chandler> chandler bing .

<chandler> merry christmas .  
<chandler> merry christmas ,  you guys !  
<chandler> ah well ,  she &apos;s got this weird idea ,  that ,  uh ,  y &apos;know ,  just because you and i are alone ,  that something is gonna happen .

<chandler> i don &apos;t know; i &apos;m not used to girls making passes at me !   .  .  .   wait a minute .  .  .  am i sexy in oklahoma ?

<chandler> well look ,  it &apos;s not easy to spend this much time apart ,  you know .  right on money !   .  .  .  you know ,  she &apos;s amazing ,  and beautiful ,  and smart ,  and if she were here right now ,   .  .  . she &apos;d kick your ass .  look ,  you &apos;re a really nice person .  .  .  ham stealing and adultery aside .  but ,  what i have with my wife is pretty great ,  so nothing is ever gonna happen between us .  
<chandler> you kidding ?  you &apos;re the most beautiful woman in most rooms .  .  .   whoa !  whoa !  whoa !  what &apos;s going on ?  you and i just made out !  you and i are making out ?  
<chandler> but we don &apos;t do that .  
<chandler> how drunk are you ?  
<chandler>  that &apos;s the perfect amount !  
<chandler> what ?  
<chandler> i know .  
<chandler> well ,  i have kissed over four women .   do you wanna get under the covers ?  
<chandler> okay !   
<chandler> it bodes well for me that speed impresses you .  
<chandler> yep !  
<chandler> count of three ?  
<chandler> two !  
<chandler> well i think it &apos;s safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined .  
<chandler> eh !    
<chandler> y &apos;know ,  i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary .  .  .  well ,  i have ,  and the technical definition is ,  two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together .  but if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me ,  then we have to ,  y &apos;know ,  get you my original dictionary .  i am *so* bad at this .  
<chandler> really ?  okay ,  so .  .  .  
<chandler> y &apos;know ,  i sensed that i should stop .  so we &apos;re okay ?  
<chandler> right !   
<chandler> okay ,  all right ,  all right ,  all right !  okay !   okay ,  here &apos;s something ,  here &apos;s something blue and new .  
<chandler> let &apos;s go !   
<chandler> oh ,  okay ,  i have condom in my wallet that i &apos;ve had since i was twelve .  
<chandler> i don &apos;t think so .  
<chandler>  here just .  .  . take this .   
<chandler> no ,  we &apos;ll - we &apos;ll bring it back !  just put it under your dress .   
<chandler> okay ,  one thing at a time .    
<chandler> ehh .  
<chandler> look ,  i thought about it too ,  and i &apos;m sorry .  i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding .  
<chandler> yeah ,  i &apos;m putting my foot down .  yeah look ,  when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy ,  and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy ,  then ,  then that &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do .  
<chandler> eh ,  forget about the future and stuff !  so we only have two kids ,  y &apos;know ?  we &apos;ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college .  
<chandler> yeah .  
<chandler> uh ,  four ,  a boy ,  twin girls and another boy .  
<chandler> well ,  stuff like where we &apos;d live ,  y &apos;know ?  like a small place outside the city ,  where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff .  y &apos;know ,  we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door .  of course ,  we &apos;d have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old .  
<chandler> sure you do .  
<chandler> you sure ?  
<chandler> i love you so much .  
<chandler> hey !   
<chandler> i wanted to be with you .  i missed you so much .  
<chandler> monica .  
<chandler> i never want to leave you again !  
<chandler> turns out they can &apos;t fire me .  because i quit .  
<chandler> yeah !  it &apos;s a stupid job ,  and i could not stand leaving you .  and why should i be the only one who doesn &apos;t get to do what he *really* wants to do ?  
<chandler>  i have *not* thought this through !  
<chandler> i know ,  i ,  i should have talked to you first about it .  
<chandler> thanks !  
<chandler>  ahh .  .  .  
<chandler>  here ,  pass these ,  will ya .  .    
<chandler> i .  .  .  thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people .  besides ,  this gift still says i love you guys .  
<chandler> i don &apos;t have a *job* !   -  -  -  closing credits  -  -  -  
<chandler> i &apos;ve got nowhere to go this morning .  i &apos;m unemployed !  i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna do with my life .  
<chandler> i mean ,  what am i supposed to do with myself ?  
<chandler> but it &apos;s all so overwhelming .  i don &apos;t know where to start .  
<chandler> hey !  this is where your hyper - organized - pain - in - the - ass stuff pays off !  
<chandler> how long was i in there ?  
<chandler> wait .  advertising !  that &apos;s a great idea !  
<chandler> i don &apos;t think i have to hear the rest .  advertising makes perfect sense .  sorry you had to waste all this time ,  though .  
<chandler> i mean ,  i can write slogans .  i mean ,  how hard can it be ,  right ?   &quot; cheese .  it &apos;s milk that you chew .  &quot;   &quot; crackers .  because your cheese needs a buddy .  &quot;   &quot; a grape .  because who can get a water melon in your mouth ?  &quot;  
<chandler> honey ?  leave it to the pros .  
<chandler>  &quot; the phone .  bringing you closer to people .  .  . who have phones .  &quot;  
<chandler> no ,  no .  but let me show you what i can do .   &quot; bagels and donuts .  round food for every mood .  &quot;  
<chandler> really ?  that &apos;s great !  
<chandler> it &apos;s funny .  when you said  &quot; unpaid &quot;  it sounded like you said  &quot; unpaid .  &quot;  
<chandler> actually ,  we &apos;re trying ,  and i don &apos;t think monica &apos;s gonna wanna postpone it .  we &apos;re supposed to have sex tonight .  actually ,  she &apos;s probably at home naked right now .  i tend to keep talking until somebody stops me .  i can just picture her on the bed right now .  
<chandler> yeah .  
<chandler> yeah ,  ross is here so .  .  .  
<chandler> hey .  
<chandler> oh ,  yeah .  but you have to give it back if i get a job .  of course ,  by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we &apos;ll all be wearing silver jump suits .  
<chandler> oh god ,  i have to tell you something .  you &apos;re not pregnant .  
<chandler> that thing that i have to do to make a baby .  i faked it .  
<chandler> oh yes you can .  you just make the faces and the noises .  
<chandler> that &apos;s actually why .  look ,  i &apos;m starting a whole new career now ,  and i &apos;m not saying that i don &apos;t want to have a baby ,  i &apos;m just saying maybe we could wait a little while .  
<chandler> or a year ?  
<chandler> it could be less than a year .  i mean ,  you &apos;ve heard my stuff .   &quot; pants .  like shorts ,  but longer .  &quot;   it &apos;ll probably be more than a year .  
<chandler> yeah ,  me too .  look ,  i &apos;ll just get my old job back .  
<chandler> i quit and you learn what i do ?  
<chandler> i guess .  it &apos;s always gonna be scary when we have a baby .  
<chandler> should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind ?  
<chandler> oh ,  and i promise ,  i will not fake it this time .  
<chandler> oh ,  she &apos;s at home ,  putting up decorations for rachel &apos;s birthday party tonight .  
<chandler> i tried ,  but apparantly singing  &quot; i will survive &quot;  in a helium voice  -  not helping .   
<chandler> yes ,  bravo on the hot nanny .  
<chandler> are you kidding ?  if i wasn &apos;t married she &apos;d be rejecting me right now .  
<chandler> now that rachel &apos;s gone ?  
<chandler> i wasn &apos;t staring .  i was leering .  
<chandler> looks like joey is doing allright with her .  
<chandler> seriously dude ,  3 years ago .  
<chandler> you don &apos;t trust him ?  
<chandler> is this really your long term plan ,  for me to run interference ?  because i could get a job any day now .  
<chandler> allright ,  fine ,  but don &apos;t blame me if it doesn &apos;t work .  because you know as well as i do that once joey sets his mind on something ,  more often than not ,  he &apos;s going to have sex with it .  
<chandler> picturing that tree ?  
<chandler> oh .  you mind if i join you ?  
<chandler> your thoughts ?  plural ?  
<chandler> i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t let you do that ,  joe .  
<chandler> yes ,  as a matter of fact he did ,  so i can &apos;t let you go .  
<chandler> great novels ?  
<chandler>  i &apos;m sorry ,  i got a little occupied .  
<chandler>  right behind you ,  big guy !   
<chandler>  first i was afraid ,  i was petrified  
<chandler>  hi

<chandler> well ,  i can &apos;t say  &quot; hump &quot;  or  &quot; screw &quot;  in front of the b - a - b - y .  
<chandler> horrifying ?  scarring ?  something people go to jail for ?  
<chandler> you guess i &apos;m right ?  when we stayed at that bed and breakfast ,  you wouldn &apos;t have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window .  
<chandler> emma was doing it !  
<chandler> ooh ,  she &apos;s asleep ,  that means we can .  .  .  
<chandler> i think we may have really done it this time .  
<chandler> you may wanna get some more of those too .   
<chandler> where &apos;s emma ?  
<chandler> don &apos;t ask me ,  i was in there canoodling you !

<chandler> no ,  no ,  no .  
<chandler> what ?  why ?  
<chandler> your family name is tribbiani .  
<chandler> thank you .  i got a job in advertising .   
<chandler> actually ,  it pays nothing .  it &apos;s an internship .  
<chandler> right .  so ,  it &apos;ll be the same except less sex with you .   
<chandler> well ,  it &apos;s a training program ,  but at the end ,  they hire the people they like .  
<chandler> yeah ,  i mean ,  there &apos;s probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink ,  you know ,  grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating  
<chandler>  humiliating and noble !   
<chandler> oh ,  no ,  no ,  i &apos;m an intern ,  just like you guys except for the tie ,  the briefcase and the fact that i can rent a car .  
<chandler> yeah ,  well ,  i &apos;m kinda heading into a new career direction and ,  you know ,  you gotta start at the bottom .  
<chandler> right .  look ,  i know i &apos;m a little bit older than you guys ,  but it &apos;s not like i &apos;m bob hope   
<chandler> the comedian ?  uso ?  !  
<chandler>  honey ,  i &apos;m old !  
<chandler> i am so much older than these other interns .  i can &apos;t compete with them .  
<chandler> yes ,  but i don &apos;t think life experience with these .   
<chandler> they &apos;re these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which i can &apos;t do because no self - respecting adult would ever where these .  
<chandler> what am i supposed to do with these ?  
<chandler> well ,  first of all ,  they &apos;re not called  &quot; sneakers &quot;  anymore .  apparently ,  they &apos;re called  &quot; kicks &quot;  or  &quot; skids &quot;  and i think i heard somebody say  &quot; slorps &quot;  .   roll around  &apos;cause ,  apparently ,  walking is too much exercise .  kids ,  kids ,  roll your way to childhood obesity !   would you help me try to sell these ?  
<chandler> no ,  i don &apos;t think that &apos;s the kinda thing they &apos;re looking for .  
<chandler> hey !  
<chandler> putting on the sneakers thought i &apos;d get into a younger mindset ,  you know ,  to see if it sparked anything 
<chandler> yes ,  how &apos;s this kicked in the nuts for your feet !   
<chandler>  you know what these aren &apos;t half - bad !   you should suggest something like these to ralph lauren .  
<chandler> alright  i feel youger already !   
<chandler>  yah ,  i think i broke my hip .  
<chandler> okay  you start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes .  he &apos;s about my age 
<chandler> a - huh .  so he &apos;s rolling down the street and he starts to lose control ,  you know maybe he falls maybe hurts himself .  just then ,  a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes .  he jumps over the old guy and laughs ,  
<chandler> oh ,  thank you ,  sir or man - who &apos;s - two - years - younger - than - me  
<chandler>  i don &apos;t know ,  i don &apos; i don &apos; know !  i was just trying to get into a young mindset ,  you know ,  and it just started to flow .  
<chandler> the cold weather hurts my hip !  
<chandler> i &apos;m not sure what they did ,  but i &apos;m inclined to blame enron .  
<chandler> maybe i should quit and get a job that pays .  
<chandler> you know what ?  you know what ?  i think we &apos;re making too big a deal out of this .  ok ?  so we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things .  and maybe we start eating out of joey &apos;s refrigerator for a change .  you &apos;re chef .  .  .  what can you make out of backing soda and beer ?  
<chandler> no !  we &apos;re not borrowing money .  
<chandler> because we don &apos;t do that .  we are bings !  and if there &apos;s one thing my father taught me was .  .  .  well to always knock before going into the pool house .  .  .  but the other thing was never borrow money .  
<chandler> that &apos;s right !  i do !  and i &apos;m your man .  and i &apos;m going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard .  opening credits

<chandler> yes dear .  
<chandler> listen er .  . i need to ask you a favor but you can &apos;t tell monica anything about it .

<chandler> what ?  what do you mean you know ?  
<chandler> oh !  right .  
<chandler> anyway ,  err .  .  .  i need to borrow some money .

<chandler>  what ?  
<chandler> well !  we er .  . climbed up four flights of stairs ,  manueveored a narrow hallway ,  dodged a rabid pitbul .  .  .  but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky .

<chandler> we really need to take those tests ?  
<chandler> but i don &apos;t wanna do it in a cup !  
<chandler> it &apos;s weird !  in a doctor &apos;s office ?  
<chandler>  i cannot believe ross told you that !   and in my defense ,  it was a wendy &apos;s !  
<chandler> yeah ,  ok .  i &apos;m sure that doctor &apos;s office can &apos;t be worst than on a class trip to the hershey &apos;s factory !  
<chandler> oh ,  yeah !  rachel talks too !  
<chandler> deposit my specimen ?  you know ,  usually i have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk .  thanks ,  got it .  
<chandler> yeah ,  i guess !  
<chandler> oh ,  come on !  commercial break 
<chandler> why are you here ?  
<chandler>  no no no .  .  .  i mean ,  why ?  why is she here ?  ?  
<chandler> what !  ?   
<chandler> i &apos;d love to stay ,  but i have eh .  .  .   got a hot date .  .  .   
<chandler>  i think it just fell off .   
<chandler> yeah !  yeah .  .  .  the hard part is over !  
<chandler> i haven &apos;t .  .  .  i haven &apos;t even thought about the results yet .  .  .  i just assumed that everything was gonna be ok .  
<chandler>  yeah ,  but what if it &apos;s not ?  what if there is a reason why we can &apos;t have a baby ?  
<chandler>  oh ,  oh ,  yeah ,  ok ,  thanks .  i can &apos;t believe i didn &apos;t even think of that .  i guess i was just so worried about having to .  .  .  come here and do .  .  .   &apos;that &apos; .  .  .  
<chandler>  it was a  &quot; wendy &apos;s !  !   &quot;  
<chandler> hello ?  oh hi ,  doctor connelly .   no ,  she &apos;s not here but ,  you know ,  i can tell her .  should i be sitting down for this ?   oh .   well ,  so what does that mean ?   ok .  ok ,  thank you .  thanks .    
<chandler> doctor connelly just called .  
<chandler> actually it &apos;s both of us .  
<chandler> apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment .  
<chandler> it means that my guys won &apos;t get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do .   it means .  .  .  
<chandler>  it means that we can keep trying ,  but there &apos;s a good chance this may never happen for us .  
<chandler> i &apos;m sorry .  
<chandler> well ,  we &apos;re gonna .  .  .  we &apos;re gonna figure this out .  
<chandler>  wow !  fortunately she has a very pretty face !  
<chandler> oh ,  i can &apos;t believe my sperm have low motility because ,  let me tell you ,  when i was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places !  !  
<chandler> hi .  
<chandler> oh ,  damn it !   
<chandler> is that a hint ?  because we love you doctor connelly but we don &apos;t think we &apos;d want you to be our child !   wow ,  talking about an inhospitable environment !  
<chandler>  hey guys !  
<chandler> i think i can safely say that we all have family issues ,  work stuff and / or are sick .  
<chandler> but you come first !  
<chandler>  ok .  
<chandler> not as much fun as last time .  apparently you only get porn if you &apos;re giving a sperm sample .  
<chandler> well .  .  .  there &apos;s surrogacy ,  but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child ,  she has felt that watching a surrogate would be .  .  .  too hard for her .  
<chandler> yeah .  
<chandler> aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination ,  so .  .  .  we &apos;re talking about sperm donors .  
<chandler>  ah - ha !  
<chandler> i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but i don &apos;t think there is one .  
<chandler> hey !  look i brought a friend for dinner ,  this is zack ,  from work !  
<chandler> you guys haven &apos;t actually met before ,  but ,  boy !  you &apos;re both polite !   go to have a seat zack ,  and i &apos;ll get you a beer .  
<chandler>  so ,  zack &apos;s pretty nice ,  uh ?  
<chandler> so ,  how would you like to have a baby that &apos;s half yours and half his !  
<chandler> well ,  we &apos;re talking about sperm donors and zack may be the guy !  i mean ,  look ,  he &apos;s intelligent ,  he &apos;s healthy ,  he &apos;s athletic ,  i mean ,  he is  &quot; spermtastic &quot;  !  
<chandler> no ,  i invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him !  i mean ,  if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy ,  get to check him out .  
<chandler> i &apos;m telling you ,  he &apos;s great !  i mean ,  even if my sperm worked fine ,  i &apos;d think he &apos;d be the way to go !  
<chandler> ok !  
<chandler>  zack !  
<chandler> so what do you think ?  i want that guys genes for my kid !  those eyes ,  those cheeckbones !  
<chandler> you don &apos;t like him .  
<chandler> alright !  just follow my lead !   
<chandler> oh !  thanks ,  i &apos;m crazy about our place .  hey !  speaking of crazy .  .  .  do you have a history of mental illness in the family ?  
<chandler>  that &apos;s really not the kind of thing we are looking for zack .  
<chandler> you know what &apos;s not funny ?  male pattern baldness  
<chandler> i noticed you were enjoying that ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth .  did you have braces as a child ?  
<chandler>  we &apos;re teeth people zack !  
<chandler> you sure you don &apos;t wanna stick around a little longer ?  
<chandler> are you just tired now or are you always tired ,   &apos;cause that could be a sign of clinical depression .  
<chandler> ok .   
<chandler> i think we &apos;ve found our sperm !  
<chandler> yeah ,  you think so ,  well ?  should i ask him ?  
<chandler> why not ,  just because his great - grandmother was obese ,  our kids are gonna get that from you anyway !  
<chandler> yeah ,  he &apos;s better !  
<chandler> really ?  are you sure ?  
<chandler>  thank god ,  because i don &apos;t wanna do this either .  you know ,  i was just doing because i thought that was what you wanted to do .  you know ,  i &apos;m the husband ,  i &apos;m supposed to .  .  .  bring the sperm .  
<chandler> so you know this leaves us with .  .  .  
<chandler> how do you feel about that ?  
<chandler> me too .  i wanna find a baby that needs a home and i wanna raise it with you .  and i wanna mess it up in our own specific way .  
<chandler>  yeah .  
<chandler> we are gonna be great parents .  
<chandler> wait ,  if we &apos;re lucky ,  and we &apos;re really really really quiet ,  we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking !   
<chandler> hey ,  zack !  
<chandler> look ,  i just wanted to apologize for last night .  i got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable .  
<chandler> really ?  
<chandler> my wife and i have some boundary issues ,  you know ,  sometimes we ask inappropriate questions .  we &apos;re working on it .   
<chandler> you wouldn &apos;t know if jeanette &apos;s planning on keeping her baby ,  would ya ?  friends  -  923 - 924  -  the one in barbados 
<chandler> yeah ross ,  i mean .  .  .  we &apos;re excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we &apos;re gonna wanna do ,  you know ,   &quot; island &apos;s stuff &quot;  .  
<chandler> yeah ,  that &apos;s the same as  &quot; it has something to do with wind &quot;  .  
<chandler>  she does ?  
<chandler> i wouldn &apos;t read too much into it .  
<chandler> david ,  let me stop you there  &apos;cause i think i see where this is going .  i &apos;m not very good at giving advice .  so if you want advice ,  go to ross ,  monica ,  or .  .  .  joey ,  if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee .  
<chandler> seriously ,  we &apos;re gonna do this ?  
<chandler> oh ,  because his penis was too big .   oh ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  that &apos;s the kind of thing i do .   they broke up because mike didn &apos;t want to get married .  hey ,  what if you just let phoebe know you &apos;d be open to marriage ?  
<chandler> what ?  
<chandler> i didn &apos;t mean now .  .  .  
<chandler> well ,  you &apos;re welcome !  glad i could help .

<chandler> okay - dokay ,  you &apos;ve each won a game and i &apos;ve lost what &apos;s felt like a year of my life .  so everybody goes home a winner .

<chandler> i think you know .  
<chandler> this is what i want to do .  
<chandler>  she &apos;s an fbi agent ,  posing as a beauty contestant .   with ross seeing joey and rachel kissing .  rosss tares at them . ] 
<chandler> there &apos;s a hair in my coffee .   
<chandler> you know ,  it &apos;s funny .  every time you say  &quot; triplets ,  &quot;  i immediately think of three hot blonde 19 - year olds .

<chandler> see ?  intuitive !  
<chandler> which technically now you should give back !  
<chandler> i &apos;m so sorry ,  but you should have a sign out there or something .  or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door .   &quot; owen doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s adopted ,  and he also thinks that santa is real .  &quot;  
<chandler> owen didn &apos;t know he was adopted ,  and monica told him .  
<chandler> yeah ,  but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them ?

<chandler> she guessed 8 ,  9 ,  based on his drawings .   
<chandler> that sounds like fun .  
<chandler> i think she looks cute .    .  .  .  but i am wrong !

<chandler> hey !  monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects !

<chandler> he &apos;s not right for the part .  so if i suggest him ,  my bosses are gonna think i &apos;m an idiot !  and that &apos;s something they should learn on their own !  
<chandler> that &apos;s good !  i liked it ,  they didn &apos;t .   joey ,  for god &apos;s sake ,  go to work !   .  
<chandler> hey joe !

<chandler> lying is wrong !  
<chandler> i &apos;m a pretty little girl .  
<chandler> that &apos;s funny ,  we were doing the same thing !  
<chandler> yeah it is really pricey .  i mean ,  i freaked when i first heard the numbers .  
<chandler> it was pretty simple actually ,  i came up with a couple of cost - cutting solutions ,  wrote out a list and monica told me to go to hell .  
<chandler>  maybe you do that next time you get married !

<chandler> well ,  it &apos;s just with uhm ,  work and the stress of adoption ,  we just don &apos;t feel like we have the energy .  plus ,  we don &apos;t think it &apos;s fair that every year the burden falls on us .  
<chandler> no ,  no !  we made this decision together .  
<chandler> don &apos;t let yourself get manipulated this way !  
<chandler> we are supposed to make these decisions together !  did you not watch the doctor phil i taped for you ?  opening credits 
<chandler> why come all the way from kansas to do that ?

<chandler> dinner is at four ,  we &apos;ll never gonna make it back .

<chandler> well ,  you manheads aren &apos;t any better .  you lied about going to the game .  you knew it would make you late ,  and you still went anyway .  
<chandler> that would be a lot more convincing if you weren &apos;t drooling .  
<chandler> a little late for that .  
<chandler> uhm ,  we &apos;ve got turkey grease .  
<chandler> can you ever feel your ears ?  
<chandler>  oh ,  i left them on my bulldozer .  .  .  i don &apos;t have tools !

<chandler> and so incorrect !  
<chandler> uhm ,  thank you ,  but we &apos;re really trying not to get our hopes up .  
<chandler> yeah .  i mean ,  this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better .  .  
<chandler> i can develop a condition in which i talk and talk and no one hears a word .  
<chandler> so we &apos;re standing firm on the  &apos;not getting our hopes up &apos; ?  
<chandler> yes ,  but .  .  .  
<chandler> oh ,  screw it ,  i &apos;m gonna be a daddy !  !  opening credits

<chandler> plus i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor !  
<chandler> yeah ,  wow .  
<chandler> not for me it doesnt .   
<chandler> yeah ,  actually .  so ,  you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us ?  were very proud of it .  
<chandler> you should be .  youre really on top of stuff .  .  nothing else ,  then the two of us should talk .  
<chandler> yeah ,  i did .  
<chandler> it &apos;s wrong .  they made a mistake .  they think we &apos;re somebody else .  
<chandler> you have gotta stop !

<chandler> i know .  .  
<chandler> oh ,  honey .  .  
<chandler> monica ,  i want a baby too ,  but this woman is giving away her child .  she deserves to know who it &apos;s going to .

<chandler> you &apos;re jewish .  
<chandler> hey .  an open adoption .  there &apos;s a lot to go over ,  but i &apos;ll explain everything as we go through it .  
<chandler> the agency must have made some mistake .  my wife is not a reverend and i &apos;m not a doctor .  
<chandler> i could perform an operation on you and prove it if you &apos;d like .  
<chandler> well ,  our names really are monica and chandler .  we &apos;re from new york .  
<chandler> erica wait !  
<chandler> you have every reason to be upset .  we did lie .  but only because we &apos;ve been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long .  now we don &apos;t know how long it &apos;s gonna be before we can get another chance again .  
<chandler> erica ,  please .  just consider us .  ask them to see our file .  our last name &apos;s bing .  my wife &apos;s a chef and i &apos;m in advertising .  
<chandler> but you did like us .  and you should .  my wife &apos;s an incredible woman .  she &apos;s loving and devoted and caring .  and don &apos;t tell her i said this but the woman &apos;s always right .  .  .  i love my wife more than anything in this world .  and i .  .  .  it kills me that i can &apos;t give her a baby .  .  .  i really want a kid .  and when that day finally comes ,  i &apos;ll learn how to be a good dad .  but my wife .  .  .  she &apos;s already there .  she &apos;s a mother .  .  .  without a baby .  .  .  please ?   
<chandler> you still want that baby ?   
<chandler>  seriously ,  answer faster !

<chandler> i know .  
<chandler> i dont know what you mean ,  giant talking cigarette !  oh ,  by the way ,  phoebe called just as i was getting into nancys car ,  so if she asks you ,  i was at work all day .  
<chandler> we dont .  not until it &apos;s a hundred percent .  i mean ,  why upset everybody over nothing .  
<chandler> i know .  gooooood luck with it .  
<chandler> hey !  
<chandler> is it me ,  or have the greetings gone downhill around here ?  
<chandler> yeah  i &apos;m not having an affair .  nancy is our realtor .  
<chandler>  .  .  . and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice - cream truck can go by .  
<chandler> actually ,  we already found a house we love .  
<chandler> bet you wish i was having an affair now ,  huh ?  time lapse 
<chandler> i know this is really hard and we &apos;re really sorry .  
<chandler>  you know that &apos;s not the reason joe .   
<chandler> hey ,  that &apos;s .  .  .  &apos;joincidence &apos; with a  &apos;c &apos; !   
<chandler> if you win ,  we give up the birds .  
<chandler> but if we win ,  we get your apartment .  
<chandler> dangerous liaisons .  
<chandler> fancy .  
<chandler> fancy guest .  
<chandler> thanks man .  
<chandler> would you all stop yelling in our apartment !  you are ruining moving day for us !   
<chandler>  wow !  listen ,  we had a good run .  you know ,  what was it ?  four ?  five months ?  i mean ,  that &apos;s more than most people have in a lifetime !  so ,  good - bye ,  take care ,  bye - bye then !   
<chandler> well ,  i think ,  i think ross knows about me and monica .  
<chandler> look ,  we &apos;re not just messing around !  i love her .  okay ,  i &apos;m in love with her .  
<chandler>  hey .  
<chandler> i know .   
<chandler> no problem roomie .   
<chandler> sure !  
<chandler> little toast here .  i know this isn &apos;t exactly the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned ,  but for me ,  this has been really great ,  you know ,  i think because it didn &apos;t involve divorce or projectile vomiting .  anyway ,  i was just thinking ,  i mean ,  if you &apos;d gone to vail ,  and if you guys &apos;d been with your family ,  if you didn &apos;t have syphilis and stuff ,  we wouldn &apos;t be all together ,  you know ?  so i guess what i &apos;m trying to say is that i &apos;m very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked .  
<chandler> here ,  here !  
<chandler> hello ?  it &apos;s nancy ,  they responded to our offer .

<chandler> hey ,  can i talk to you about this groomsman thing ?  if you pick ross ,  he &apos;ll walk you down the isle just fine .  but if you choose me ,  you &apos;ll be getting some comedy !  
<chandler> let me tell you why you need to pick me .   see ,  when i was a kid ,  i was always left out of everything ,  you know ,  and it really made me feel .  .  .  insecure .  you know ,  i was always picked last in gym .  even behind that big fat exchange student who didn &apos;t even know the rules to baseball .  i mean ,  this guy would strike out and then run to third .  anyway ,  if i &apos;m the only one left out of this wedding ,  i just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back .  
<chandler>  y - y - yeeesss !  make  &quot; groom &quot;  for chandler .

<chandler> i see .  
<chandler> is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes ?  
<chandler> we close escrow tomorrow ,  so seeing another house can only confuse us ,  and we &apos;re easily confused .  we &apos;re not very bright .  
<chandler> what do you think pheebs ?  
<chandler> yeah .  
<chandler> you &apos;re kidding !

<chandler> alright alright ,  we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house .  we can still get out .  
<chandler> will we love it so much with her next door ?  and she &apos;s gonna be louder out here too .  just the crickets and   &quot; oh my god &quot;  !  
<chandler>  well ,  we have to do something .  we can &apos;t have her living next door .   oh ,  that does it too .
