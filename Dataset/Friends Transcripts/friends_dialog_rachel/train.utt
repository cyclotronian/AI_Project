probably .  but you know ,  i &apos;ll tell you something .  passion is way overrated .  
it is .  eventually ,  it kind of .  .  .  burns out .  but hopefully ,  what you &apos;re left with is trust ,  and security ,  and .  .  .  well ,  in the case of my ex - wife ,  lesbianism .  so ,  you know ,  for all of those people who miss out on that passion .  .  .  thing ,  there &apos;s all that other good stuff .  
but ,  um .  .  .  i don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to be you .  
uh - uh .  see ,  i see .  .  .  .  big passion in your future .

oh god !  you see ,  that &apos;s what i was afraid of !  
okay ,  okay .  .  .  when barry was engaged to you ,  he and i .  .  . kind of .  .  .  had a little thing on the side .  
i know .  i know ,  and when he proposed to me ,  everyone said  &quot; don &apos;t do it ,  he &apos;s just gonna do to you what he did to rachel ,  &quot;  and now i feel so stupid .

 ahem .  .  .  um .  .  .  crystal duck .  
 f - hah .  .  .  .  flennin .  .  .  .  
i think this is so great !  i mean ,  you and ross !  d - did you have any idea ?  
well ,  given that he &apos;s desperately in love with you ,  he probably wouldn &apos;t mind getting a cup of coffee or something .  
rachel ,  what &apos;re you gonna say to him ?  
yeah ,  but if it &apos;s good news ,  you should tell him now .  
here ,  look ,  alright ,  does this help ?   
ni - chou chi - ma !    
ross !  excuse me ,  pardon me ,  excuse me .  .  .  .   
hi .  
oh ,  no ,  no ,  i don &apos;t have one .  i just need to talk to my friend .  you have a boarding pass .

ok ,  alright ,  ok ,  um .  .  .  then could you please ,  uh .  .  .  just give him a message for me ?  please ?  this is very important .  
uh ,  so ,  uh ,  rach ,  uh .  .  .  do you wanna save this wrapping paper ,  i mean ,  it &apos;s only a little bit torn .  .  .  so are you gonna go for it with ross or should i just throw it out ?  
i don &apos;t know .  i don &apos;t know .  .  .  i thought about it all the way there ,  and i thought about it all the way back .  .  .  and ,  uh ,  oh ,  you guys ,  y &apos;know ,  it &apos;s ross .  y &apos;know what i mean ?  i mean ,  it &apos;s ross .  
no ,  i mean ,  i mean ,  when you &apos;re at the fifteenth date ,  y &apos;know ,  you &apos;re already in a very relationshippy place .  y &apos;know ,  it &apos;s .  .  .  you &apos;re committed .  
why isn &apos;t it working out ?  
is he not cute enough for you ?  
does he not make enough money ?  
maybe there &apos;s someone else .  
is there ?  is there someone else ?  
hey ,  great skirt !  birthday present ?  
oh ,  from who ?  
well ,  it &apos;s the thought .  hey ,  doesn &apos;t ross &apos;s flight get in in a couple hours ?  at gate 27 - b ?  
oh ,  why ?  
 no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no pressure ,  no pressure !  
i am not  &apos;so &apos; !  ok ,  i was a teensy bit weird at first ,  but .  .  .  i &apos;ll be good .  i promise .   
it &apos;s me ,  carl .  
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;d rather go out with him than me .  
can &apos;t do it ,  can you ?  
i don &apos;t get it .  what do you see in this guy ,  anyway ?  
rachel ,  come on .  give us a chance .  
no ,  no ,  no .  .  .  why ,  because it might get weird for everyone else ?  who cares about them .  this is about us .  look ,  i - i &apos;ve been in love with you since ,  like ,  the ninth grade .  
i know .  
whoa ,  whoa ,  whoa .  what makes you think we &apos;re gonna break up ?  
 no .  but .  .  .  it only has to happen once .  look ,  you and i both know we are perfect for each other ,  right ?  i mean .  .  .  so ,  the only question is .  .  .  are you attracted to me ?  
well ,  start looking .   
exactly !  and you just know i &apos;m gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic !  
heh .  .  .  y &apos;know ?  
what ?  
ok ,  so this is pretty much what &apos;s happened so far .  ross was in love with rachel since ,  you know ,  forever ,  but every time he tried to tell her ,  something kind of got in the way ,  like cats ,  and italian guys .  finally chandler was like  &quot; forget about her &quot;  but when ross was in china on his dig ,  chandler let it slip that ross was in love with rachel .  she was like ,   &quot; oh my god .  &quot;  so she went to the airport to meet him when he came back ,  but what she didn &apos;t know was ,  that ross was getting off the plane with another woman .  uh - oh !  so ,  that &apos;s pretty much everything you need to know .  but ,  enough about us .  so ,  how &apos;ve you been ?  opening credits  
 rach !  
it was ,  it was great .  oh ,  what happened ?  
you &apos;re bleeding .

but .  .  .  
he said .  .  . he said ,  he said that they &apos;re having a great time .  i &apos;m sorry .  but ,  the silver lining ,  if you wanna see it ,  is that he made the decision all by himself !  without any outside help whatsoever .

i &apos;m still on  &quot; no .  &quot;  
what &apos;s goin &apos; on ?  
rachel ,  how did this happen ?  
where ?  
whoa ,  whoa .  and the fact that you dumped him because he hit on phoebe ?  
 so ,  uh ,  he &apos;s back .  
no ,  not a problem .  
how &apos;re you doing ?  
ooh ,  that bad ,  huh ?  
look ,  i can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable .  it &apos;s one of my gifts .  
you gotta tell ross how you feel .  
what about her ?  they &apos;ve only been going out for two weeks .  ross has been in love with you for like 10 years .  
well ,  i gotta go .  bye .  bye ,  rach .  
yeah ,  that &apos;s kinda what i meant by  &quot; bye !  &quot;  
what &apos;s goin &apos; on ?  
ok .  well ,  before i say anything ,  i just need to know ,  is this one of those things where you break up with a guy ,  and then i tell you what i think ,  and then the next day you get back together with the guy ,  and i look like a complete idiot ?  
well ,  then ,  i think ,  i think the guy is scum .  i hate him .  i mean i actuallyi - i physically hate him .  i always have .  you are way too good to be with a guy like that .  
you deserve to be with someone who appreciates you ,  and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing ,  and adorable ,  and sexy you are ,  you know ?  someone who wakes up every morning thinking  &quot; oh my god ,  i &apos;m with rachel &quot;  .  you know ,  someone who makes you feel good ,  the way i am with julie .   was there a second of all ?  
 ok ,  i just wanna be really sure this time .  andie mcdowell &apos;s the girl from four weddings and a funeral ,  right ?  
rachel ,  do you have any muffins left ?  
 oh ,  you &apos;re losin &apos; your apron here ,  let me get it .  there you go .   
oh ,  no wonder i don &apos;t feel full .  
i went shopping with monica all day ,  and i had a salad .  
um ,  we went shopping for um ,  for ,  fur .  
yes ,  and then i realized i &apos;m against that ,  and uh ,  so then we bought some ,   uh ,  boobs .  
honey ,  relax .  ross is great with him .   don &apos;t look so surprised .  i &apos;m a lovely person .  
hello ?  oh ,  hi ,  juhi ,  jew !   uh huh ?   uh huh ?   ok .   um ,  sure ,  that &apos;d be great .  see ya then .  bye .   
so ?  
hey ,  where is everybody ?  
just out .  had some lunch ,  just me ,  little quality time with me .  thanks for your jacket .  
okay .  
you know what probably happened ?  someone musta stolen my credit card .  
that is an excellent excellent question .  that is excellent .  
judy .  
julie .  
jody !  
look ,  when it started i was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother &apos;s girlfriend .  and then ,  one thing led to another and ,  before i knew it ,  we were .  .  . shopping .  
honey ,  wait .  we only did it once .  it didn &apos;t mean anything to me .  
really ,  rachel ,  i was thinking of you the whole time .  look ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  all right .  i never meant for you to find out !  
that is not true !  
did it ever occur to you that i might just be that stupid ?  
i don &apos;t know what else to say .  
i feel terrible ,  i really do .  
rachel ,   say that i &apos;m friends with her ,  we spend some time together .  is that so terrible ?  
it &apos;s that terrible ?  
me ?  what are you talking about ?  nobody could steal me from you .  i mean ,  just because i &apos;m friends with her doesn &apos;t make me any less friends with you .  i mean ,   you &apos;re my .  .  . we &apos;re ,  we &apos;re .  .  . oh ,  i love you .  
look ,  i know that you &apos;re in a place right now where you really need to hate julie &apos;s guts ,  but she didn &apos;t do anything wrong .  i mean ,  she was just a girl who met a guy ,  and now they go out .  i really think that if you gave her a chance ,  you &apos;d like her .  would you just give that a chance ,  for me ?  
so .  
i know ,  i probably shouldn &apos;t even tell you this ,  but i &apos;m pretty much totally intimidated by you .  
yes .  oh my god ,  are you kidding ?  ross is so crazy about you ,  and i really wanted you to like me ,  and ,  it &apos;s probably me being totally paranoid ,  but i kinda got the feeling that maybe you don &apos;t .  
oy .  
thanks .  hey ,  listen ,  would you like to go to a movie sometime or something ?  
i &apos;d love it too .  shoot ,  i gotta go .  so ,  i &apos;ll talk to you later .  
bye .   
they were huge .  when she sneezed ,  bats flew out of them .  
you &apos;re stomping .  it &apos;s disturbing my birds .  
thank you .  i &apos;m going to rejoin my dinner party .  
i miss janice though .    &quot; hello ,  chandler bing .  &quot;  
stop with the broom ,  we &apos;re not making noise .   
mr . _heckles .  
well ,  what about his family ?  
would you look at this dump ?  he hated us .  this is his final revenge !  
april 18th ,  excessive noise .  italian guy &apos;s gay roommate comes home with the dry - cleaning .  well that &apos;s excellent .  
rache ,  i think we have enough regular lamps .  
it doesn &apos;t go with any of my stuff .  
you don &apos;t have any stuff .  
no .  
mmmmm .  
hey ,  rache .  you know what we haven &apos;t played in a while ?  
hide the lamp .  
did you know i was allergic to shellfish ?  
you just abandoned your whole belief system .  i mean ,  before ,  i didn &apos;t agree with you ,  but at least i respected you .  how ,  how ,  how are you going to go into work tomorrow ?  how ,  how are you going to face the other science guys ?  how ,  how are you going to face yourself ?   oh !  that was fun .  so who &apos;s hungry ?  
i am .  let me just get my coat .   
ok ,  all right .  it was an accident ,  i swear ,  all right .  i was putting on my jacket ,  and the thing ,  and the lamp ,  and it broke .  
ok ,  i didn &apos;t see it ,  because i was putting on my jacket ,  but i uh want to believe you .   
neat .  i &apos;m gonna die alone .  
of course i am .  i reject anyone who &apos;s crazy enough to actually go out with me ,  and then i bitch about the fact that there aren &apos;t any great women out there .  
you are not a freak .  you &apos;re a guy .  
no ,  honey ,  in a wonderful way .  you know what you want now .  most guys don &apos;t even have a clue .  you are ready to take risks ,  you are ready to be vulnerable ,  and intimate with someone .  
you &apos;re there !  
no .  um ,  i know you like this ,  and i want you to have it .  i think it &apos;ll look good in our apartment .  
oh ,  gosh ,  this is so weird .  i mean ,  his whole life was in this apartment ,  and now it &apos;s gone .  you know ,  i think it would be nice if we just took a few moments ,  for mr . _heckles .  i mean ,  he was kind of a pain ,  he was ,  but he was a person .  you &apos;re all going to hell .  
hi .  
yeah ,  i &apos;m looking for phoebe ,  does she still live here ?  
great .  uhh ,  just tell her her husband stopped by .   
oh ,  i don &apos;t know .  umm ,  how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with fun bobby out on the terrace .

hey rach ,  wanna hear the new song i &apos;m thinkin &apos; of singing this afternoon ?  i wrote it this morning in the shower .  
uh ,  rachel ,  sweetheart ,  could i see ya for a minute ?  
f . y . i .  .  i &apos;ve decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on sunday afternoons .  her name is stephanie .  .  .  something .  she &apos;s supposed to be very good .  
rachel ,  it &apos;s not that your friend is bad ,  it &apos;s that she &apos;s so bad ,  she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around .  
uh .  .  .   
but ,  but this is my gig .  this is where i play .  my ,  my name is written out there in chalk .  you know ,  you can &apos;t just erase chalk .  
and he &apos;s going to be paying this woman ?  why doesn &apos;t he just give her like a throne ,  and a crown ,  and like a ,  you know ,  gold stick with a ball on top .  
yeah ,  ok .  you probably did everything you could .  
i ,  i don &apos;t know .  
you don &apos;t clean the cappuccino machine ?  
oh ,  all right ,  fine ,  fine ,  fine .   
really ?  
oh !  oh my god .  this is so exciting .  how much am i gonna get ?  
well you said that he &apos;s paying the people who are playing .  
well ,  i &apos;m not gonna be the only one who &apos;s not getting paid .  
 terry &apos;s a jerk ,  and he won &apos;t let me work ,  and i hate central perk !  
 just call me angel of the monring .  angel !  just touch my cheek before you leave me .  oh baby .  just call me angel of the morning .  angel !  and slowly turn away .  i won &apos;t beg you to stay ,  with me .   
oh ,  hi .  
thank you .  
eight dollars and 27 cents .  but not really ,   &apos;cause i put in the first two ,  just to ,  you know ,  get the ball rolling ,  and to make myself feel better .  
no .  this whole like playing - for - money thing is so not good for me .  you know ,  i don &apos;t know ,  when i sang  &quot; su - su - suicide ,  &quot;  i got a dollar seventy - five .  but then ,   &quot; smelly cat ,  &quot;  i got 25 cents and a condom .  so you know ,  now i just feel really bad for smelly cat .  
it &apos;s not even that .  i used to do my songs because it made me happy ,  but now it &apos;s like ,  it &apos;s just all about the money .  
really ?  from who ?  
okay ,  what is it about me ?  do i not look fun enough ?  is there something .   .   .  repellent .   .   .  about me ?  
 ow ,  ow ,  ow ,  ow ,  ow ,  ow ,  ow .   ow ,  ow ,  ow ,  ow ,  ow .   .  she &apos;s insane ,  the woman is insane .  it &apos;s before work ,  it &apos;s after work ,  it &apos;s during work .  she &apos;s got me doing butt clenches at my desk .  and now ,  they won &apos;t bring me my mail anymore .   
oohh ,  um ,  no ,  i don &apos;t think that &apos;s the problem .   &apos;cause we went ,  um ,  dancing the other night and the way he held me so close ,  and the way he was looking into my eyes i just like .  .  .  definitely felt something .  
 ooh ,  oh ,  rachel ,  don &apos;t look .  
woah ,  woah ,  woah ,  you have a date ?  
but uh ,  uh ,  what about uh ,  ross and uh .   .   .

i didn &apos;t get a cat .  
no ,  no it &apos;s not interesting .  okay ,  it &apos;s very ,  very not interesting .  in fact it &apos;s actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting .  
you had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me .  
i was doing great with julie before i found out about you .  
then you should have said something before i met her .  
there was never a good time .  
not ,  not ,  not every night .  you know ,  and .  .  .  and it &apos;s not like i didn &apos;t try ,  rachel ,  but things got in the way ,  y &apos;know ?  like ,  like italian guys or ex - fiancs or ,  or ,  or italian guys .  
the point is i .  .  .  i don &apos;t need this right now ,  okay .  it ,  it &apos;s too late ,  i &apos;m with somebody else ,  i &apos;m happy .  this ship has sailed .

no ,  that &apos;s my stepdad .  my real dad &apos;s the one that ran out on us before i was born .  
ya know i remember my father ,  all dressed up in the red suit ,  the big black boots ,  and the patent leather belt ,  sneakin around downstairs .  he didn &apos;t want anybody to see him but he &apos;d be drunk so he &apos;d stumble ,  crash into something and wake everybody up .  
hey ,  anyone hear from phoebe yet ?  
don &apos;t you have to be claymation to say stuff like that ?  
hey ,  rach ,  you know what ?  i think ,  i think i know what &apos;ll make you feel better .  how  &apos;bout you make a list about me .  
c &apos;mon rachel .  
see there ,  you uhh ,  alright ,  ya ,  you did what i said .

ahh ,  if it was mistletoe ,  i was gonna kiss ya .  
rach ,  these are for you .  
hey ,  if she were marrying a guy ,  she &apos;d be like the worst lesbian ever .  
yeah ,  and she &apos;s really nice too .  she taught me all about how to work the cameras ,  and smell - the - fart acting .  
nice !  
yeah ,  it &apos;s just so strange .  i mean ,  she probably woke up today and thought ,   &quot; ok ,  i &apos;ll have some breakfast ,  and then i &apos;ll take a little walk ,  and then i &apos;ll have my massage .  &quot;  little did she know god was thinking ,   &quot; ok ,  but that &apos;s it .  &quot;  oh ,  but the weirdest thing was ,  ok ,  i was cleansing her aura when she died ,  and when the spirit left her body ,  i don &apos;t think it went very far .  
well ,  of course ,  lambs are scarier .  otherwise the movie would &apos;ve been called silence of the ducks .  
yes ,  and this with the cigarette butt in it ,  is that decaf ?  
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re so uptight about your mom comin &apos; .  
i don &apos;t know .  i mean ,  she obviously has some kind of unfinished business .   sit up !  
mom !  is it a restaurant ?  who can tell ?  but i guess that &apos;s the fun .  
pretty much .  
hi ,  mrs .  green .   
believe me ,  sometimes that happens .  father &apos;s house to the sorority house to my husband &apos;s house .  i am just so proud of you .  
i don &apos;t know .  who &apos;s soupy sales ?  [at rachel and monica &apos;s 
yeah ,  well just be glad he &apos;s not playing a smaller instrument .  
i know .  and mom ,  i realize you and daddy were upset when i didn &apos;t marry barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything ,  but this is just so much better for me ,  you know ?  you and i think ,  oh ,  this is what i want .  
for .  .  . me .  
 all right .  tell me if this is too cute .  lesbian wedding ,  chicken breasts .  
and you had no idea they weren &apos;t getting along ?  
they didn &apos;t fight a lot ?  
hey ,  look who &apos;s up .

naa .  a while ago i got a sah out of him ,  which i thought ,  ya know ,  might turn into sah - condary caregiver but .  .  .  hey ,  would you uh ,  would you hold him for a sec ,   &apos;cause i ,  i gotta take this off .

ok ,  here ,  here .  there we go .  
it &apos;s alright ,  it &apos;s no big deal .  
yeah ,  definitely ,  i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll feel totally different when it &apos;s our baby .  
what ?  
uhh ,  yeah .  i mean ,  actually i kinda think that we &apos;ll have ,  we &apos;ll have two babies .  
yeah .  ya know ,  a boy and a girl .  hopefully the girl will come first so ben here won &apos;t feel too competitive .  
well ,  we won &apos;t wanna raise kids in the city so we &apos;ll probably move to uh ,  scarsdale .  
yeah ,  that way i figure ,  ya know ,  we &apos;ll be far enough away from our parents that we don &apos;t have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want .  and yes ,  i know ,  the taxes are a little higher than ,  let &apos;s say ,  nassau county but the school system &apos;s supposedly great .  
huh ?  
does it matter ?  you &apos;re ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off .  
i &apos;ve got a question .  richard made plans again with the guys .  
 ok ,  what the hell happened back there ?  
well i &apos;m sorry ,  i think about stuff .  ya know ,  i mean ,  you &apos;re at work ,  you &apos;re assembling bones ,  your mind wanders .

no ,  no ,  i mean ,  ya know ,  i ,  i read a book and there was a girl named emily and i thought ,  i thought that might be good .  
the big book of childrens &apos; names .  
yeah .  
ok fine .  
we &apos;re not done .  
ok ,  then you &apos;re gonna have to understand that you &apos;re with a guy who &apos;s not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we &apos;re gonna end up together and if that scares you ,  tough ,   &apos;cause you &apos;re gonna have to deal with that .  
good ,   &apos;cause i love you .  
yeah .  
well that &apos;s the first time we &apos;ve said that .  
well ,  i &apos;m gonna kiss you .

uh ,  hey ,  rach let me ask you something .  uh ,  i was just over there talking to monica and chandler ,  boy they are really tight .  
yeah that &apos;s not such a bad situation they got going over there .  i &apos;m thinking of getting me one of those .  
well ,  the reason i think monica and chandler are so great 
is because they were friends first .  y &apos;know ?  so i asked myself ,   &quot; who are my friends ?  &quot;  you and phoebe ,  and i saw you first .  so 
i &apos;m saying maybe you and i crank it up a notch .  
i &apos;ll treat you real nice .   
won &apos;t - won &apos;t that take longer ?  
come here to me .  no - no ,  you come here to me .

y &apos;know what ?  just - just follow my lead .   
okay ,  i don &apos;t think we can turn anymore !  
i can &apos;t believe that didn &apos;t work !  
 hey !  
 well look ,  hey ,  it &apos;s all your fault !  
ooh ,  god ,  it &apos;s him !  it &apos;s that cop !  god ,  i can &apos;t believe it !  he found me !

congratulations !  ohh ,  that &apos;s great !  
boy ,  that guy &apos;s underwear sucks !  
i got this pair marked excess ,  i gotta tell ya ,  there was no room for excess anything in there .  
wow !  well ,  if you nail the interview ,  you &apos;ll get it !  
you wanna work on your interview skills ?  
okay !  all right ,  let &apos;s start with the handshake .  hi .  
oh hey ,  how &apos;d the interview go ?  
did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair ?  
so what happened ?  
what happened ?  
you kissed him ?  !  
well you coulda tried ,  not kissing him .  
 hey rach ,  a guy from ralph lauren called ,  you got a second interview !  
i bet that kiss isn &apos;t looking like such a big mistake now ,  is it ?  
a kiss ?  what are you talking about ?  
come on ,  rach .  
he probably wants you back because you &apos;re right for the job .  
oh rachel look ,  don &apos;t say that ,  i think you just need a hug from joey .  come on .  come on .   she &apos;s back !  hot girl &apos;s back !  
hi !   
thank you .  uhh  
what ?   
excuse me ?   
 ugh ,  you will not believe what that sleaze - ball from ralph lauren did too me !   
you got ink on your lip .  
ah ,  first ,  i - i would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again .  meeting is being videotaped .  
 okay .  umm ,  well ,  first i would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh ,  for yelling at you .  
now you &apos;re probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah ,   who did ,  who did not umm ,  yell at you and storm out ,  and i think that &apos;s a big mistake and here &apos;s why .  i made a huge fool of myself and i came back ,  that shows courage .  when i thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job ,  i said no .  that shows integrity .  and ,  i was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage .   okay umm ,  now i know i already said courage ,  but y &apos;know you gotta have courage .  and umm ,  and finally when i thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace ,  i said no and i was not litigious .  {by the way ,  litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against .  so she didn &apos;t want to sue him .  don &apos;t worry ,  i had to look it up too . } so there you go ,  you got ,  you got  courage ,  you got integrity ,  you got  courage again ,  and not litigious .  look mr 
zelner !  right !  i knew that !  i really ,  really want this job and i think ,  i think i would be really good at it .  
 oh !  you are ?  
really ?  oh thank you !  oh oh ,  would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug ?

nah ,  while you &apos;re at ross &apos;s if you see any lying around 
 rach !  it &apos;s me !  pick up !   
i need a few more things to make the margaritas .  uhh ,  i need some salt ,  some margarita mix ,  and tequila .  
see if he has ice .  
 hello ross ?  it &apos;s emily .   i know this is out of the blue but uh ,  i &apos;m getting married tomorrow .  well ,  maybe i am .  i keep thinking about you and i &apos;m wondering if - if we made a mistake giving up so fast .  are you thinking about me ?  of course you &apos;re not ,  but if you are ,  call me tonight .  okay ,  bye .  
 nooo !  
well thank god you were here !  i mean ,  we have to erase that !  
we have too !  i mean what if ross &apos;s hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together ?  is that what you want ?  ross back with that controlling ,  neurotic ,  crazy emily ?  the emily that wouldn &apos;t let him see you ?  
i &apos;m his sister ,  okay ?  i love him !  i don &apos;t want to see him get hurt !  come on !  doesnt that give me the right to control himhelp him ?  
no ,  look ,  she &apos;s obviously unstable ,  okay ?  i mean she &apos;s thinking about running out on her wedding day .   okay ,  fine !  but i mean ,  look at the position she &apos;s putting him in !  what &apos;s he gonna do ?  ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage ?  !  i mean ,  who would do that ?  !   okay ,  fine ,  all right ,  but that &apos;s y &apos;know ,  it &apos;s different !  although it did involve a lot of the same people .  
y &apos;know what ,  this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she &apos;s trying to play on him .  
your messages have been erased .  
all right ,  i guess we should go .  
oh yeah right !   
there &apos;s nothing we can do .  you erased the message !  
well ,  if you &apos;re gonna be totally rational about this ,  i can &apos;t argue with you !  all right ?  fine ,  if you wanna tell him ,  tell him .  i just don &apos;t want to be a part of it .   
wow !  play that message for emily and this whole problem goes away !  
rach ,  what uh ,  what are you doing here ?  
y &apos;know ,  it - it doesn &apos;t matter .  the important thing is that you &apos;re here .  you &apos;re my friend ,  and you &apos;re here .  oh !   
the most amazing thing happened tonight .  i thought my number was up .  i had an actual near death experience !  
okay ,  okay ,  we were on the ride along with gary ,  right ?  
and somebody took a shot at me !  
no ,  a car backfired ,  but  i thought somebody was taking a shot at me .  and rach ,  i i survived !  and i was filled with this - this great respect for life .  y &apos;know ?  i - i want to experience every moment .  i want to seize every opportunity .  i - i am seeing everything so - so clearly now .  
 okay ,  why are you here ?  
you talked to her ?  
well ,  okay ,  what - what did she say ?  
wow !  
huh ?  yeah !  yes ,  of course !  
right .  i guess ,  i guess i should call emily .  
okay ,  look ,  yesterday i would &apos;ve even considered calling her back ,  but my ex - wife calls on the same day i have a near death experience .  i mean ,  that - that has got to mean something !  
you weren &apos;t there !  okay ,  maybe this is something that i - i &apos;m supposed to seize !  y &apos;know ?  
huh .  
that does make sense .  because i do wanna seize some opportunity ,  but i - i really don &apos;t wanna see or talk to her .  
yeah .  maybe today is just ,  close call day .  
hey ,  thanks rach .   
oh wait - wait - wait !  the message is blinking .  maybe you didn &apos;t erase it .  
  &quot; hey ross ,  it &apos;s you !  &quot;   oh yeah ,  no that &apos;s - that &apos;s an old message ,  nobody needs to hear that .

what ?  
why would the copy guy say he was ralph lauren ?  
hi rachel .  
you didnt cancel the fabric order from taiwan ?  
thats not true ?  
oh thats interesting ?  because i checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you ,  rachel .  
listen to me .  if you think sleeping with ralph is going to get you my job .  you are sadly mistaken .  
but why didnt you just tell her the truth .  
well ,  hey ,  what if kenny were the real brains behind the whole company ?  you know .  what if kenny hired that ralph lauren guy to be the pretty front man ?  huh ,  did she ever think of that ?  
just for a second .  
well ,  the only thing you can do .  sleep with ralph lauren .  
ohh ,  sleep with kenny .  
hi rachel .  ohh ,  ive been meaning to ask you .  have you seen the new ralph lauren sheets ?  ohh ,  what am i thinking .  of course you have .  
oh ,  really ?  
oh my god .  he just gave you the coldest look i have ever seen .  its like he hates you .  then it is true .  
ohh honey come here .   ohh it will be ok .  weve all been there .

this would be a beautiful place to get married ,  yeah ,  but i wouldnt put the aisle there and i would never have the ceremony there !   i mean youd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch .   
oh sorry didnt mean to interrupt .  its just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here ?  waiting list .  sorry !

its just not really who i am .  y &apos;know ,  ive always been happier when why am i telling you this ?  you dont care about this stuff .  
when im in a relationship ,  i love having a girlfriend .  
someone i can spoil ,  yknow ?  
uh - huh !  let me ask you something ?  
do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone ?  
and if that person is already in your life ,  you should do something about it right ?  
all right then ,  its settled .  
im gettin back together with my ex - girlfriend .

i hope its you .  
first of all um ,  i love you both so much and youre both so important to me 
yes !  !  !  oh !  !  
if phoebe were my maid of honor 
rachel would be phoebes ,  i would be rachels ,  that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset .  
because then i dont have to !  
im really not deciding !  
hey rachel ?  
umm ,  when i get married will you be my maid of honor ?  
uh - hmm .  
oh !  well ,  if thats what you want 
but why does it even matter ?  !  
because this one is now !  and - and its two of our best friends !  who knows what youre gonna marry !  
 you wouldnt !  okay look ,  rachel i know you really want to do this ,  but i - ive never been maid of honor to anyone before !  and i know youve done it at least twice !

 i dont want to marry chandler !  
ive got cold feet .

people are doing it in front of my book !  
my doctoral dissertation is in the library at school ,  i went to see it ,  and there were students makin babies right in the middle of the paleontology section !

yeah .  
bye guys .  
 hey ,  thank you so much .   
hey !  
no - no - no - no - no !  its a surprise ,  but its gonna be tricky though because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while .  
where are you gettin this ?  
oh .  oh .  
hey joey ,  yknow what ?  you are way too good for her .  
no !  no .  dont do that ,  just next time make sure she really likes me .  
yeah ?  
oh ,  okay ,  time &apos;s up !  
does south oregon have a sports - team ?   there you go .   
 &apos;cause you invited your assistant .  
oh !  why didn &apos;t you tell me ?  i made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin .  
oh ,  it &apos;s not !  
 they &apos;re here already ?  how are they doing this ?  
i ,  uh ,  wanted to see if your offer to spend thanksgiving with you is still good .  
we kinda broke up this morning .

all right .  we &apos;re gonna take clunkers to rosss .  we &apos;ll be back in a minute .   
yeah .  
half hour .   
all right ,  rach ,  the big question is ,  does he like you ?  all right ?  because if he doesn &apos;t like you ,  this is all a moo - point .  
yeah ,  it &apos;s like a cow &apos;s opinion .  it just doesn &apos;t matter .  it &apos;s moo .  
please ,  don &apos;t listen to joey ,  okay .  would you look at him ?  he - hes obviously depressed .  he &apos;s away from his family; he &apos;s spending thanksgiving with strangers .  what he needs right now is for you to be his friend .  
fine !  take their advice .  no one ever listens to me .  when the package is this pretty ,  no one cares what &apos;s inside .   
hey .  
not bad .  
thanks .  
a year .  on and off .  i kinda thought we &apos;d end up together .  i don &apos;t anymore .  
yeah .  
it &apos;s weird .  i always used to assume ,  that i would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given .  but lately it &apos;s like what if it &apos;s not .  do you ever have that feeling ?  
why ?  
you have all the answers ,  don &apos;t you ?  
hey ,  thanks for talking to me .  
what did joey say ?  i like you back ?  
wait - wait a minute; that doesn &apos;t make any sense .

right there !  that &apos;s my car !   hey !  !  
i can &apos;t believe this !   
hey !  tag &apos;s still talking to the police .

no ,  you didn &apos;t .  the only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us .  
yeah ,  so ,  please don &apos;t fire me for doing this .   
wouldnt it be easier if we just moved ?  
eh ,  somebodys in a good mood !

ino !  i didn &apos;t read the box before i opened it .  and you can &apos;t return a box after you &apos;ve opened the box .  
because it &apos;s too delicious .  
no - no - no !  it is going to be okay ,  because mrs .  braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win !  the only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate ,   mommas little bakery .   i feel terrible ,  im a horrible ,  horrible ,  horrible person .  
joseph francis tribbiani are you home yet ?  !  !  
well ,  ill tell you rachel karen green ,  i had plans with joey tonight and he left me this note .   
another cheesecake came !  they delivered it to the wrong address again !  
i cant seem to say goodbye .  
well ive forgotten what it tastes like okay ?  !  
 yknow what ?  forget it !  we are just hungry !  we have not had lunch !  we are just light - headed !  so let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake .  
good idea .  where do you want to go to lunch ?  
well ,  thank you for lunch .  
so apparently we just dont pay for food anymore .   do you see what i see ?  
mrs .  braverman must be out .   
by then ,  the cheesecake may have gone bad .  we dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake .  
well ,  we dont want that .  
but we should take it .  
why ?  
 hey !  
 what do you got there ?  
are you eating the cheesecake without me ?  !  
i will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now .   how can you eat the cheesecake without me ?  !  
yknow what ?  i dont trust you with this cake anymore !  and i got it first ,  and im takin it back !   
oh yes !  
oh yes !  
oh yes !  oh yes !  
well thats not fair ,  youve already had some !  
what do we use to split it ?  
 okay well ,  this side looks bigger .  uh theres more crust on this side .  yknow ?  so ,  maybe if i measured 
all right ,  ill pick that one .   
 ohhh !

good morning !  
what ?  
i wasn &apos;t checking her out .  i &apos;m in fashion ,  i was looking at her skirt .  or was it pants ?  i didn &apos;t really see what happened below the ass area .  
why do you even care if i was looking at her ?  are you jealous ?  
i thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant tag .  
huh .  what &apos;s tag &apos;s last name ?  
but it was a deap meaningful relationship .  
it was jones .  
i think it &apos;s sweet .   
why not ?  
gavin mitchelle &apos;s office .  
hey mom !  no ,  that &apos;s just my secretary .

you were just being so nice to him !  
i was faking it !  can &apos;t you tell when i &apos;m being fake ?   
right there !  that was so fake !  
oh ,  you &apos;re welcome for the party .  i &apos;m glad you &apos;re having a good time .  
does he ?  
maybe he &apos;s bothering you so much because he likes you .  it &apos;s like in first grade when skippy langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me ?  
 she &apos;s out ,  i &apos;m gonna take her home .  
hey rach ,  so can i sing happy birthday to you now ?  
hey rach ,  somebody got you shoes !  
yeah .  we have rat babies now .  
i had to bring them !  we killed their mother ,  they &apos;re our responsibility now .  you know ,  they require constant care .  you should know that ,  rachel ,  you &apos;re a mother .  
no !  seven rats !  i think we should take them home ,  we need feed them .  
hey !  
no way !  you had your party ,  now i have mine !  is everything alright ?  
well ,  at least you have one thing to be happy about .  that jerk gavin from your office didn &apos;t show up  .  
oh ,  we weren &apos;t talking about you .  no ,  no way to recover .  
nice party .  
look ,  i &apos;ll just give you this and go .  
well ,  let me explain how birthday parties usually work .  there are presents ,  and a cake ,  perhaps a fourth or fifth person .  ok ,  i  .  .  .  got you the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier .  
i really mean it .  
you don &apos;t mind ?   well ,  what do you know ,  it fits !  
i &apos;m not sure .  
i do have feelings for you .  
yes ,  i feel that you are a little annoying .  
i &apos;m there !  
well yes rachel but you got something so beautiful out there 
you kissed him ?  
oh yeah .  .  . so how did you end up kissing ?  
i thought you hated him ?  
so are you thinking of starting up something with this guy ?  
sounds like you need to think about what you want ,  talk to gavin ,  and you definitely should talk to ross 
gavin !  i brought you some soup .  
i heard you were sick .  .  .  
i missed you at work today .  how are you feeling ?  
oh !  good !  because i was having a totally paranoid moment when i thought you called in sick to avoid me .  
so i had fun last night 
exactly how contagious is this thing you have ?  i mean is it a cold for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you ?  
do you have fever ?  let me see .  hum .  .  .  
what &apos;s ross doing to you on that picture ?  
right .  right .  ross .  so what &apos;s the deal with you guys ?  i don &apos;t want to get in the middle of anything 
yeah !  but you said not to worry about .  .  .  
hi !  
no i &apos;m here to take emma to your mother &apos;s ,  remember ?  
don &apos;t panic !  
there is a man behind your curtain .  i have a mace in my purse .  
hello !  i just go and get emma .  
so hum .  .  . why did i have to hide ?  
so what if it was ?  i thought there was nothing going on between you two .  .  .  
you hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming out of a chute for the first time .  i used to be a rodeo clown .  
it &apos;s ok .  i know it &apos;s probably not my place but can i give you a piece of advice ?  
i think you should talk to ross about all this .  
don &apos;t be .  it &apos;s just bad timing .  
 .  good choice ross .  
oh ,  yeah ,  hello ,  well ,  now ,  here i am .  
oh ,  yeah ,  yeah thats michelle .  
oh ,  just this woman ive been seeing .  
how great is this ?  you are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff .  oh ,  i am sorry michelle ,  thats my roommate ,  rachel .  
ross ,  you didnt tell me you were a doctor !  
well see .  
i dont know ,  are we just kissing guys on balconies ?  
when i happened to look through the window and i see you kissing a guy you know ,  for what ?  a week ?  
you know ,  if its meant to be ,  ill guess it .  bye ,  bye .  
oh ,  i am sorry ,  did you not like her ,  because i was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on the balcony .  
oh ,  really !  
oh ,  really !  
what about the guy from the bar ?  
the guy you gave your number to .  
because he called here looking for you .  so dont tell me this .  .  . this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing ,  ok ?  youve been out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now .  and you didnt even have the courtesy to tell me .  
what ?  
because i folded it up and put in my pants pocket .  do you .  .  . do you not look there ?  
i never gave it to you .  
i dont know .  
who am i ?  
i am the guy whos taking care of our baby while youre out at bars meeting guys !  
none of the sane ones wanted to come back with me !  thats not the point .  ok ?  the point is you .  .  . you are the one who moved on and didnt tell anyone !  
uh ,  clearly .  
hey !  
ha ,  oh ,  of course .  
morning ,  roomie !  
fifth day &apos;s a charm .  
hey ,  you &apos;re not naked !  so hey ,  rach ,  when will we expect to see you tonight ?  
she &apos;s probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night .  
hey !  
see ,  now ,  why would you assume that ?  just because we &apos;re married ?  i will have you know that we are very hip ,  happening people .  now ,  if you &apos;ll excuse me ,  i have to get back to reading the obituaries .  
sure ,  we &apos;ll do that .  what are you up to ?  
wow .  
just figured ,   &apos;cause you and ross are .  .  .  
you want a job ?  turn off  &quot; oprah ,  &quot;  and send out a resume !  
oh ,  it &apos;s perfect .  
wow ,  everything looks so good !  i think i &apos;m gonna have the chicken .  to say this; you &apos;re really beautiful .  
i &apos;m kind of funny looking .  
i &apos;m not funny either .  so ,  if you were thinking ,   &quot; well ,  he &apos;s not that good - looking ,  but maybe we &apos;ll have some laughs &quot;  .  .  .  that ain &apos;t gonna happen .  
i silk - screen t - shirts now .  
i do like my hair .  
hello ?   
hey ,  rach !  
you know ,  you are talking about one of my dear ,  dear friends .  
oh ,  right ,  so he gets a little crazy when he &apos;s stoned .  
did he go out for a cigarette ?  
crying in front of you .  you must think i &apos;m so pathetic .  
really ?   
don &apos;t touch my coat !   
oh ,  sorry ,  it &apos;s my phone .  hello ?  
hey ,  did you stop by here ?  
oh ,  thank god !  emma ,  there you are !  
look ,  i think i know the answer to this question ,  but .  .  .  would you like to make love to me ?  
eh ,  it &apos;s just as well .  doesn &apos;t work anyway .  
hey ,  what &apos;s wrong ?  
oh .  crab cake ?  
well ,  what happened ?  
monica told me you had a blind date .  
i did ,  too .  
but is it technically a date if the other person doesn &apos;t show up ?  
why does everyone keep saying that ?  
that bad ?  
the first date we &apos;ve had in months ,  and they were both such disasters .  
 who did ?   
 she did ?  
i don &apos;t know ,  but it sounds great .  
with lennart haze ?  
well ,  it must be ,  because i read and i didn &apos;t understand a singe word .  
 he was so good in that movie of macbeth .  
yeah ,  he &apos;s done some amazing works .  
putting on the sneakers thought i &apos;d get into a younger mindset ,  you know ,  to see if it sparked anything 
yesterday at my audition ,  i really had to pee ,  and apparently ,  having to pee makes me a really good actor .  i got a call - back ,  so i &apos;m drinking everything .  oh ,  by the way ,  that egg nog in our fridge was great !  
 you know what these aren &apos;t half - bad !   you should suggest something like these to ralph lauren .  
that &apos;s right i am !   
oo .  .  . what &apos;s in the bag ?  
anyway erm ,  are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff ?  
you &apos;re gonna do it ?  
oh ,  women can .  you can &apos;t .  
you &apos;re a pig .  and you can &apos;t do this .  
the hardware store is right down the street .  
so you gave in and decided to call someone ?  
you &apos;re all set .   
hey rach !  there she is .  .  . my perfectly proportioned wife .  
i mean ,  you wouldn &apos;t want any part of me to get any bigger would you ?  don &apos;t answer that .   
i know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger ?  
oh my god .  we &apos;re trying to get pregnant so he &apos;s probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change .  
you heard him !   &quot; no bigger !  &quot;   &quot; you &apos;re perfect !  &quot;   &quot; just don &apos;t get any bigger !  &quot;  oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach .  you know what ?  i &apos;m going to have to talk to chandler .

rachel .  .  .  let &apos;s be clear on this ,  ok ?  i do not love hugsy .  i like him a normal amount .  .  .

look forget it forget it .  .  .  i can &apos;t do it .  
oh well ,  the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don &apos;t sell tickets here in new york ,  so .  .  .

let me think .  oh ,  when i was younger i used to dream that i got married to mayor mccheese ,  and on our wedding night i ate his head .  
wow ,  do you mean like kiss him - kiss him ?  
what do you think brought than on ?  
a love scene ?  with who ?  
olivia ?  i thought she was marrying connor !   oh right ,  real life more important .  
i don &apos;t know .  i mean ,  you saw him do a love scene ,  so maybe you don &apos;t have a thing for joey ,  maybe you have a thing for drake .  
of course it was !  trust me ,  when it comes to psychology i know what i &apos;m talking about .  i took two psych classes in college .  
oh ,  ok .  fine ,  i &apos;ll just ,  i &apos;ll take the hat back  .   
my songs aren &apos;t good enough for your restaurant ?  
hey !  
 oh man !  i thought i got it all !  
i was making a peanut butter smoothy ,  right ?  
and i couldn &apos;t find this little plastic thing  that goes on top of the blender .  .  . and i thought .  .  . well .  .  .  how important can that be ,  right .  .  .  ?  turns out very !  
what ?  
oh .  .  . i don &apos;t think it &apos;s going very well .  .  .  
well ,  i &apos;m feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow .  .  .  
a little .  yeah no ,  i really am worried ,  you know ,  i mean i have to make it convincing that i &apos;m in love with olivia .  
so .  .  . i &apos;ve never played that !  
uh .  .  . well .  .  . just once .  .  . with you .  .  .  
 what the hell are you talking about ?  ?  
 oh !  ok ,  yeah ,  i think i can do that .  yeah ok ,  there &apos;s this party scene coming up .  .  and olivia and her husband are there and all drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her ,  but he can &apos;t .  .  .  and that makes me think about all those times when i wanted to grab you and kiss you ,  but you didn &apos;t know so i would just pretend everything was cool ,  but really ,  it was killing me .  
 uh ,  let &apos;s see ,  who do i hate ?  
 hey ,  here you go .

ooh !  well played ,  phoebe buffay ,  well played .

what &apos;s up ?  
what ?   
oh ,  i don &apos;t wanna choose !  it &apos;s  .  oh okay ,  wait .  rach !  listen i have a very special bridesmaid task for you today .  
well ,  there &apos;s a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between ross and chandler .  so good luck with that .  
hey !  
oh ,  happy my wedding day to you !  
i have to talk to her about this groomsman situation ,  ok ?  i &apos;m not gonna watch chandler up there while i &apos;m sitting in the seats like some chump !   .   oh !  my god !  you &apos;re breathtaking !  
you haven &apos;t by any chance chosen a groomsman yet ,  have you ?  
i &apos;m not !  i &apos;m making it easier !  pick me !  
listen ,  listen .  whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you !  now ,  i promise i won &apos;t say a word ,  but if you pick chandler he &apos;s gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time !  
hey ,  can i talk to you about this groomsman thing ?  if you pick ross ,  he &apos;ll walk you down the isle just fine .  but if you choose me ,  you &apos;ll be getting some comedy !  
let me tell you why you need to pick me .   see ,  when i was a kid ,  i was always left out of everything ,  you know ,  and it really made me feel .  .  .  insecure .  you know ,  i was always picked last in gym .  even behind that big fat exchange student who didn &apos;t even know the rules to baseball .  i mean ,  this guy would strike out and then run to third .  anyway ,  if i &apos;m the only one left out of this wedding ,  i just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back .  
 y - y - yeeesss !  make  &quot; groom &quot;  for chandler .  
you told us both we could be in the wedding ?
