well ,  i was kinda supposed to be headed for aruba on my honeymoon ,  so nothing !  
right ,  you &apos;re not even getting your honeymoon ,  god .  .  no ,  no ,  although ,  aruba ,  this time of year .  .  .  talk about your -    - big lizards .  .  .  anyway ,  if you don &apos;t feel like being alone tonight ,  joey and chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture .  
 yes ,  and we &apos;re very excited about it .  
well actually thanks ,  but i think i &apos;m just gonna hang out here tonight .  it &apos;s been kinda a long day .  
okay ,  sure .  
hey pheebs ,  you wanna help ?  
 i &apos;m supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things ,  using a bunch of these little worm guys .  i have no brackety thing ,  i see no whim guys whatsoever and -  i cannot feel my legs .   
i &apos;m thinking we &apos;ve got a bookcase here .  
it &apos;s a beautiful thing .  
 what &apos;s this ?  
i would have to say that is an  &apos;l &apos; - shaped bracket .  
which goes where ?  
i have no idea .   
done with the bookcase !  
all finished !  
 this was carol &apos;s favorite beer .  she always drank it out of the can ,  i should have known .  
hey - hey - hey - hey ,  if you &apos;re gonna start with that stuff we &apos;re outta here .  
yes ,  please don &apos;t spoil all this fun .  
ross ,  let me ask you a question .  she got the furniture ,  the stereo ,  the good tv -  what did you get ?  
you guys .  
oh ,  god .  
you got screwed .  
oh my god !  
i know ,  i know ,  i &apos;m such an idiot .  i guess i should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week .  i mean ,  how clean can teeth get ?  
my brother &apos;s going through that right now ,  he &apos;s such a mess .  how did you get through it ?  
well ,  you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers ,  say her -  
 - leg ?  
 that &apos;s one way !  me ,  i -  i went for the watch .  
you actually broke her watch ?  wow !  the worst thing i ever did was ,  i - i shredded by boyfriend &apos;s favorite bath towel .  
ooh ,  steer clear of you .  
i &apos;m divorced !  i &apos;m only 26 and i &apos;m divorced !  
shut up !  
you must stop !   
that only took me an hour .  
look ,  ross ,  you gotta understand ,  between us we haven &apos;t had a relationship that has lasted longer than a mento .  you ,  however have had the love of a woman for four years .  four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out ,  and that is why we don &apos;t do it !  i don &apos;t think that was my point !  
you know what the scariest part is ?  what if there &apos;s only one woman for everybody ,  y &apos;know ?  i mean what if you get one woman -  and that &apos;s it ?  unfortunately in my case ,  there was only one woman -  for her .  .  .  
what are you talking about ?   &apos;one woman &apos; ?  that &apos;s like saying there &apos;s only one flavor of ice cream for you .  lemme tell you something ,  ross .  there &apos;s lots of flavors out there .  there &apos;s rocky road ,  and cookie dough ,  and bing !  cherry vanilla .  you could get  &apos;em with jimmies ,  or nuts ,  or whipped cream !  this is the best thing that ever happened to you !  you got married ,  you were ,  like ,  what ,  eight ?  welcome back to the world !  grab a spoon !  
i honestly don &apos;t know if i &apos;m hungry or horny .  
stay out of my freezer !   
ever since she walked out on me ,  i ,  uh .  .  .  
what ?  .  .  .  .  .  what ,  you wanna spell it out with noodles ?  
no ,  it &apos;s ,  it &apos;s more of a fifth date kinda revelation .  
oh ,  so there is gonna be a fifth date ?  
isn &apos;t there ?  
yeah .  .  .  yeah ,  i think there is .   - what were you gonna say ?  
well ,  ever - ev -  .  .  .  ever since she left me ,  um ,  i haven &apos;t been able to ,  uh ,  perform .    .  .  . sexually .  
 oh god ,  oh god ,  i am sorry .  .  .  i am so sorry .  .  .  
it &apos;s okay .  .  .  
i know being spit on is probably not what you need right now .  um .  .  .  how long ?  
two years .  
wow !  i &apos;m - i &apos;m - i &apos;m glad you smashed her watch !  
so you still think you ,  um .  .  .  might want that fifth date ?
