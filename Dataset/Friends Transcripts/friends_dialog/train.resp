<joey> which goes where ?  
<chandler> i have no idea .   
<joey> done with the bookcase !  
<chandler> all finished !

<ross> you guys .  
<chandler> oh ,  god .  
<joey> you got screwed .  
<chandler> oh my god !  
<s> i know ,  i know ,  i &apos;m such an idiot .  i guess i should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week .  i mean ,  how clean can teeth get ?  
<monica> my brother &apos;s going through that right now ,  he &apos;s such a mess .  how did you get through it ?  
<s> well ,  you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers ,  say her -  
<monica>  - leg ?

<s> ooh ,  steer clear of you .  
<monica> that &apos;s right .  
<joey> shut up !  
<chandler> you must stop !   
<ross> that only took me an hour .  
<chandler> look ,  ross ,  you gotta understand ,  between us we haven &apos;t had a relationship that has lasted longer than a mento .  you ,  however have had the love of a woman for four years .  four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out ,  and that is why we don &apos;t do it !  i don &apos;t think that was my point !  
<ross> you know what the scariest part is ?  what if there &apos;s only one woman for everybody ,  y &apos;know ?  i mean what if you get one woman -  and that &apos;s it ?  unfortunately in my case ,  there was only one woman -  for her .  .  .  
<joey> what are you talking about ?   &apos;one woman &apos; ?  that &apos;s like saying there &apos;s only one flavor of ice cream for you .  lemme tell you something ,  ross .  there &apos;s lots of flavors out there .  there &apos;s rocky road ,  and cookie dough ,  and bing !  cherry vanilla .  you could get  &apos;em with jimmies ,  or nuts ,  or whipped cream !  this is the best thing that ever happened to you !  you got married ,  you were ,  like ,  what ,  eight ?  welcome back to the world !  grab a spoon !  
<ross> i honestly don &apos;t know if i &apos;m hungry or horny .  
<chandler> stay out of my freezer !   
<s> ever since she walked out on me ,  i ,  uh .  .  .
