< 
<monica> there's nothing to tell! he's just some guy i work with! 
<joey> c'mon, you're going out with the guy! there's gotta be something wrong with him! 
<chandler> all right joey, be nice.  so does he have a hump? a hump and a hairpiece? 
<phoebe> wait, does he eat chalk?  
<phoebe> just, 'cause, i don't want her to go through what i went through with carl- oh! 
<monica> okay, everybody relax. this is not even a date. it's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex. 
<chandler> sounds like a date to me. 
<chandler> alright, so i'm back in high school, i'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and i realize i am totally naked. 
<s> oh, yeah. had that dream. 
<chandler> then i look down, and i realize there's a phone... there. 
<joey> instead of...? 
<chandler> that's right. 
<joey> never had that dream. 
<phoebe> no. 
<chandler> all of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. now i don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. 
<monica> and they weren't looking at you before?! 
<chandler> finally, i figure i'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me! 
<ross>  hi. 
<joey> this guy says hello, i wanna kill myself. 
<monica> are you okay, sweetie? 
<ross> i just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck... 
<chandler> cookie? 
<monica>  carol moved her stuff out today. 
<joey> ohh. 
<monica>  let me get you some coffee. 
<ross> thanks. 
<phoebe> ooh! oh!  
<ross> no, no don't! stop cleansing my aura! no, just leave my aura alone, okay? 
<phoebe> fine!  be murky! 
<ross> i'll be fine, alright? really, everyone. i hope she'll be very happy. 
<monica> no you don't. 
<ross> no i don't, to hell with her, she left me! 
<joey> and you never knew she was a lesbian... 
<ross> no!! okay?! why does everyone keep fixating on that? she didn't know, how should i know? 
<chandler> sometimes i wish i was a lesbian...  did i say that out loud? 
<ross> i told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well. 
<monica> oh really, so that hysterical phone call i got from a woman at sobbing a.m., "i'll never have grandchildren, i'll never have grandchildren." was what?  a wrong number? 
<ross> sorry. 
<joey> alright ross, look. you're feeling a lot of pain right now. you're angry. you're hurting. can i tell you what the answer is?  
<joey> strip joint! c'mon, you're single! have some hormones! 
<ross> i don't want to be single, okay? i just... i just- i just wanna be married again!  
<chandler> and i just want a million dollars!  
<monica> rachel?! 
<rachel> oh god monica hi! thank god! i just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are! 
<s> can i get you some coffee? 
<monica>  de-caff.  okay, everybody, this is rachel, another lincoln high survivor.  this is everybody, this is chandler, and phoebe, and joey, and- you remember my brother ross? 
<rachel> hi, sure! 
<ross> hi.  
<monica> so you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids? 
<rachel> oh god... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. i was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and i was looking at this gravy boat. this really gorgeous lamauge gravy boat. when all of a sudden- sweet 'n' lo?- i realized that i was more turned on by this gravy boat than by barry! and then i got really freaked out, and that's when it familiar, but... anyway, i just had to get out of there, and i started wondering 'why am i doing this, and who am i doing this for?'.  so anyway i just didn't know where to go, and i know that you and i have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person i knew who lived here in the city. 
<monica> who wasn't invited to the wedding. 
<rachel> ooh, i was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an and are trying to figure out what is going on.] 
<monica> now i'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. 
<chandler>  tuna or egg salad?  decide! 
<ross>  i'll have whatever christine is having. 
<rachel>  daddy, i just... i can't marry him! i'm sorry. i just don't love him. well, it matters to me!  
<phoebe>  if i let go of my hair, my head will fall off. 
<chandler>  ooh, she should not be wearing those pants. 
<joey> i say push her down the stairs. push her down the stairs! push her down the stairs! push her down the stairs!  
<rachel> c'mon daddy, listen to me! it's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'you're a shoe! you're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. and today i just stopped and i said, 'what if i don't wanna be a shoe? what if i wanna be a- a purse, y'know? or a- or a hat! no, i'm not saying i want you to buy me a hat, i'm saying i am a ha- it's a metaphor, daddy! 
<ross> you can see where he'd have trouble. 
<rachel> look daddy, it's my life. well maybe i'll just stay here with monica. 
<monica> well, i guess we've established who's staying here with monica... 
<rachel> well, maybe that's my decision. well, maybe i don't need your money. wait!! wait, i said maybe!! 
<monica> just breathe, breathe.. that's it. just try to think of nice calm things... 
<phoebe>  raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens,  bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... la la la la...something and noodles with string.  these are a few... 
<rachel> i'm all better now. 
<phoebe>  i helped! 
<monica> okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? independence. taking control of your life.  the whole, 'hat' thing. 
<joey>  and hey, you need anything, you can always come to joey. me and chandler live across the hall. and he's away a lot. 
<monica> joey, stop hitting on her! it's her wedding day! 
<joey> what, like there's a rule or something?  
<chandler> please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.

<ross>  that'd be good... 
<monica>  really?

<phoebe> what does that mean? does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?   
<monica> hi, come in! paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is paul. 
<s> hey! paul! hi! the wine guy! hey!

<phoebe> ooh, i just pulled out four eyelashes. that can't be good.  
<joey>  hey, paul! 
<s> yeah? 
<joey> here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red. 
<monica>  shut up, joey! 
<ross> so rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight? 
<rachel> well, i was kinda supposed to be headed for aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing! 
<ross> right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, god.. no, no, although, aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, joey and chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture. 
<chandler>  yes, and we're very excited about it. 
<rachel> well actually thanks, but i think i'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  it's been kinda a long day.

< 
<ross>  i'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. i have no brackety thing, i see no whim guys whatsoever and- i cannot feel my legs.  
<joey> i'm thinking we've got a bookcase here. 
<chandler> it's a beautiful thing. 
<joey>  what's this? 
<chandler> i would have to say that is an 'l'-shaped bracket. 
<joey> which goes where? 
<chandler> i have no idea.  
<joey> done with the bookcase! 
<chandler> all finished! 
<ross>  this was carol's favorite beer. she always drank it out of the can, i should have known. 
<joey> hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here. 
<chandler> yes, please don't spoil all this fun. 
<joey> ross, let me ask you a question. she got the furniture, the stereo, the good tv- what did you get? 
<ross> you guys. 
<chandler> oh, god. 
<joey> you got screwed. 
<chandler> oh my god! 
< 
<monica> oh my god! 
<s> i know, i know, i'm such an idiot. i guess i should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. i mean, how clean can teeth get? 
<monica> my brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. how did you get through it? 
<s> well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her- 
<monica> -leg? 
<s>  that's one way! me, i- i went for the watch. 
<monica> you actually broke her watch?  wow!  the worst thing i ever did was, i-i shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel. 
<s> ooh, steer clear of you. 
<monica> that's right. 
< 
<rachel> barry, i'm sorry... i am so sorry... i know you probably think that this is all about what i said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and i ju-  hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, i know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become mrs. barry finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me.  and not that i have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too...  
< 
<ross> i'm divorced!  i'm only 26 and i'm divorced! 
<joey> shut up! 
<chandler> you must stop!  
<ross> that only took me an hour. 
<chandler> look, ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a mento. you, however have had the love of a woman for four years. four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  i don't think that was my point! 
<ross> you know what the scariest part is? what if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? i mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her... 
<joey> what are you talking about? 'one woman'? that's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. lemme tell you something, ross. there's lots of flavors out there. there's rocky road, and cookie dough, and bing! cherry vanilla. you could get 'em with jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! this is the best thing that ever happened to you! you got married, you were, like, what, eight? welcome back to the world! grab a spoon! 
<ross> i honestly don't know if i'm hungry or horny. 
<chandler> stay out of my freezer!  
<s> ever since she walked out on me, i, uh... 
<monica> what?..... what, you wanna spell it out with noodles? 
<s> no, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation. 
<monica> oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date? 
<s> isn't there? 
<monica> yeah... yeah, i think there is. -what were you gonna say? 
<s> well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, i haven't been able to, uh, perform.  ...sexually. 
<monica>  oh god, oh god, i am sorry... i am so sorry... 
<s> it's okay... 
<monica> i know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. um... how long? 
<s> two years. 
<monica> wow! i'm-i'm-i'm glad you smashed her watch! 
<s> so you still think you, um... might want that fifth date? 
<monica> ...yeah. yeah, i do.

<rachel> oh...see... but joanne loved chachi! that's the difference!

<ross>  grab a spoon. do you know how long it's been since i've grabbed a spoon? do the words 'billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you? 
<joey> great story!  but, i uh, i gotta go, i got a date with andrea--angela--andrea...  oh man,  
<chandler> angela's the screamer, andrea has cats. 
<joey> right.  thanks. it's june.  i'm outta here.

<rachel> isn't this amazing? i mean, i have never made coffee before in my entire life. 
<chandler> that is amazing. 
<joey> congratulations. 
<rachel> y'know, i figure if i can make coffee, there isn't anything i can't do. 
<chandler> if can invade poland, there isn't anything i can't do. 
<joey> listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a western omelet or something...  although actually i'm really not that hungry...

<joey> look, it was a job all right? 
<chandler> 'look, gippetto, i'm a real live boy.' 
<joey> i will not take this abuse.  
<chandler> you're right, i'm sorry.  "once i was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..." 
<joey> you should both know, that he's a dead man.  oh, chandler?  
<monica> so how you doing today? did you sleep okay? talk to barry? i can't stop smiling. 
<rachel> i can see that. you look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth. 
<monica> i know, he's just so, so... do you remember you and tony demarco? 
<rachel> oh, yeah. 
<monica> well, it's like that. with feelings.

< 
<joey> of course it was a line! 
<monica> why?! why? why, why would anybody do something like that? 
<ross> i assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'. 
<monica> i hate men!  i hate men! 
<phoebe> oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe. 
<monica> is it me? is it like i have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? 
<phoebe> all right, c'mere, gimme your feet.  
<monica> i just thought he was nice, y'know? 
<joey>  i can't believe you didn't know it was a line!

<ross> you got a job? 
<rachel> are you kidding? i'm trained for nothing! i was laughed out of twelve interviews today.

<rachel> um... my... father. 
< 
<rachel> oh god, come on you guys, is this really necessary?  i mean, i can stop charging anytime i want. 
<monica> c'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life. 
<rachel> i know that. that's why i was getting married. 
<phoebe> give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time. 
<rachel> thank you. 
<phoebe> you're welcome. i remember when i first came to this city. i was fourteen. my mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and i got here, and i didn't know anybody. and i ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then i found aromatherapy. so believe me, i know exactly how you feel.  
<ross> the word you're looking for is 'anyway'... 
<monica> all right, you ready? 
<rachel> no.  no, no, i'm not ready!  how can i be ready?  "hey, rach!  you ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?"  come on, i can't do this! 
<monica> you can, i know you can!

<rachel> okay. 
<ross> okay.  you know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, i had a, um, major crush on you. 
<rachel> i knew. 
<ross> you did! oh.... i always figured you just thought i was monica's geeky older brother. 
<rachel> i did. 
<ross> oh. listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if i asked you out? sometime? maybe? 
<rachel> yeah, maybe...

<monica> what you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
<joey> yeah, right!.......y'serious? 
<phoebe> oh, yeah! 
<rachel> everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
<monica> absolutely. 
<chandler> yeah, i think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? i mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before pink floyd comes out. 
<ross> yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
<chandler> the problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? i mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
<rachel> yeah, well, word of advice you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone. 
<joey> ....are we still talking about sex? opening credits 
< 
<ross> no, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?

<phoebe>...then i've already seen this one!  
<monica>  are you through with that? 
<joey> yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
<monica> whose little ball of paper is this?! 
<chandler> oh, uh, that would be mine. see, i wrote a note to myself, and then i realised i didn't need it, so i balled it up and...  ...now i wish i was dead.  
<phoebe> she's already fluffed that pillow... monica, you know, you've already fluffed that-  -but, it's fine! 
<monica> look , i'm sorry, guys, i just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
<chandler> yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. 
<phoebe> monica- hi! um, monica, you're scaring me. i mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. and not-not in a good way. 
<joey> yeah, calm down. you don't see ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
<monica> that's because as far as my parents are concerned, ross can do no wrong. y'see, he's the prince. apparently they had some big ceremony before i was born.

<ross> .....hi. 
<monica> wow. that is not a happy hi. 
<ross> carol's pregnant. 
<phoebe>  ooh! i found it! 
<monica> w-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
<ross> yeah. do that for another two hours, you might be where i am right about now.  
<chandler> kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, mon? 
<rachel> well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
<ross> well, carol says she and susan want me to be involved, but if i'm not comfortable with it, i don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
<phoebe> she is so great! i miss her. 
<monica> what does she mean by 'involved'? 
<chandler> i mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
<ross> anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
<rachel> so what are you gonna do? 
<ross> i have no idea. no matter what i do, though, i'm still gonna be a father.  
<joey> .....well, this is still ruined, right?  
<s> oh, martha ludwin's daughter is gonna call you.  mmm! what's that curry taste? 
<monica> curry. 
<s> mmmm! 
<ross> i- i think they're great! i, i really do. 
<s>  do you remember the ludwins? the big one had a thing for you, didn't she? 
<s> they all had a thing for him. 
<ross> aw, mom... 
<monica> i'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
<s> oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... i don't know. anyway, i told her you had a restaurant- 
<monica> no mom, i don't have a restaurant, i work in a restaurant. 
<s> well, they don't have to know that...  
<monica> ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
<ross> yeah.  
<s> oh, we're having spaghetti! that's.... easy. 
<monica> i know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? because i think it might take some of the heat off me. 
<s> what that rachel did to her life.... we ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well. 
<s> i'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money! 
<s> well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
<monica> what's that supposed to mean? 
<s> nothing! it's an expression. 
<monica> no it's not. 
<s> don't listen to your mother. you're independent, and you always have been! even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! and you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles... 
<s> look, there are people like ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. other people are satisfied with staying where they are- i'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer. 
<s> ...and i read about these women trying to have it all, and i thank god 'our little harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
<monica>  so, ross, what's going on with you? any stories?  no news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
<ross>  okay! okay.  look, i, uh- i realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. carol's a lesbian. she's living with a woman named susan. she's pregnant with my child, and she and susan are going to raise the baby.  
<s>  and you knew about this?! commercial break 
< 
<joey> your folks are really that bad, huh? 
<ross> well, y'know, these people are pros. they know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
<monica> boy, i know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could-  -i'd want yours. 
<ross> must pee.  
<phoebe> y'know, it's even worse when you're twins. 
<rachel> you're twins? 
<phoebe> yeah. we don't speak. she's like this high-powered, driven career type. 
<chandler> what does she do? 
<phoebe> she's a waitress. 
<rachel> all right, you guys, i kinda gotta clean up now.  
<monica> chandler, you're an only child, right? you don't have any of this. 
<chandler> well, no, although i did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
<rachel> the lights, please..  
<ross> ...how long was i in there? 
<rachel> i'm just cleaning up. 
<ross> d'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?

<rachel> oh.. a little.. 
<ross> mm-hmm.. 
<rachel> a lot. 
<ross> mm. 
<rachel> so, got any advice? y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
<ross> well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, i know it'll be hard. or, y'know, uh, hey!, i'll go down there, and i'll give barry back his ring, and you can go with carol and susan to the ob/gyn... 
<rachel> oh, you've got carol tomorrow.. when did it get so complicated? 
<ross> got me. 
<rachel> remember when we were in high school together? 
<ross> yeah. 
<rachel> i mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it?  ..ross? 
<ross> yes, yes! 
<rachel> oh! man, i never thought i'd be here..  
<ross> me either...

<s> hello? it's not gonna be helen geller. 
<ross> thank you! 
<s> no, i mean it's not geller. 
<ross> what, it's gonna be helen willick? 
<s> no, actually, um, we talked about helen willick-bunch. 
<ross> well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
<s> it's my baby too. 
<ross> oh, 's'funny, really? um, i don't remember you making any sperm. 
<s> yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is! 
<s> all right, you two, stop it! 
<ross> no no no, she gets a credit, hey, i'm in there too. 
<s> ross. you're not actually suggesting helen willick-bunch-geller? 'cause i think that borders on child abuse. 
<ross> of course not, i'm... suggesting geller-willick-bunch. 
<s> oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? he knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her geller, then he gets his way! 
<ross> my way?! you-you think this is my way? believe me, of all the ways i ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? uh, um, this is too hard. i'm not, i can't do- 
<s> yeah. yeah. a little. sharing.  uh, lie back.. 
<ross> you- uh- y'know what, i'm gonna go. i don't- i don't think i can be involved in this particular thing right now.  
<ross> oh my god. 
<s> look at that. 
<s> i know. closing credits 
< 
<ross> well? isn't that amazing? 
<joey> what are we supposed to be seeing here? 
<chandler> i dunno, but.. i think it's about to attack the enterprise. 
<phoebe> you know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
<ross> then don't do that, alright? 
<phoebe> okay! 
<ross> monica. whaddya think? 
<monica>  mm-hmm. 
<ross> wh- are you welling up? 
<monica> no. 
<ross> you are, you're welling up. 
<monica> am not! 
<ross> you're gonna be an aunt. 
<monica>  oh shut up! 
<rachel>  hi, mindy. hi, it-it's rachel. yeah, i'm fine. i-i saw barry today. oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. no, no, it's okay. i hope you two are very happy, i really do. oh, oh, and mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- i just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose.  okay, i know it was a cheap shot, 
< 
<phoebe>  hi guys! 
<s> hey, pheebs! hi! 
<ross> hey. oh, oh, how'd it go? 
<phoebe> um, not so good. he walked me to the subway and said 'we should do this again!' 
<s> ohh. ouch. 
<rachel> what? he said 'we should do it again', that's good, right? 
<monica> uh, no. loosely translated 'we should do this again' means 'you will never see me naked'. 
<rachel> since when? 
<joey> since always. it's like dating language. y'know, like 'it's not you' means 'it is you'. 
<chandler> or 'you're such a nice guy' means 'i'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'. 
<phoebe> or, or, y'know, um, 'i think we should see other people' means 'ha, ha, i already am'. 
<rachel> and everybody knows this? 
<joey> yeah. cushions the blow. 
<chandler> yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. 
<ross> that's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm. 
<monica> uh, ross. 
<ross> what? wh- hello? the millners' farm in connecticut? the millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....oh my god, chi chi! opening credits 
< 
<chandler> "so how does it feel knowing you're about to die?" 
<joey> "warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. but you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die." 
<chandler> hey, that was really good! 
<joey> thanks! let's keep going. 
<chandler> okay. "so. whaddya want from me, damone, huh?" 
<joey> "i just wanna go back to my cell. 'cause in my cell, i can smoke." 
<chandler> "smoke away."  
<chandler> i think this is probably why damone smokes in his cell alone. 
<joey> what? 
<chandler> relax your hand!  
<chandler> not so much! 
<joey> whoah! 
<chandler> hey! 
<joey> hey! 
<chandler> alright, now try taking a puff.  
<chandler> alright.. okay. no. give it to me. 
<joey> no no no, i am not giving you a cigarette. 
<chandler> it's fine, it's fine. look, do you wanna get this part, or not? here.  
<chandler> don't think of it as a cigarette. think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. when you're holding it, you feel right. you feel complete. 
<joey> y'miss it? 
<chandler> nah, not so much. alright, now we smoke.  oh.. my.. god.   
<monica> no, no, no. they say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.  
<joey> that's ridiculous! 
<ross> can i use.. either thumb? 
<rachel>  alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!  decaf cappucino for joey.. coffee black.. late.. and an iced tea. i'm getting pretty good at this! 
<s> yeah. yeah, excellent. 
<rachel>  good for me!  
<joey> y'okay, phoebe? 
<phoebe> yeah- no- i'm just- it's, i haven't worked- it's my bank. 
<monica> what did they do to you? 
<phoebe> it's nothing, it's just- okay. i'm going through my mail, and i open up their monthly, you know, statement- 
<ross> easy. 
<phoebe> - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account. 
<chandler> oh, satan's minions at work again... 
<phoebe> yes, 'cause now i have to go down there, and deal with them. 
<joey> what are you talking about? keep it! 
<phoebe> it's not mine, i didn't earn it, if i kept it, it would be like stealing. 
<rachel> yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping! 
<phoebe> okay. okay, let's say i bought a really great pair of shoes. do you know what i'd hear, with every step i took? 'not-mine. not-mine. not-mine.' and even if i was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'... 
<monica> we're with you. we got it.  
<phoebe> okay. i'd- just- i'd never be able to enjoy it. it would be like this giant karmic debt. 
<rachel> chandler, what are you doing? 
<monica>  hey. whaddya doing?  
<s> oh! oh, god! 
<ross> what is this?! 
<chandler> i'm smoking. i'm smoking, i'm smoking. 
<phoebe> oh, i can't believe you! you've been so good, for three years! 
<chandler> and this- is my reward! 
<ross> hold on a second, alright? just think about what you went through the last time you quit. 
<chandler> okay, so this time i won't quit! 
<s> ohhh! put it out! 
<chandler> all right! i'm putting it out, i'm putting it out.  
<phoebe> oh, no! i- i can't drink this now! 
<monica> alright. i'm gonna go change, i've got a date. 
<rachel> this alan again? how's it goin'? 
<monica> 's'going pretty good, y'know? it's nice, and, we're having fun. 
<joey> so when do we get to meet the guy? 
<monica> let's see, today's monday... never. 
<s> oh, come on! come on! 
<monica> no. not after what happened with steve. 
<chandler> what are you talking about? we love schhteve! schhteve was schhexy!.. sorry. 
<monica> look, i don't even know how i feel about him yet. just give me a chance to figure that out. 
<rachel> well, then can we meet him? 
<monica> nope. schhorry. 
< 
<monica> i mean, why should i let them meet him? i mean, i bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. i mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd. 
<s> listen. as someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, i'll looking out after you. 
<monica> i know. i just wish that once, i'd bring a guy home that they actually liked. 
<s> well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy.. 
< 
<joey> let it go, ross. 
<ross> yeah, well, you didn't know chi chi. 
<monica> do you all promise? 
<s> yeah! we promise! we'll be good! 
<monica>  chandler? do you promise to be good?  
<joey> you can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!   
<ross> hey, pheebs. 
<phoebe> 'dear ms. buffay. thank you for calling attention to our error. we have credited your account with five hundred dollars. we're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this-  -football phone as our free gift.' do you believe this?! now i have a thousand dollars, and a football phone! 
<rachel> what bank is this?  
<monica> hey. it's him.  who is it? 
<s>  it's alan. 
<joey>  chandler! he's here!  
<monica>  okay, please be good, please. just remember how much you all like me.  
<monica> hi. alan, this is everybody. everybody, this is alan. 
<s> hi. 
<s> hi, alan. 
<s> i've heard schho much about all you guyschh!  
<monica>  thanks. i'll call you tomorrow.  okay. okay, let's let the alan-bashing begin. who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?  
<monica> c'mon! 
<ross> ...i'll go. let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, i'm sorry, i can't do this, can't do this. we loved him. 
<s> loved him! yeah! he's great! 
<monica> wait a minute! we're talking about someone that i'm going out with? 
<s> yeah! 
<rachel> and did you notice...?  
<s>  yeah. 
<joey> know what was great? the way his smile was kinda crooked. 
<phoebe> yes, yes! like the man in the shoe! 
<ross> ...what shoe? 
<phoebe> from the nursery rhyme. 'there was a crooked man, who had a crooked smile, who lived in a shoe, for a... while...'  
<ross> ...so i think alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured. 
<rachel> what future boyfriends? nono, i th- i think this could be, y'know, it. 
<monica> really! 
<chandler> oh, yeah. i'd marry him just for his david hasselhof impression alone. you know i'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?  
<ross> you know what i like most about him, though? 
<s> what? 
<ross> the way he makes me feel about myself. 
<s> yeah... commercial break 
< 
<monica> hi.. how was the game? 
<ross> well.. 
<s> we won!! thank you! yes! 
<monica> fantastic! i have one question 
<joey> alan. 
<ross> he was unbelievable. he was like that-that-that bugs bunny cartoon where bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of bugs it was first base-alan, second base-alan, third base-... 
<rachel> i mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team. 
<chandler> yep, we sure showed those hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.. 
<monica> can i ask you guys a question? d'you ever think that alan is maybe.. sometimes.. 
<ross> what? 
<monica> ..i dunno, a little too alan? 
<rachel> well, no. that's impossible. you can never be too alan. 
<ross> yeah, it's his, uh, innate alan-ness that-that-that we adore. 
<chandler> i personally could have a gallon of alan. 
< 
<phoebe> hey, lizzie. 
<s> hey, weird girl. 
<phoebe> i brought you alphabet soup. 
<s> did you pick out the vowels? 
<phoebe> yes. but i left in the ys. 'cause, y'know, "sometimes y". uh, i also have something else for you.  
<s> saltines? 
<phoebe> no, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone? 
<s> what?  oh my god, there's really money in here. 
<phoebe> i know. 
<s> weird girl, what are you doing? 
<phoebe> no, i want you to have it. i don't want it. 
<s> no, no, i ha-i have to give you something. 
<phoebe> oh, that's fine, no. 
<s> would you like my tin-foil hat? 
<phoebe> no. 'cause you need that. no, it's okay, thanks. 
<s> please, let me do something. 
<phoebe> okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. okay? 
<s> okay. 
<phoebe> okay. 
< 
< 
<s> keep the change.  sure you don't wanna pretzel? 
<phoebe> no, i'm fine. 
<s>  see ya.  
<phoebe> huh! 
< 
<ross> a thumb?!  
<s> eww! 
<phoebe> i know! i know, i opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker! 
<chandler> well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? like, collect all five? 
<phoebe> does, um, anyone wanna see? 
<s> nooo!  
<s> oh, hey, don't do that! cut it out! 
<rachel> it's worse than the thumb! 
<chandler> hey, this is so unfair! 
<monica> oh, why is it unfair? 
<chandler> so i have a flaw! big deal! like joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? and ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? and monica, with that snort when she laughs? i mean, what the hell is that thing? ...i accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?  
<joey> ...does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody? 
<rachel> well, i-i could live without it. 
<joey> well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when phoebe chews her hair?  
<ross> oh, now, don't listen to him, pheebs, i think it's endearing. 
<joey> oh,  "you do, do you"?  
<ross> you know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. 
<rachel> "indeed there isn't"... i should really get back to work. 
<phoebe> yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered. 
<rachel> ohh-ho-hooohhh. the hair comes out, and the gloves come on.  
< 
<monica> did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like? 
<s> no. 
<monica> okay.. well, i'm going out with a guy my friends all really like. 
<s> waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? all right, a cow got through! 
<monica> can you believe it? ...y'know what? i just don't feel the thing. i mean, they feel the thing, i don't feel the thing. 
<s> honey.. you should always feel the thing. listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, monica, dump him! 
<monica> i know.. it's gonna be really hard. 
<s> well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it. 
<monica> no, he'll be fine. it's the other five i'm worried about. 
< 
<joey> do you have any respect for your body? 
<ross> don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself? 
<chandler> hey, y'know, i have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. the bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it. 
<rachel>  chandler? it's alan, he wants to speak to you. 
<chandler> really? he does?  hey, buddy, what's up! oh, she told you about that, huh. well, yeah, i have one now and then. well, yeah, now. well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. well, okay, thanks!  
<rachel>  god, he's good. 
<ross> if only he were a woman. 
<rachel> yeah.  
< 
<chandler> ooh, lambchop. how old is that sock? if i had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too. 
<ross> okay. i think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.  
<monica>  hey. where's joey? 
<chandler> joey ate my last stick of gum, so i killed him. do you think that was wrong? 
<rachel> i think he's across the hall. 
<monica> thanks.  
<ross>  there y'go. 
<chandler>  ooh, i'm alive with pleasure now. 
<ross> hey pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that pop-tart?.. pheebs? 
<phoebe> does anyone want the rest of this pop-tart? 
<ross> hey, i might! 
<phoebe> sorry. ..y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb. 
<s> you're kidding. oh my god. 
<phoebe> and on my way over here, i stepped in gum. ...what is up with the universe?! 
<joey>  what's going on? 
<monica> nothing. i just think it's nice when we're all here together. 
<joey> even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.. 
<rachel> uh, joey.. 
<joey> oh, god!  
<monica>  okay.. 
<s> oh! that was lambchop! 
<monica> please, guys, we have to talk. 
<phoebe> wait, wait, i'm getting a deja vu...no, i'm not. 
<monica> alright, we have to talk. 
<phoebe> there it is!

<ross> look, it's just a little more complicated... 
<chandler> well, what? what? what is it? that she left you? that she likes women? that she left you for another woman that likes women? 
<ross> little louder, okay, i think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...

<ross> not that big a deal? it's amazing. ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. all right, as far as i'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. am i right? 
<rachel> come on! you guys can pee standing up. 
<chandler> we can? all right, i'm tryin' that. 
<joey> ok, you know what blows my mind? women can see breasts any time they want. you just look down and there they are. how you get any work done is beyond me. 
<phoebe> oh, ok, you know what i don't get? the way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.

<chandler> oh, right, right, shut up. 
<monica> chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. you just gotta do it. 
<chandler> no, i know, but it's just so hard, you know? i mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note. 
<joey> why do you have to break up with her? be a man, just stop calling. 
<phoebe> you know, if you want, i'll do it with you. 
<chandler> oh, thanks, but i think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her. 
<phoebe> no, i mean you break up with janice and i'll break up with tony. 
<ross> tony? 
<monica> oh, you're breaking up with tony? 
<phoebe> yeah, i know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? i don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, i don't know. 
<rachel>  does anybody want anything else? 
<ross> oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing.  nothing, just, just, i'm fine. 
<phoebe>  what's the matter? why so scrunchy? 
<rachel> it's my father. he wants to give me a mercedes convertible. 
<ross> that guy, he burns me up. 
<rachel> yeah, well, it's a mercedes if i move back home. oh, it was horrible. he called me young lady. 
<chandler> ooh, i hate when my father calls me that. 
<monica> did he give you that whole "you're-not-up-to-this" thing again? 
<rachel> oh, yeah, yeah. actually, i got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "you'll never make it on your own". 
<phoebe>  uh-huh, uh-huh.  
<s> hi, joey. 
<joey> my god, angela.

<joey> you don't say.  
<ross> so, uh, rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight? 
<rachel> oh, big glamour night. me and monica at laundorama.

<rachel> who? 
<ross> me. was that not clear? hey, why don't, um, why don't i just join you both, here? 
<rachel> don't you have a laundry room in your building? 
<ross> yes, i do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. anyway, say, sevenish? 
<rachel> sure.  
<s> forget it joey. i'm with bob now. 
<joey> bob? who the hell's bob?

<joey>  i know, but, i made a huge mistake. i never should have broken up with her. will you help me? please? 
< 
<ross>  ok, bye.  well, monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and rachel. 
<chandler> oh. well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?

<rachel> well, not myself, but i know other people that have. ok, you caught me. i'm a laundry virgin. 
<ross> uh, well, don't worry, i'll use the gentle cycle. ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things. 
<rachel>  ok, well, what about these are white cotton panties. would they go with whites or delicates?

<s> all right. well, there you go.  stop it, stop it, stop it. 
< 
<rachel> ok, i know this is gonna sound really stupid, but i feel that if i can do this, you know, if i can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything i can't do. 
<ross> that does not sound stupid to me. you know, it's like the first time i had to make dinner for myself, after carol left me?  i'm sorry, that's all the time we have. next on ross... uh-oh.

<ross> no, of course not!  ...yeah, yeah, it is. 
<monica> what? so you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else? 
<joey> i couldn't do it. 
<monica> good for you, joey. 
<joey> when i'm with a woman, i need to know that i'm going out with more people than she is. 
<ross> well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. i mean, anthropologically speaking-  
<ross> fine. fine, alright, now you'll never know. 
<monica> we're kidding. c'mon, tell us! 
<s> yeah! c'mon! 
<ross> alright. there's a theory, put forth by richard leakey-

<rachel> look! i cleaned! i did the windows, i did the floors... i even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, i don't know what that's for. 
<ross> oh yeah, nobody knows. and we're not supposed to ask. 
<rachel> well, whaddya think?

<monica> that is so unfair! 
<ross> oh c'mon! when we were kids, yours was the only raggedy ann doll that wasn't raggedy! 
<monica> okay, so i'm responsible, i'm organised. but hey, i can be a kook. 
<ross> alright, you madcap gal. try to imagine this. the phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away. 
<monica> why not? 
<ross> because you're a kook! instead you wait until they send you a notice. 
<monica> i could do that. 
<rachel> okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and i buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout. 
<monica> why would someone do that?! ...one might wonder. 
<chandler> someone's left a glass on the coffee table. there's no coaster. it's a cold drink, it's a hot day. little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood... 
<monica> stop it!! ...oh my god. it's true! who am i?

<s> ...like, ...all of them? 
<chandler> c'mon, we're great together, why not? 
<s> why can't we just have what we have now? why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight i thought that's what you wanted too. 
<chandler> ...well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like i'm two guys, y'know? i mean, one guy's going 'shut up! this is great!' but there's this other guy. actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... and he's saying, y'know, 'this is too hard! get out! get out!' 
<s> so... which one of the two guys will you listen to? 
<chandler> i don't know, i-i have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish... 
<s> which one? 
<chandler> ...the second guy. 
<s>  well, call me if you change your mind.

<joey> my mom will. 
<chandler> something so sweet and...disturbing about that. 
<joey> y'know, i've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. and i finally get my shot, and i blow it! 
<monica> maybe this wasn't your shot. 
<ross> yeah, i mean... i think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. did it... feel like your shot..? 
<joey> hard to tell, i was naked. 
<phoebe> no, i don't think this was your shot. i mean, i don't even think you just get one shot. i really believe big things are gonna happen for you, i do! you've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'i got the part! i got the part! i'm gonna be joey tribbiani's ass!'. 
<joey> yeah? that's so nice!   
<monica> i'm sorry, joey. i'm gonna go to bed, guys.

<rachel> i just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park. 
<ross> well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line. 
<rachel> there, well, see? barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course. 
<ross> come on. 
<rachel> no, he said we were holding up the people behind us. 
<ross>  and you didn't marry him because...? 
<rachel> i mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of... 
<ross> probably. but you know, i'll tell you something. passion is way overrated. 
<rachel> yeah right. 
<ross> it is. eventually, it kind of... burns out. but hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. so, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff. 
<rachel>  ok. 
<ross> but, um... i don't think that's going to be you. 
<rachel> you don't.

<ross> i will, i will. see, i'm waiting for the right moment.  what? what, now? 
<joey> yeeeeaaaahhh! what's messing you up? the wine? the candles? the moonlight? you've just got to go up to her and say, 'rachel, i think that...'

<rachel>  pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker? 
<s>  your grandmother would have hated this. 
<monica> well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all. 
<s> no, i'd be hearing about 'why didn't i get the honey-glazed ham?', i didn't spend enough on flowers, and if i spent more she'd be saying 'why are you wasting your money? i don't need flowers, i'm dead'. 
<monica> that sounds like nana. 
<s> do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say? 
<monica> ...i can imagine. 
<s> i'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is. 
<monica> that is a wonder. so tell me something, mom. if you had to do it all over again, i mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her? 
<s> tell her what? 
<monica> how she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example. 
<s> i'm not sure i know what you're getting at. 
<monica> do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth? 
<s> ...no. i think some things are better left unsaid. i think it's nicer when people just get along. 
<monica> huh. 
<s> more wine, dear? 
<monica> oh, i think so. 
<s>  those earrings look really lovely on you. 
<monica> thank you. they're yours.

<rachel> terry, i, i, i know that i haven't worked here very long, but i was wondering, do you think it would be possible if i got a $100 advance in my salary? 
<s> an advance? 
<rachel> it's so that i can spend thanksgiving with my family. see, every year we go skiing in vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but i sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why i took this job. 
<s> rachel, rachel, sweetheart. you're a terrible, terrible waitress. really, really awful. 
<rachel> ok, i, i hear what you're sayin'. i'm with you. um, but i, but i'm trying really hard. and i think i'm doing better. i really do. does anybody need coffee?  oh, look at that. opening credits

<monica> hey. ross, did you know mom and dad are going to puerto rico for thanksgiving?

<joey> yes, i am. as of today, i am officially joey tribbiani, actor slash model. 
<chandler> that's so funny, 'cause i was thinking you look more like joey tribbiani, man slash woman. 
<phoebe> what were you modeling for? 
<joey> you know those posters for the city free clinic? 
<monica> oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"? 
<phoebe> you know, the asthma guy was really cute. 
<chandler> do you know which one you're gonna be? 
<joey> no, but i hear lyme disease is open, so...  
<chandler> good luck, man. i hope you get it. 
<joey> thanks.  
<ross>  well, you were right. how can they do this to us, huh? it's thanksgiving. 
<monica> ok, i'll tell you what. how about i cook dinner at my place? i'll make it just like mom's.

<monica> you know, they're not actually supposed to have...  i'll work on the lumps. joey, you're going home, right? 
<joey> yeah. 
<monica> and i assume, chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays. 
<chandler> yes, every single one of them. 
<monica> phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma? 
<phoebe> yes, and her boyfriend. but we're celebrating thanksgiving in december 'cause he is lunar. 
<monica> so you're free thursday, then. 
<phoebe> yeah. oh, can i come? 
<monica> yeah. rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to vail? 
<rachel> absolutely. shoop, shoop, shoop. only a hundred and two dollars to go. 
<chandler> i thought it was $98.50. 
<rachel> yeah, well it was. i, i broke a cup. 
<ross> well, i'm off to carol's. 
<phoebe> ooh, ooh! why don't we invite her? 
<ross>  ooh, ooh. because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner. 
< 
<ross> hi, is uh, is carol here? 
<s> no, she's at a faculty meeting. 
<ross> oh, i uh, just came by to pick up my skull. well, not mine, but...susan come in. 
<ross> thanks. yeah, carol borrowed it for a class, and i have to get it back to the museum. 
<s> what's it look like? 
<ross> kinda like a big face without skin. 
<s> yes, i'm familiar with the concept. we can just look for it. 
<ross> ok.  wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian. 
<s> well, you know, you have to take a course. otherwise, they don't let you do it. 
<ross>  hey, hey, yertle the turtle. a classic. 
<s> actually, i'm reading it to the baby. 
<ross> the uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? wouldn't that mean you're... crazy? 
<s> what, you don't think they can hear sounds in there? 
<ross> you're not serious, i mean, you really... you really talk to it? 
<s> yeah, all the time. i want the baby to know my voice. 
<ross> do you uh, do you talk about me? 
<s> yeah, yeah, all the time. 
<ross> really? 
<s> but um, we just refer to you as bobo the sperm guy. 
< 
<ross> look, if she's talking to it, i just think that i should get some belly time too. not that i believe any of this. 
<phoebe> oh, i believe it. i think the baby can totally hear everything. i can show you. look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say. 
<chandler> i'd just like to say that i'm totally behind this experiment. in fact, i'd very much like to butter your head.  
<monica> hey, rach, did you make your money? 
<rachel> no, not even close. forget vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop. 
<monica> rach, here's your mail. 
<rachel> thanks, you can just put it on the table. 
<monica>  no, here's your mail. 
<rachel> thanks, you can just put it on the table.

<monica>  you owe me 20 bucks. 
<rachel> thank you. thank you so much! 
<monica>  chandler, here you go, got your traditional thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of funyuns. 
<rachel> wait, wait, chandler, this is what you're havin' for thanksgiving dinner? what, what, what is it with you and this holiday? 
<chandler> all right, i'm nine years old. 
<ross> oh, i hate this story. 
<chandler> we just finished this magnificent thanksgiving dinner. i have--and i remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced. 
<rachel> oh my god. 
<chandler> yes. it's very difficult to appreciate a thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse. 
< 
<joey> uh, hi. we uh, we used to work together. 
<s> we did? 
<joey> yeah, at macy's. you were the obsession girl, right? i was the aramis guy.  aramis? aramis? 
<s> yeah, right. 
<joey> i gotta tell you. you're the best in the business. 
<s> get out. 
<joey> i'm serious. you're amazing. you know when to spritz, when to lay back. 
<s> really? you don't know what that means to me. 
<joey> ooh, you smell great tonight. what're you wearing? 
<s>  nothing. 
<joey> listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something? 
<s> yeah.  oh. 
<joey> what's wrong? 
<s> i just remembered, i have to do something. 
<joey> oh. what? 
<s> um, leave. 
<joey> wait, wait, wait! mario isn't telling you...v.d., you never know who might have it. a variety of scenes are shown with the poster displayed all over new york city.) 
< 
<joey> so i guess you all saw it. 
<rachel> saw what? 
<phoebe> no, we were just laughing. you know, how laughter can be infectious. 
< 
<joey> set another place for thanksgiving. my entire family thinks i have vd. 
<chandler> tonight, on a very special blossom. commercial break 
< 
<monica> mmm, looking good. ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming.  what? 
<ross> i don't know. it's just not the same without mom in the kitchen. 
<monica> all right, that's it. you know what? just get out of my way and stop moping. 
<ross> that's closer.  
<rachel> i got the tickets! i got the tickets! five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop. 
<chandler> oh, you must stop shooping. 
<rachel> ok, i'm gonna get my stuff. 
<joey> chandler, will you just come in already? 
<chandler> no, i prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.  
<phoebe> look out, incoming pumpkin pie! 
<chandler> ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.  
<joey> hey, monica, i got a question. i don't see any tater tots. 
<monica> that's not a question. 
<joey> but my mom always makes them. it's like a tradition. you get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! it's bad enough i can't be with my family because of my disease. 
<monica> all right, fine. tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots. 
<ross> ok, i'm off to talk to my unborn child.  
<monica> ah! 
<ross> ok, mom never hit.  
<phoebe>  ok, all done. 
<monica> what, phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? ross needs lumps! 
<phoebe> oh, i'm sorry, oh, i just, i thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions. 
<monica> why would we do that? 
<phoebe> well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died. 
<monica> ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up. 
<rachel> ok, good-bye you guys. thanks for everything.  oh, sorry! oh, sorry!  
<chandler> the most unbelievable thing has happened. underdog has just gotten away. 
<joey> the balloon? 
<chandler> no, no, the actual cartoon character. of course the balloon. it's all over the news. right before he reached macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over washington square park. i'm goin' to the roof, who's with me? 
<rachel> i can't, i gotta go. 
<chandler> come on. an 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. how often does that happen? 
<phoebe> almost never. 
<monica> got the keys? or got the keys! 
<rachel> ok.  
< 
<s> anytime you're ready. 
<ross> ok, ok, here we go.  ok, where am i talking to, here? i mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but... 
<s> just aim for the bump. 
<ross> ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. you know, i, you know, can't do this. uh, this is too weird. i feel stupid. 
<s> so don't do it, it's fine. you don't have to do it just because susan does it. 
<ross>  hello, baby. hello, hello. 
< 
<rachel> i loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park. 
<phoebe> yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? i mean, that was just mean. 
<monica> ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. why are we standing here? 
<rachel> we're waiting for you to open the door. you got the keys. 
<monica> no i don't. 
<rachel> yes, you do. when we left, you said, "got the keys." 
<monica> no i didn't. i asked, "got the ke-eys?" 
<rachel> no, no, no, you said, "got the keys". 
<chandler> do either of you have the keys? 
<monica>  the oven is on. 
<rachel> oh, i gotta get my ticket! 
<joey> wait, wait, we have a copy of your key. 
<monica> well then get it, get it! 
<joey> that tone will not make me go any faster. 
<monica>  joey! 
<joey> that one will.  
< 
<ross> and everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. so, on a dare, i picked paleontology. and you have no idea what i'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. you're just happy you don't have gills anymore. 
<s> look, you don't have to talk to it. you can sing to it if you want. 
<ross> oh, please. i am not singing to your stomach, ok?  
<s> hi, how's it goin? 
<ross> shh!  here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. hey, hey!  hey, uh, did you just feel that? 
<s> i did. 
<ross> does it always, uh--? 
<s> no, no that was the first. 
<s> keep singing! keep singing! 
<ross>  hey, hey, you're my baby, and i can't wait to meet you. when you come out i'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo. 
<s> i felt it! 
<ross>  hey, hey, i'm your daddy. i'm the one without any breasts. 
< 
<joey> nope, not that one. 
<monica> can you go any faster with that? 
<joey> hey, i got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. you do the math. 
<monica> why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway? 
<chandler>  for an emergency just like this. 
<rachel>  all right, listen, smirky. if it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, i would be on a plane watching a woman do this  right now. but i'm not. 
<monica> i swear you said you had the keys. 
<rachel> no, i didn't. i wouldn't say i had the keys unless i had the keys, and i obviously didn't have the keys. 
<phoebe> ooh, ok, that's it. enough with the keys. no one say keys.  
<monica> why would i have the keys? 
<rachel> aside from the fact that you said you had them? 
<monica> but i didn't. 
<rachel> well, you should have. 
<monica> why? 
<rachel> because! 
<monica> why? 
<rachel> because! 
<monica> why? because everything is my responsibility? isn't it enough that i'm making thanksgiving dinner for everyone? you know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so i'm making different kinds of potatoes. does anybody care what kind of potatoes i want? nooooo, no, no!  just as long as phoebe gets her peas and onions, and mario gets his tots, and it's my first thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and i... i... 
<chandler> ok, monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. here we go.  
<monica> well, the turkey's burnt.  potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.  
<ross> here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like mom's. 
<monica> no, it doesn't, does it? but you wanted lumps, ross?  well, here you go, buddy, ya got one. 
<rachel> oh, god, this is great! the plane is gone, so it looks like i'm stuck here with you guys. 
<joey> hey, we all had better plans. this was nobody's first choice. 
<monica> oh, really? so why was i busting my ass to make this delicious thanksgiving dinner? 
<joey> you call that delicious?  
<monica> stop it, stop it, stop it! 
<chandler> now this feels like thanksgiving. 
<phoebe> ooh. 
<rachel> what? 
<phoebe> ugly naked guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. oh my god. he's not alone. ugly naked guy's having thanksgiving dinner with ugly naked gal.  
<joey> i've gotta see this. all right ugly naked guy! 
<monica> ooh, ugly naked dancing! 
<phoebe> it's nice that he has someone. 
<chandler> shall i carve? 
<rachel> by all means. 
<chandler> ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese? 
<ross> i don't even wanna know about the dark cheese. 
<monica>  does anybody wanna split this with me? 
<joey> oh, i will. 
<phoebe> ooh, you guys have to make a wish. 
<monica> make a wish? 
<phoebe> come on, you know, thanksgiving. ooh, you got the bigger half. what'd you wish for? 
<joey> the bigger half. 
<chandler> i'd like to propose a toast. little toast here, ding ding. i know this isn't the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, i think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. anyway, i was just thinking, i mean, if you'd gone to vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? so i guess what i'm trying to say is that i'm very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked. 
<s> that's so sweet.

<ross> yeah. i mean, it's been kinda quiet since carol left, so... 
<monica> why don't you just get a roommate? 
<ross> nah, i dunno... i think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe-  ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'. opening credits

<s> no. no, that's- that's okay.

<s> noth- i was- i was just saying to my- 
<phoebe> could you speak up please? 
<s>  sorry, i wa- i was just saying to my friend that i thought you were the most beautiful woman that i'd ever seen in my- in my life. and then he said that- you said you thought 
<s> daryl hannah. 
<s> daryl hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and i said yeah, i liked her in splash, a lot, but not so much in- in wall street, i thought she had kind of a 
<s> hard quality. 
<s> -hard quality. and uh, while daryl hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling.  
<phoebe> okay, we're gonna take a short break.  
<joey> hey, that guy's going home with more than a note! 
< 
<ross> come here, marcel. sit here.  
<rachel> pheebs, i can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. i mean god, by my sixth date with paolo, i mean he had already named both my breasts! ...ooh. did i just share too much? 
<ross> just a smidge.

<monica> i think it's romantic. 
<phoebe> me too! oh! did you ever see an officer and a gentleman? 
<rachel> yeah! 
<phoebe> well, he's kinda like the guy i went to see that with. except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... i just- i just wanna be with him all the time. day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... 
<chandler> wait a minute, wait a minute, i see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to new year's, aren't you. you're gonna break the pact. she's gonna break the pact.

<ross> okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right? 
<monica> do you always have to bring him here? 
<ross> i didn't wanna leave him alone. alright? we- we had our first fight this morning. i think it has to do with my working late. i said some things that i didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces... 
<chandler> y'know, if you're gonna work late, i could look in on him for you. 
<ross> oh, that'd be great! okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me. 
<chandler> okay, but if he asks, i'm not going to lie. 
< 
<s> ...but, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions. 
<phoebe> okay, alright, i have a question, then. 
<s> yuh. 
<phoebe> um, were you planning on kissing me ever? 
<s> uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. and, uh, the answer would be  yes. yes i was. but, see, i wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you. 
<phoebe> sure. 
<s> right. but, see, the longer i waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where i just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. and, uh, i'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella. 
<phoebe> oh, david, i, i think you are a sweeping sorta fella. i mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body. 
<s> rrrreally.

<ross> no! okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?

<monica> oh, i don't know. maybe, um, "that was nice?" admit something to me? "i'll call you?" 
<phoebe> i don't think you mean that. 
<monica> this is so typical. y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. and then- we just get nothing back! and then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "see you around!" let's go, phoebe. 
<phoebe> y'know what? we thought you were different. but i guess it was just the coma. 
< my book for your friends. anything you want from lisbon?

<joey> no, no. he said "when are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?" 
<ross> wow! 
<joey> then she came back with "the question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise i have a bomb?" 
<ross> 'kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "when are you gonna grow up and realise i am your mom?" 
<joey> that makes more sense.

<joey> how'd you get to that? 
<chandler> well, i believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with angela delvecchio 
<joey> you knew about that? 
<chandler> well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination. 
<joey> ok, ok, how about if we split it? 
<chandler> what do you mean, like, buy it together? 
<joey> yeah 
<chandler> you think we're ready for something like that? 
<joey> why not? 
<chandler> well, it's a pretty big commitment, i mean, what if one of us wants to move out? 
<joey> why, are you moving out? 
<chandler> i'm not moving out. 
<joey> you'd tell me if you were moving out right 
<chandler> yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate kip...

<joey> i don't know, birds just don't say, "hello, sit here, eat something." 
<chandler> you pick one. 
<joey> all right, how about the ladybugs?

<phoebe> oh!  ok, um, ok, um, 
<rachel> oh, pheebs, pheebs... 
<phoebe> ok, um,  we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. one, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, i never lie, and three, i make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.  
<rachel>  ok, thanks pheebs  oh my god, why have i never tasted these before?! 
<phoebe> oh, i don't make them a lot because i don't think it's fair to the other cookies 
<rachel> all right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies i've ever had. 
<phoebe> which proves that i never lie. 
<rachel> i guess you don't. 
<phoebe> paolo made a pass at me.  
< 
<chandler> so, what do you think? 
<ross> i think it's the most beautiful table i've ever seen. 
<chandler> i know!  
<monica> so how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads? 
<joey> who cares, we'll eat at the sink! come on, let's play! 
<monica> heads up ross!  score!  you suck!  
< 
<phoebe> are you okay? 
<rachel> i need some milk. 
<phoebe> ok, i've got milk  here you go...  oh! better? 
<rachel> no...oh, i feel so stupid! oh, i think about the other day with you guys and i was all "oh, paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..." oh, god, i'm so embarrassed! 
<phoebe> i'm so embarrassed, i'm the one he hit on!  
<rachel> pheebs, if i had never met him this never would have happened! i'm sorry! 
<phoebe> no, wait, oh, what are we sorry about? 
<rachel> i don't know...right, he's the pig!

<rachel> he's like a big disgusting... 
<phoebe> ...like a... 
<rachel> ...pig...pig man! 
<phoebe> yes, good! ok... 
<rachel>  oh, but he was my pig man...how did i not see this? 
<phoebe>  oh! i know!  it's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you... 
<rachel> ok, ok, pheebs... 
<phoebe> the end. 
<rachel> oh, god... 
<phoebe> should i not have told you? 
<rachel> no, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that i know. uh, i just liked it better before it was better...  
< 
<phoebe> i think she took it pretty well. you know paolo's over there right now, so... 
<monica> we should get over there and see if she's okay.  just one...second! score!  game! come on.  
<ross>  ah...ooh! well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts. 
<joey> no-no, she kicked our butts. you could be on the olympic standing-there team. 
<ross> come on, two on one. 
<chandler> what are you still doing here? she just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in! 
<ross> what, now? 
<joey> yes, now is when you swoop! you gotta make sure that when paolo walks out of there, the first guy rachel sees is you, she's gotta know that you're everything he's not! you're like, like the anti-paolo! 
<chandler> my catholic friend is right. she's distraught. you're there for her. you pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of ross!  
< 
<s> no, that's cold, that's cold, that's...  
<ross>  how's it going? 
<monica> don't stare. now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , ok, that is either, "how could you?" or, "enormous breasts!" here he comes! 
<phoebe> ooh!  
<s> uh, i am, uh, to say good-bye. 
<phoebe> oh, ok bye-bye. 
<monica> paolo, i really hate you for what you did to rachel,  but i still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles. 
<s> grazie. 
<ross> paolo, i-i just want to tell you and i think i speak for everyone when i say...  
<phoebe> oh, just look at her...  
<ross> oh you guys, i-i really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed... 
<monica> oh, you're right. 
<ross>  ...and i really think it should be me.  
<ross> hey. 
<rachel> hey. 
<ross> you all right? 
<rachel> ooh, i've been better... 
<ross> come here.  listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, i mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you. 
<rachel> oh, ross... 
<ross> what? 
<rachel> i am so sick of guys. i don't want to look at another guy, i don't want to think about another guy, i don't even want to be near another guy.  
<ross> huh. 
<rachel> oh ross, you're so great! 
<ross> ohhhh   
<monica> ooh...hey honey, are you all right? 
<rachel> oh... 
<phoebe> you ok? 
<rachel> ...medium...hmm...any cookies left? 
<phoebe> yep! 
<ross> see, rach, uh, see, i don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. i really don't. i think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process. 
<rachel> no. i just need to be by myself for a while, you know? i just got to figure out what i want 
<ross> uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a paolo. 
<rachel> no, i know, i know, and i'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one. 
<ross>  what? 
<rachel> what? 
<ross> i-i'm, i'm having a boy? 
<rachel> uh...no. no, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.

<rachel> okaaay.  any of you guys want anything else? 
<chandler> oh, yes, could i have one of those.  
<rachel> no, i'm sorry, we're all out of those. anybody else? 
<chandler> okay. 
<s> did i, uh, did i miss something? 
<chandler> no, she's still upset because i saw her boobies. 
<ross> you what? wh what were you doing seeing her boobies? 
<chandler> it was an accident. not like i was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts. 
<rachel> okay, okay, could we change the subject, please? 
<phoebe> yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts. 
<rachel> okay, pheebs, i was hoping for more of a change. 
<chandler> y'know, i don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies. 
<rachel> nice? they were nice. i mean, that's it? i mean, mittens are nice. 
<chandler> okaaay,  rock, hard place, me. 
<s> you're so funny! he's really funny! i wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops. 
<chandler> whoah whoah, back up there, sparky. what'd you mean by that? 
<s> oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance. 
<chandler> huh. 
<s> i mean hey! i just met you, i don't know you from adam. ...only child, right? parents divorced before you hit puberty. 
<chandler> uhhuh, how did you know that? 
<s> it's textbook.

<s> hey! hey, mr. trib! 
<monica> hey, how long are you in the city? 
<s> just for a coupla days. i got a job midtown. i figure i'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry.  i don't know this one. 
<phoebe> oh, this is my friend roger. 
<s> hi. 
<s> hey, hey. good to meet you, roger. 
<s> you too, sir.

< 
<s> gotta go. i miss you too, i love you, but it's getting real late now 
<joey>  hey ma. listen, i made the appointment with dr. bazida, and... excuse me?  did you know this isn't ma?  
<s> her name's ronni. she's a pet mortician. 
<joey> sure. so how long you been...  
<s> remember when you were a little kid, i used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships? 
<joey> since then?! 
<s> no, it's only been six years. i just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that i wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...joe. y'ever been in love? 
<joey> ...i d'know. 
<s> then y'haven't. you're burning your tomatoes. 
<joey> you're one to talk.  
<s> joe, your dad's in love big time. and the worst part of it is, it's with two different women. 
<joey> oh man. please tell me one of 'em is ma. 
<s> of course, course one of 'em's ma. what's the matter with you. 
< 
<joey> it's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. he's like actually some spy, working for the c.i.a.  that'd be cool.... this blows! 
<rachel> i know, i mean, why can't parents just stay parents?  why do they have to become people? why do they have...  why can't you stop staring at my breasts? 
<chandler>  what?  what? 
<rachel> did you not get a good enough look the other day? 
<ross> alright, alright. we're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. since you saw her boobies, i think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee. 
<chandler> y'know, i don't see that happening? 
<rachel> c'mon, he's right. tit for tat. 
<chandler> well i'm not showing you my 'tat.'  
<monica> hello? 
<phoebe>  it's phoebe. 
<s>  and rog. 
<monica> c'mon up. 
<chandler>  oh, good. rog is here. 
<joey> what's the matter with rog? 
<ross> yeah. 
<chandler> oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... i hate that guy. 
<ross> what, so he was a little analytical. that's what he does, y'know? c'mon, he's not that bad.  
<ross> y'see, that's where you're wrong. why would i marry her if i thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian? 
<s> i dunno. maybe you wanted your marriage to fail. 
<ross> why? why would i why? why? why? why? 
<s> i don't know. maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you... 
<monica> wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing. 
<s> well, i don't know. i mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents. 
<ross> that that's ridiculous! i don't feel guilty for her failures! 
<monica> oh! so you think i'm a failure! 
<phoebe> isn't he good? 
<ross> nonono, thatthat's not what i was saying... 
<monica> y'know, all these years, i thought you were on my side. but maybe what you were doing was sucking up to mom and dad so they'd keep liking you better! 
<ross> hey, i married a lesbian to make you look good!  
<rachel> you're right! i mean you're right! it wasn't just the weebles, but it was the weeble play palace, and and the weebles' cruise ship. oh, which had this little lifeboat for the weebles to wobble in. 
<s> that's tough. tough stuff. c'mon, pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going. 
<phoebe> oh, okay. feel better, rachel, 'kay?

<s> oh no, not you, big joey. oh my god, you're so much cuter than your pictures!  i-i'm, i'm ronni....cheese nip? 
<chandler> uh, joey's having an embolism, but i'd go for a nip, y'know? commercial break 
< 
<s> now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. but occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee. 
<chandler> joey, if i go first, i wanna be looking for my keys. 
<s> that's a good one!

<s> you're gonna keep an eye on us? 
<joey> that's right, mister, and i don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. and that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.

<s> thanks. you're, uh, you're a good kid.

<joey> okay. now this is just for tonight. starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. this has gone on long enough. 
<s> what kinda change? 
<joey> well, either you break it off with ronni

<joey> i've been thinking. y'know, about how i'm always seeing girls on top of girls... 
<chandler> are they end to end, or tall like pancakes? 
<joey> y'know what i mean, about how i'm always going out with all these women. and i always figured, when the right one comes along, i'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? now i'm looking at my dad, thinking... 
<chandler> hey, you're not him. you're you. when they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave? 
<joey> no. 
<chandler> no. you decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. now that wasn't easy, but you did it! and i'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "no thanks, i'm married." 
<joey> you really think so? 
<chandler> yeah. i really do. 
<joey> thanks, chandler.  
<chandler> get off! 
< 
<s> hi. 
<monica> hi...may i help you? 
<s> yeah, uh, joey said i could use your shower, since, uh, chandler's in ours? 
<monica> okay...who are you? 
<s> oh, i'm ronni. ronni rappelano? the mistress? 
<monica> oh, c'mon in. 
<s> thanks. 
<rachel> hi, i'm rachel. 
<s> hi. 
<rachel> bathroom's up there. 
<s> great. 
<rachel> hey, listen, ronni, how long would you say chandler's been in the shower? 
<s> oh, like, uh, five minutes? 
<rachel> perfect. fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time.  hey, mr. trib. 
<s> hey. morning, dear.  
<rachel> chandler bing? it's time to see your thing.  
<joey>  what's the matter with you?! 
<rachel> i thought it was chandler! 
<chandler>  what? what? 
<rachel> you were supposed to be in there so i could see your thing! 
<chandler> sorry, my my thing was in there with me. 
< 
<s> hey, pheebs. 
<phoebe> hey. 
<monica> how's it going? 
<phoebe> good. oh oh! roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.  
<phoebe> so what's going on? 
<monica> nothing, um, it's just, um... it's roger. 
<ross> i dunno, there's just something about... 
<chandler> basically we just feel that he's... 
<rachel> we hate that guy. 
<s> yeah. hate him. 
<ross> we're sorry, pheebs, we're sorry. 
<phoebe> uh-huh. okay. okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out? 
<s> ...no, we hate him. 
<rachel> we're sorry. 
< 
<joey> ma! what're you doing here?  
<joey> oww! big ring! garbage about making things right? things were fine the way they were! there's chicken in there, put it away. for god's sake, joey, really.  
<joey> hold on, you-you knew? bond. you should've heard some of his cover stories. "i'm sleeping over at my accountant's," i mean, what is that? please! 
<joey> so then how could you i mean, how could you?! always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. now he's happy! i mean, it's nice, he has a hobby. 
<joey> ma, i don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! i mean, what about you? and your father would look like sting. and i'll tell you something else. ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... i mean, it's like every day's our anniversary. 
<joey> i'm...happy...for you? it the way it was. 
<joey> ma, i'm sorry. i just did what i thought you'd want. see her? 
<joey> yeah. you're ten times prettier than she is. 
<joey> with this ring?  no contest. 
< 
<s> what's wrong, sweetie? 
<phoebe> nothing, nothing. 
<s> aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon.  
<phoebe> it's, i mean, it's nothing, i'm fine. it's my friends. they-they have a liking problem with you. in that, um, they don't. 
<s> oh. they don't. 
<phoebe> but they don't see all the wonderfulness that i see. they don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. they just think you're a little... 
<s> what? 
<phoebe> intense and creepy. 
<s> oh. 
<phoebe> but i don't. me, phoebe. 
<s> well, i'm not i'm not at all surprised they feel that way. 
<phoebe> you're not? see, that's why you're so great! 
<s> actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, i'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'oh, define me! define me! love me, i need love!'. 
< 
<monica> so you talked to your dad, huh. 
<joey> yeah. he's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that i found out today. 
<rachel> wow. 
<chandler> things sure have changed here on waltons mountain. 
<ross> so joey, you okay? 
<joey> yeah, i guess. it's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes. 
<rachel> just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them. 
<chandler> if i turn into my parents, i'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... i'll end up like my mom. 
<phoebe>  hey. 
<s> hey, pheebs. 
<monica> how's it going? 
<phoebe> oh, okay, except i broke up with roger. 
<s> awww. 
<phoebe> yeah, right. 
<s> aaawwwwww!! 
<rachel> what happened? 
<phoebe> i don't know, i mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways i think he is so right for me, it's just... i hate that guy! closing credits 
< 
<phoebe> hey, joey. what's going on? 
<joey> clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. next stop

<joey> sorry. wrong boobies.  
<monica> hello, joey.  
< 
<joey> i'm tellin' you ross, she wants you. 
<ross> she barely knows me. we just live in the same building. 
<chandler> any contact? 
<ross> she lent me an egg once. 
<joey> you're in! 
<ross> aw, right. 
<s> hi, ross. 
<ross> hey.  
<chandler> come on, ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? the rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbiani don't think we need a third... 
<joey> excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? thanks. 
<ross> an egg? 
<joey> yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "here's your egg back, i'm returning your egg." 
<chandler> i think it's winning. 
<ross> i think it's insane. 
<chandler> she'll love it. go with the egg, my friend.  
<joey> think it'll work? 
<chandler> no, it's suicide. the man's got an egg. opening credits 
< 
<monica> you can not do this. 
<rachel> do what, do what? 
<monica> roger wants to take her out tomorrow night. 
<rachel> no! phoebes! don't you remember why you dumped the guy? 
<phoebe> 'cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on valentine's day! 
<monica> but phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. i know i do. 
<rachel> well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night? 
<joey> actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes. 
<chandler> oh, uh, listen, about tonight... 
<joey> no, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. the only reason she's goin' out with me is because i said i could bring a friend for her friend. 
<chandler> yes, i know, but her friend sounds like such a... 
<joey> pathetic mess? i know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. i'm thinkin', cha-ching!  thanks. look, you have not been out with a woman since janice. you're doin' this. 
<ross> hi. she said yes. 
<chandler> yes! way to go, man!  still got the egg, huh? 
< 
<joey>  how do i look? 
<chandler> oh, uh, i... don't... care.  ok, now, remember, no trading. you get the pretty one, i get the mess. 
<s> hi, joey. well well, look what you brought. very nice. 
<chandler> ...and what did you bring? 
<s> she's checking the coats. joey, i'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. will you get me a white zinfandel, and a glass of red for janice. 
<chandler> janice?  
<s> oh.... my.... god. 
<chandler>  hey, it's janice. 
< 
<chandler> ok, i'm makin' a break for it, i'm goin' out the window. 
<joey> no, no, no, don't! i've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with lorraine. just calm down. 
<chandler> calm down? calm down? you set me up with the woman that i've dumped twice in the last five months! 
<joey>  can you stop yellin'? you're makin' me nervous, and i can't go when i'm nervous. 
<chandler> i'm sorry, i'm sorry, you're right.  come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!! 
< 
<rachel> ok, ok, roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to pete carney. 
<monica> which one was pete carney? 
<rachel> pete the weeper? remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex.  "was it good for you?" 
<monica> yeah, well, i'll take a little crying any day over howard-the-"i-win"-guy.  "i win! i win!" i went out with the guy for two monthsi didn't get to win once. 
<rachel> how did we end up with these jerks? we're good people! 
<monica> i don't know. maybe we're some kinda magnets. 
<phoebe> i know i am. that's why i can't wear a digital watch. 
<monica> there's more beer, right? 
<phoebe> oh! you know my friend abby who shaves her head? she said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual. 
<rachel> pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald. 
<phoebe> yeah. so, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. it's valentine's day. it's perfect. 
<monica> ok, well, what kind of ritual? 
<phoebe> ok. we can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us. 
<rachel> or? 
<phoebe> or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks. 
<monica> burning's good. 
<rachel> burning's good. yeah, i got stuff to burn. 
< 
<s> you know, ever since i was little, i've been able to pick up quarters with my toes. 
<joey> good for you.  uh, quarters or rolls of quarters? 
<s> by the way, chandler. i cut you out of all my pictures. so if you want, i have a bag with just your heads. 
<chandler> that's ok. 
<s> oh, are you sure? really? because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.  
<joey>  we can't do that. 
<chandler>  what? what can't you do? 
<joey> uh, can i talk to you for a second, over there?  
<joey> uh, we might be leaving now. 
<chandler> tell me it's "you and me" we. 
<joey> she said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. i'm not even sure what slathering is, but i definitely want to be a part of it. 
<chandler> ok, you can not do this to me. 
<joey> you're right, i'm sorry. you're right. 
<s>  uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please? 
<joey> i'm outta here. here's my credit card. dinner's on me. i'm sorry, chandler.

<chandler> excuse me.  how ya doin'? 
<s> so, do we have the best friends or what? 
<chandler> joey's not a friend. he's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. another drink? some dessert? a big screen tv? 
<s> i will go for that drink. 
<chandler> you got it. good woman!  could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne? 
<s> each.

<monica> oh, hi, ross. yeah. there's someone i want you to say hi to.  he just happened to call. 
<s> hi, ross. yes, it's me. how did you know?  
< 
<ross> i'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from new york to los angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.  
<s> that's funny. who are they? 
<ross> the blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend. 
<s> you mean they're lovers. 
<ross> if you wanna put a label on it. 
<s> wow, uh, anything else i should know? 
<ross> nope, nope, that's it.  
<ross> oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. i always forget that part.  helloo! 
< 
<phoebe> ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine. 
<monica> all i have is, is oregano and a fresca. 
<phoebe> um, that's ok!  ok. all right. now we need the semen of a righteous man. 
<rachel> ok, pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place. 
<monica> can we just start throwing things in? 
<phoebe> ok, yeah, ok.  oh, ok.

<s> well, um, for the past few years i've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major. 
<s> oh no. i thought you said they could shoot the spot without you. 
<s> i thought they could...i'll try to get back as soon as i can. i'm sorry.  
<ross> now that is funny. hey, do you think...would it be too weird if i invited carol over to join us? 'cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad. 
<s>  i guess. 
<ross> are you sure? great. carol? wanna come over and join us?

< looks like a half-charred picturewow, that guy's hairier than the chief! 
<monica> you know, it's a really funny story how this happened. isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control. 
<rachel> really? 
< 
<s> i brought you something. 
<chandler> is it loaded? oh, little candy hearts.  chan and jan forever.

<s> that's fine. 
<chandler>  it is? 
<s> mmm-hmm. because i know that this isn't the end. 
<chandler> oh no, you see, actually it is. 
<s> no, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. don't you know it yet? you love me, chandler bing. 
<chandler> oh, no i don't. 
<s> well then ask yourself this. why do you think we keep ending up together? new year's? who invited who? valentine's? who asked who into whose bed? 
<chandler> i did, but... 
<s> you seek me out. something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. janice, janice. you want me. you need me. you can't live without me. and you know it. you just don't know you know it. see ya.  
<chandler> call me! 
< 
<s> it's not true. i never called your mother a wolverine. 
<ross> you did so. i swear, i swear how long has she been in the bathroom? 
<s> uh, i don't think she's in the bathroom. her coat is gone. 
<ross> well maybe it's cold in there. or maybe i screwed up the first date i had in 9 years. 
<s> that could be it. 
<ross> oh, god.  you know, this is still pretty hot.  
<s> mushroom. smile. they won't all be like this. some women might even stay through dinner. sorry, that's not funny 
<ross> no, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. well, do i have to? i mean, i'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. and um, and then i'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and i don't, i don't have to...you know, here's a wacky thought. um, what's say you and i give it another shot? no no no, i know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. but what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? let's just stick a pin in it, ok? because, we're great together, you know. you can't deny it. besides, you're carrying my baby. i mean, how perfect is that? but see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. i love you.  
<s> oh, i love you too. but... 
<ross> no but, no but. 
<s> you know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? it's time to take the pin out. you'll find someone, i know you will. the right woman is just waiting for you. 
<ross> that's easy for you to say, you found one already. 
<s> all you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.  
<s> not her. closing credits

<chandler> hey! 
<s> hey! 
<phoebe> never mind. but it was going to be really good. 
<ross> what's going on? 
<s> what is it? 
<chandler> so, it's a typical day at work. i'm inputting my numbers, and big al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor. 
<s> that's great! 
<chandler> so.... i quit. 
<s> why? 
<chandler> why? this was supposed to be a temp job! 
<monica> yeah, chandler... you've been there for five years. 
<chandler> if i took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what i actually do. 
<phoebe> so was it a lot more money? 
<chandler> it doesn't matter. i just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the wenus.  
<rachel> ... the wenus? 
<chandler> weekly estimated net usage systems. a processing term. 
<rachel>  oh. that wenus. 
<joey> so what're you going to do? 
<chandler> i don't know. that's the thing. i don't know what i want to do. i just know i'm not going to figure it out working there. 
<phoebe> oooh! i have something you can do! i have this new massage client... steve?  anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef. 
<monica>  um... hi there. 
<phoebe> hi!  oh, yeah, no, i know. you're a chef. i know, and i thought of you first, but um, chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so.... 
<chandler> yeah... i just don't have that much cheffing experience. unless it's an all-toast restaurant. 
<phoebe>  yeah, yeah! 
<monica> well, what kind of food is he looking for? 
<phoebe> well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu. 
<monica>  oh my god! 
<phoebe> yeah, i know!  so, what do you think? 
<chandler> thanks, phoebe. but i just don't really see myself in a big white hat. 
<phoebe> ok.  oh monica! guess what! 
< 
<chandler> can you see my nipples through this shirt? 
<rachel> no. but don't worry, i'm sure they're still there. 
<phoebe> where are you going, mr. suity-man? 
<chandler> well, i have an appointment to see dr. robert pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  i added the "a-gogo." 
<rachel> career counselor? 
<chandler> hey, you guys all know what you want to do. 
<rachel> i don't! 
<chandler> hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. you know, you have goals. you have dreams. i don't have a dream. 
<ross> ah, the lesser-known "i don't have a dream" speech.  
<monica> oh, i love my life, i love my life! 
<phoebe> ooh! brian's song! 
<rachel> the meeting with the guy went great? 
<monica> so great! he showed me where the restaurant's going to be. it's this, it's this cute little place on 10th street. not too big, not too small. just right. 
<chandler> was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears? 
<monica> so anyway, i'm cooking dinner for him monday night. you know, kind of like an audition. and phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises. 
<rachel> what are you going to make? 
<phoebe>  yummy noises. 
<rachel>  and monica, what are you going to make? 
<monica> i don't know. i don't know. it's just going to be so great! 
<phoebe> ooh! i know what you could make!  i know! oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff?  you know, that thing... with the stuff...? ok, i don't know.  
<ross> hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood? 
<joey> how about tony's? if you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free. 
<ross> ok, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma? 
<chandler> who are you going out with? 
<phoebe> oh, is this the bug lady? 
<rachel>  bzzzz.... i love you, ross. 
<ross> her name is celia. she's not a bug lady. she's curator of insects at the museum. 
<rachel> so what are you guys going to do? 
<ross> oh, i just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and i'd introduce her to my monkey. 
<chandler> and he's not speaking metaphorically. 
<joey>  so.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe...  huh-huh? 
<ross> well, i don't know....  huh-huh.... but i'm hoping  huh-huh. 
<joey> i'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! she's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal. 
< 
<ross> celia, don't worry!  don't scream!  he's not going to hurt you! soothing tones, celia. soothing tones! marcel... 
<s> i can't stand this! he's got his claws in my... 
<ross> alright...  
< 
<monica>  ok, try this salmon mousse. 
<joey>  mmmm. good. 
<monica> is it better than the other salmon mousse? 
<joey> it's creamier. 
<monica> yeah, well, is that better? 
<joey> i don't know. we're talking about whipped fish, monica. i'm just happy i'm keeping it down, y'know?  
<rachel> my god! what happened to you?

<joey> he should take the sack? 
<ross> anyway, suddenly i'm down field, and i realise that i'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? only i know there is no way i'm gonna get there in time, so i am running, and running, and that, that is when i woke up. see i, i am so not ready to be a father. 
<chandler> hey, you're gonna be fine. you're one of the most caring, most responsible men in north america. you're gonna make a great dad. 
<joey> yeah, ross. you and the baby just need better blocking.

<s> i tell you one thing, i wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, i'd say "get out of my office!" 
<ross> dad, before i was born, did you freak out at all? 
<s> i'm not freaking out, i'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash; 
<ross> dad, dad, dad, i'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "oh my god i'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing? 
<s> no. your mother really did the work. i was busy with the business. i wasn't around that much. is that what this is about? 
<ross> no, no, dad, i was just wondering. 
<s> 'cause there's time to make up for that. we can do stuff together. you always wanted to go to that colonial williamsburg. how 'bout we do that? 
<ross> thanks, dad, really, i ju... you know, i just, i just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father? 
<s> oh, well, i, i guess it musta been the day after you were born. we were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. you were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. and you squeezed it, so tight. and that's when i knew.  
<s> so you don't wanna go to williamsburg? 
<ross> no, we can go to williamsburg.

<ross> whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'forget relationships! i'm done with men!' the whole, uh, penis embargo? 
<rachel> oh, i don't know. i guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? i mean, with barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. with paolo, that's all there was, was heat! and it was just this raw, animal, sexual... 
<ross> wait-wait. i, i got it. i was there. 
<rachel> well, i mean, do you think you can ever have both? y'know? someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl? 
<ross> yes. yes. yes! yes, i really do! in fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...

<chandler> i can't believe we are even having this discussion. 
<joey> i agree. i'm, like, in disbelief. 
<chandler> i mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with rachel, they would've happened already? 
<ross> i'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me. 
<joey> she really said that? 
<ross> well, i added the 'exactly like me' part... but she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight. 
<joey> 'tonight' tonight? 
<ross> well, i think it's perfect. y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey... 
<chandler> i can't remember the last time i got a girl to take care of my monkey. 
<ross> anyway, i figured after work i'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her. 
<chandler> hey, y'know what you should do? you should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.

<chandler> i can't believe you would actually say that. i would much rather be mr.peanut than mr.salty. 
<joey> no way! mr.salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is. 
<ross> i don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. they're craaazy. 
<monica>  oh my god. you guys! you gotta come see this! there's some creep out there with a telescope! 
<ross> i can't believe it! he's looking right at us! 
<rachel> oh, that is so sick. 
<chandler> i feel violated. and not in a good way. 
<phoebe> how can people do that?...  oh, you guys, look! ugly naked guy got gravity boots! opening credits 
< 
<chandler> i am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. it was unbelievable! we could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games... 
<monica> so have you called her yet? 
<chandler> let her know i like her? what are you, insane?  it's the next day! how needy do i want to seem?  i'm right, right? 
<monica> i can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people. 
<phoebe> oh, god, just do it!  call her! stop being so testosteroney! 
<chandler> which, by the way, is the real san francisco treat.  i got her machine. 
<joey> her answer machine? 
<chandler> no, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up. 
<phoebe> so, uh, why didn't you say anything? 
<chandler> oh, no-no-no-no. last time i left a spontaneous message i ended up using the phrase "yes indeedy-o." 
<monica> look look! it's rachel and barry. no, don't everybody look at once! 
<ross> okay, okay, what's going on? 
<phoebe> okay, they're just talking... 
<ross> yeah, well, does he look upset? does he look like he was just told to shove anything? 
<phoebe> no, no actually, he's smiling.. and... oh my god, don't do that!! 
<ross> what? what? what?! 
<phoebe> that man across the street just kicked that pigeon!  oh! 
<chandler>  and basically, that's how a bill becomes a law. 
<s> oh!... right! 
<chandler> hey rach! 
<monica> how'd it go? 
<rachel> y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. he took me to lunch at the russian tea room, and i had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out... 
<phoebe> not a good day for birds... 
<rachel> then we took a walk down to bendall's, and i told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of chanel... 
<ross> that's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm? 
<rachel> right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? it was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice! 
<ross> that's, that's nice twice! 
<monica> rachel, what's going on? i mean isn't this the same barry who you left at the altar? 
<joey> duh, where've you been? 
<rachel> yeah, but it was different with him today! and he wasn't, like, orthodontist guy, y'know? i mean, we had fun! is there anything wrong with that?  
<chandler> yes! 
<rachel> why? 
<chandler> i have my reasons. 
<monica> okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend? 
<rachel> all right. all right, all right, all right, all right, i know it's stupid! i will go see him this afternoon, and i will just put an end to it! 
< 
<rachel> wow... wow! 
<s> yeah. 
<rachel> i'm not crazy, right? i mean, it was never like that. 
<s> nooo, it wasn't. 
<rachel> ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here... 
< 
<chandler>  oh, danielle! i wasn't expecting the machine... give me a call when you get a chance.  bye-bye.  oh god! 
<monica> that's what you've been working on for the past two hours?! 
<chandler> hey, i've been honing! 
<ross> what was with the dishes? 
<chandler> oh, uh.. i want her to think i might be in a restaurant.. y'know? i might have some kind of life, like i haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours. 
<monica>  look look! he's doing it again, the guy with the telescope! 
<phoebe> oh my god!  go away!  stop looking in here! 
<monica> great, now he's waving back. 
<joey> man, we gotta do something about that guy. this morning, i caught him looking into our apartment. it creeps me out! i feel like i can't do stuff! 
<monica> what kinda stuff? 
<joey> will you grow up? i'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when i'm cooking naked. 
<phoebe> you cook naked? 
<joey> yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.  
<chandler> what are you looking at me for? i didn't know that. 
< 
<s> what's the matter? 
<rachel> oh, it's just... oh, barry, this was not good. 
<s> no, it was. it was very very good. 
<rachel> well, what about mindy? 
<s> oh, way, way better than mindy. 
<rachel> no, not that, i mean, what about you and mindy? 
<s> well, if you want, i'll justi'll just break it off with her. 
<rachel> no. no-no-no-no, no. i mean, don't do that. not, i mean not for me. 
<s>  dr. farber, bobby rush is here for his adjustment. 
<s>  thanks, bernice.  let's go away this weekend. 
<rachel> oh, barry..! come on, this is all way too.. 
<s> we can, we can go to aruba! when i went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. you would've liked it.  
<rachel> i had a bra.  
<s> hey, dr. farber.  
<s> all right miss green, everything looks fine... yep, i think we're starting to see some real progress here.  
<rachel> what?! 
<s> i'm twelve, i'm not stupid.  
< 
<chandler> can i use your phone? 
<monica> yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.  
<chandler> yes, it's working! why isn't she calling me back? 
<joey> maybe she never got your message. 
<phoebe> y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet. 
<chandler> y'don't think that makes me seem a little... 
<ross> ...desperate, needy, pathetic? 
<chandler> ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.  
<phoebe> how many beeps? 
<chandler> she answered. 
<monica> y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about. 
<chandler> i'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. now i'm needy and snubbed. god, i miss just being needy.  
<s> hey! hi! 
<phoebe> how'd he take it? 
<rachel> pretty well, actually...  
<monica>  uh, rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair? 
<rachel> oh, do i? 
<monica> uh huh. 
<rachel>  we ended up having sex in his chair. 
<monica> you had sex in his chair?!... i said that a little too loudly, didn't i? 
<ross> you-you had what? 
<phoebe> sex in his chair. 
<ross> what, uh... what were you thinking? 
<rachel> i don't know! i mean, we still care about each other. there's a history there. 's'like you and carol. 
<ross> no! no no, it is nothing like me and carol! 
<rachel> please. if she said to you, "ross, i want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?  
<chandler> if it helps, i could slide over. 
<ross> it's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! it's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- i gotta go. 
<phoebe> where are you going? 
<ross>  i just have to go, all right? do i need a reason? huh? i mean i have things to do with my life, i have a jam packed schedule, and i am late- for keeping up with it. okay?  
<chandler> hello? hello?

<s> oh god! you see, that's what i was afraid of!

<s> okay, okay... when barry was engaged to you, he and i...kind of... had a little thing on the side. 
<rachel> what? 
<s> i know. i know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to rachel," and now i feel so stupid.

< 
<joey> how could someone get a hold of your credit card number? 
<monica> i have no idea. but look how much they spent! 
<rachel> monica, would you calm down? the credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought. 
<monica> i know. it's just such reckless spending. 
<ross> i think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind. 
<chandler> wow, what a geek. they spent $69.95 on a wonder mop. 
<monica> that's me. 
<phoebe> oh! the yuk! ross, he's doing it again!  
<ross> marcel, stop humping the lamp! stop humping! now marcel, come back-  come here, marcel-

<monica> ross, you've got to do something about the humping. 
<ross> what? it's, it's just a phase.

<rachel> what? 
<monica> she's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! look at this, look. she buys tickets for plays that i wanna see. she, she buys clothes from stores that i'm intimidated by the sales people. she spent three hundred dollars on art supplies. 
<rachel> you're not an artist. 
<monica> yeah, well i might be if i had the supplies! i mean, i could do all this stuff. only i don't. 
<rachel> oh, monica, c'mon, you do cool things. 
<monica> oh really? okay, let's compare, shall we. 
<rachel>  oh, it's so late for 'shall we'... 
<monica> do i go horseback riding in the park? do i take classes at the new school?

<monica> this is so unfair! she's got everything i want, and she doesn't have my mother.

<chandler> how about joey... pepponi? 
<joey> no, still too ethnic. my agent thinks i should have a name that's more neutral.

<joey> stalin...stalin...do i know that name? it sounds familiar. 
<chandler> well, it does not ring a bell with me...

<monica> this woman's got my life, i should get to see who she is. 
<rachel> go to the post office! i'm sure her picture's up! ...okay, monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! i mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing. 
<phoebe> this is madness. it's madness, i tell you, for the love of god, monica, don't do it!! ...thank you. 
< 
<monica> what d'you think? 
<phoebe> lotsa things.  
<rachel> which one do you think she is?  
<s> may i help you?

<rachel> what does she mean? 
<phoebe> i think she means  'you dance a dance class'. oh, c'mon, c'mon.  
<monica> okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me? 
<s>  people! last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. let's not have that happen again!

<rachel> what? you just click when they click. 
<s> alright people, now everyone grab a partner.  
<phoebe> okay. and, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. i'm with rachel.

<ross>  hi. 
<joey> where've you been? 
<ross> at the vet. 
<chandler> she's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she? 
<ross> she says marcel's humping thing's not a phase. apparently he's reached sexual maturity. 
<joey>  hey! he beat ya. 
<ross> she says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent. 
<chandler> so what does this mean? 
<ross> i'm gonna have to give him up. commercial break 
< 
<joey> i can't believe it, ross. this sucks! 
<chandler> i don't get it, i mean, you just got him. how can he be an adult already? 
<ross> i know. i know. i mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing i can't get off my leg. 
<joey> isn't there any way you can keep him? 
<ross> no, no. the vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. i've just gotta get him into a zoo. 
<joey> how do you get a monkey into a zoo? 
<chandler> i know that one! ...no, that's popes into a volkswagen. 
<ross> well, we're applying to a lot of them. naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, san diego... right? but that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at miami, so that's a possibility. 
<chandler> yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. i mean, it's a total party zoo.  
<phoebe> hey. we found her, we found the girl. 
<chandler> what? 
<joey> did you call the cops? 
<rachel> nope. we took her to lunch. 
<chandler> ah. your own brand of vigilante justice. 
<ross> what?! are you insane? this woman stole from you. she stole. she's a stealer. 
<monica> y'know what? after you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. i mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit. 
<ross> yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader. 
<chandler> ...take off their hats! 
<phoebe> popes in a volkswagen! ...i love that joke. 
< 
<rachel> no way. no way did you do this. 
<monica> it was so wild. we told them we were the gunnersens in room six fifteen. only to find out the boston celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor! have breasts... 
<monica> ...they threw us out! i was thrown out of a hotel! me! 
<rachel> go monana! well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. i get to go pour coffee for people i don't know. don't wait up.  
<monica> 'scuse me? memories and make complete fools of ourselves. whaddya say? 
<monica> nononononono. think who you're dealing with here. i mean, i'm not like you. i-i can't even stand in front of a tap class. 
<monica> what? 
<monica> right. till i bought a blow dryer, then i was shunned. changed my life. did you ever see dead poets' society? 
<monica> uh-huh. i mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? what was that?! it's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. i walked out of there and i thought, 'now, that's two hours of my life that i'm never getting back.' and that thought scared me more than all the other crap i was afraid to do.

<phoebe> remembered what? 
<rachel> it was like months ago. we were walking by this antique store, and i saw this pin in the window, and i told him it was just like one my grandmother had when i was a little girl. oh! i can't believe he remembered! 
<chandler> well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?  
<phoebe> oh, it's so pretty. this must have cost him a fortune. 
<monica> i can't believe he did this.

<chandler> ok, is there a mute button on this woman? 
<monica> i think this is so great! i mean, you and ross! d-did you have any idea? 
<rachel> no! none! i mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something did he say? i mean, does he, like, want to go out with me? 
<joey> well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something. 
<rachel> ross? all this time? well, i've got to talk to him.  
<chandler>  h-he's in china! 
<joey> the country. 
<monica> no, no, wait.  his flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.

<chandler> yes!  you're never gonna make it! 
<monica> rachel, what're you gonna say to him? 
<rachel> i-i-i don't know. 
<chandler> well then maybe you shouldn't go. 
<joey> he's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait. 
<monica> yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now. 
<rachel> i don't know. maybe i'll know when i see him.

<joey> how do you mean? 
<s> i don't know, i-i guess i just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' but you... you're a giver. you're like the most generous man i ever met. i mean... you're practically a woman. 
< 
<monica> uh, so, uh, rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, i mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with ross or should i just throw it out? 
<rachel> i don't know. i don't know... i thought about it all the way there, and i thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's ross. y'know what i mean? i mean, it's ross. 
<rachel> i don't know, i mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but i'm thinking... oh, i'm thinking it'd be really great. 
<monica> oh my god, me too! oh! oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! y'know what the best part is? the best part is that you already know everything about him! i mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date! 
<phoebe> yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date. 
<monica> another good point. 
<phoebe> no, i mean, i mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. y'know, it's... you're committed. 
<rachel>  huh? 
<phoebe> well, i mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out? 
<monica> why isn't it working out? 
<rachel> i don't know... sometimes it doesn't. 
<monica> is he not cute enough for you? 
<rachel> no! 
<monica> does he not make enough money? 
<rachel> no, i'm just.... 
<phoebe> maybe there's someone else. 
<rachel> wha... 
<monica> is there? is there someone else? 
<rachel> no! there is.. there is noone else! 
<monica> then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?

<chandler> hey, big... 
<joey> shhhh! 
<chandler>  ...spender. 
<joey> she's still asleep. 
<chandler> so how'd it go? 
<joey> oh, it was amazing. you know how you always think you're great in bed? 
<chandler> the fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me. 
<joey> well, it's like, last night, i couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. so i had to do all this other stuff. and the response i got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade! 
<chandler> yes, i know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route. 
<joey> it was amazing! and not just for her... uh-uh. for me, too. it's like, all of a sudden, i'm blind. but all my other senses are heightened, y'know? it's like... i was able to appreciate it on another level. 
<chandler> i didn't know you had another level. 
<joey> i know! neither did i! 
< 
<monica> hey, great skirt! birthday present? 
<rachel> yeah. 
<monica> oh, from who? 
<rachel> from you. i exchanged the blouse you got me. 
<monica> well, it's the thought. hey, doesn't ross's flight get in in a couple hours? at gate 27-b? 
<rachel> uh, yeah. uh, monica, y'know, honey, i've been thinking about it and i've decided thisthis whole ross thing, it's just not a good idea. 
<monica> oh, why? 
<rachel> because, i feel like i wouldn't just be going out with him. i would be going out with all of you. oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and i don't wanna... 
<monica>  no, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure! 
<rachel> monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so... 
<monica> i am not 'so'! ok, i was a teensy bit weird at first, but... i'll be good. i promise.  
<rachel> who is it?

<joey> seven hundred bucks! 
<chandler> alright, you did it! do we have any fruit? 
<joey> man, hell of a two weeks, huh? y'know what, though? i really feel like i learned something. 
<chandler> really? so, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?

<ross> fine, just stop thinking about me.  
<ross> can't do it, can you? 
<rachel> so i'm thinking about you. so what?

<rachel> well... he happens to be a very nice... guy.... 
<s> i mean, come on, buddy, get a real car! 
<ross> rachel, come on. give us a chance. 
<rachel> ross, it's too hard. 
<ross> no, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? who cares about them. this is about us. look, i-i've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade. 
<rachel> ross, you're like my best friend. 
<ross> i know. 
<rachel> if we broke up, and i lost you... 
<ross> whoa, whoa, whoa. what makes you think we're gonna break up? 
<rachel> well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up? 
<ross>  no. but... it only has to happen once. look, you and i both know we are perfect for each other, right? i mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me? 
<rachel> i don't know... i mean, i've never looked at you that way before. 
<ross> well, start looking.  
<rachel> wow. 
<s> exactly! and you just know i'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic! 
<rachel> right! you're right! 
<s> heh... y'know?

<ross> no, no, they will. i just... uh... 
<ross> come on, they're gonna love you. [cut to a close-up of rachel, eagerly awaiting ross's arrival... not phillips 
< 
<phoebe> ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. ross was in love with rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and italian guys. finally chandler was like "forget about her" but when ross was in china on his dig, chandler let it slip that ross was in love with rachel. she was like, "oh my god." so she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that ross was getting off the plane with another woman. uh-oh! so, that's pretty much everything you need to know. but, enough about us. so, how've you been? opening credits  
<rachel> oh my god. oh my god.  excuse me. move! move! emergency! excuse me!  
<ross>  rach! 
<rachel> oh, there you are! hi! oh, so, so, how was china, you?  
<ross> it was, it was great. oh, what happened? 
<rachel> what? 
<ross> you're bleeding. 
<rachel> i am? oh, look at that, yes i am. enough about me, enough about me, mr. back from the orient. come on. i wanna hear everything! everything.  
<ross> well, where do i start? this is julie. julie, this is rachel.

<chandler>  no way! 
<monica> i'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with ross! 
<phoebe> oh my god. this is huge. this is bigger than huge. this is like, all right, what's bigger than huge? 
<joey> um, this? 
<phoebe> yes. 
<monica> guys, you got your hair cut. 
<chandler> yes, yes, we did, thanks to vidal buffay.

<rachel>  airport, airport. ross, not alone, julie, arm around her. cramp, cramp. 
<chandler> ok, i think she's trying to tell us something. quick, get the verbs.  
<rachel>  you, you, you said he liked me.  you, you slowpokes! 
<ross> that's all right, rach, we got the bags. hi, hello. julie, this is my sister monica. this is chandler.  phoebe.  joey, what up?

<ross> 200 at least. 
<s>  ...and this guy... 
<rachel> and the chicken pooped in her lap. oh, i'm so sorry. i just gave away the ending, didn't i? oh! it's just, i just heard this story in the cab, and it is all i can think about. 
<monica> this is amazing. i mean, how, how did this happen? 
<s> well, ross and i were in grad school together. 
<ross> but we haven't seen each other since then. well i land in china, guess who's in charge of the dig. 
<rachel> julie! julie, isn't that great? i mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic? 
<monica>  it's an expression. 
<ross> well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby. 
<s> and then we've gotta get some sleep. 
<ross> yeah, it's really tomorrow night our time. 
<chandler> well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause i like to be surprised.

<ross> thank you. 
<chandler> hey, rach, can i get... 
<rachel> did you talk to him? 
<chandler> not yet. 
<rachel> then, no.  
<chandler> so what the hell happened to you in china? i mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know. 
<ross> i know, i know i was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. you know whose voice that was? 
<chandler> god? 
<ross> it was you, pal. 
<chandler> well, maybe it was god, doing me. 
<ross> look, you were right. she looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. but then i met julie, and i don't know, we're havin' a great time. and i have to say, i never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you. 
<chandler> well, you owe me one, big guy. 
<rachel>  here's your lemonade. 
<ross> i didn't order lemonade. 
<rachel> oh. well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that. 
<ross> but... 
<rachel> go-go-go-go, come on!  so uh, what did you find out? 
<chandler> he said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. i'm sorry. but, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself!  without any outside help whatsoever. 
<rachel> how is that the silver lining? 
<chandler> you have to really wanna see it. 
< 
<ross> ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.  
<monica> pheebes, you know what i'm thinking? 
<phoebe> oh, ok. how, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it? 
<monica> no, although now that's what i'm thinking. 
<phoebe> all right, so what were you thinking? 
<monica> well, i was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, i thought, maybe you'd like to do mine? 
<phoebe> ohh! no. 
<monica> why not? 
<phoebe> because, i'm just, i'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak. 
<monica> no you're not. 
<phoebe> i know i'm not, but you are, and i was trying to spare your feelings.  
<joey>  hello? oh, hi. yeah, hold on a second. ross, it's julie, for you.

<rachel> i don't know, i just kinda ran into him last night. 
<phoebe> where? 
<rachel> at his apartment. is this juice? 
<joey> whoa, whoa. and the fact that you dumped him because he hit on phoebe? 
<rachel> oh god, i know i'm a pathetic loser. 
<monica> honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad. 
<chandler> people do stupid things when they're upset. 
<monica> my god, if i had a nickel for every guy i wish i hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.  
<s> hi! 
<ross> hi. sorry we're late but we werewell, there was touching. 
<s>  hey, hey ross. 
<ross> hey, paulo. what are you doing here? 
<s> i do raquel.

<rachel> yeah, he's back. is that a problem? 
<ross> no, not a problem. 
<rachel> good! i'm glad it's not a problem. 
<phoebe>  ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass. 
<chandler> well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, i've got pants that need to be altered. 
<joey> hey, chandler, when you see frankie, tell him joey tribbiani says hello. he'll know what it means. 
<chandler> are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code? 
<monica>  you know it's funny, the last time paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter. 
<phoebe> all right. ok, but, but!  you have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and monica about it. 
<monica> i promise. 
<phoebe> all right.  now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. but i promise none of you are gonna feel a thing. 
< 
<phoebe> all right, that's it, i quit. 
<monica> what? i didn't say anything. 
<phoebe> yeah, but this  isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. ok, this  is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person. 
<monica> i'm sorry. i'm sorry, phoebe. it's just a little shorter than what we had discussed. 
<phoebe> would you relax? i know what i am doing. this is how he wears it. 
<monica> how who wears it? 
<phoebe> demi moore. 
<monica> demi moore is not a he. 
<phoebe> well, he was a he in arthur, and in ten. 
<monica> that's dudley moore. i said i wanted it like demi moore. 
<phoebe> oh.  oh! 
<monica> oh my god! 
<phoebe> oh my god!

<phoebe> oh, she's got gorgeous hair. 
<monica> i know!

<s> how long do you want the cuffs? 
<chandler> at least as long as i have the pants.  
<s> i just got that. ok, now we'll do your inseam.  
< 
<rachel> how is she? 
<phoebe> it's too soon to tell. she's resting, which is a good sign. 
<ross> how's the hair? 
<phoebe> i'm not gonna lie to you, ross, it doesn't look good. i put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling. 
<joey> can we see her? 
<phoebe> your hair looks too good, i think it would upset her. ross, why don't you come on in. 
<ross>  yeah.   
<joey> how're you doing? 
<rachel> i'm okay. 
<joey> ooh, that bad, huh? 
<rachel> what? 
<joey> look, i can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. it's one of my gifts. 
<rachel> when i saw him get off that plane with her, i really thought i hit rock bottom. but today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me. 
<joey> you gotta tell ross how you feel. 
<rachel> come on. how can i just tell him? what about julie? 
<joey> what about her? they've only been going out for two weeks. ross has been in love with you for like 10 years. 
<rachel> i don't know, i don't know. 
<joey> look, rach, rach! i've been with my share of women. in fact, i've been with like a lot of people's share of women. the point is, i've never felt about anyone the way ross felt about you. 
<chandler>  yo, paisan! can i talk to you for a sec?  your tailor is a very bad man! 
<joey> frankie? what're you talking about? 
<ross>  hey, what's goin' on?  
<chandler> joey's tailor...took advantage of me. 
<ross> what? 
<joey> no way. i've been going to the guy for 12 years. 
<chandler> oh come on! he said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite... 
<ross> what? 
<chandler> cupping. 
<joey> that's how they do pants! first they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear.  what? ross, ross, would you tell him? isn't that how they measure pants? 
<ross> yes, yes it is. in prison! whatsa matter with you? 
<joey> what? that's not?  oh my god. 
< 
<monica> even mary tyler moore would've been better. 
<ross> i like it. i do, i think it's a ten.  
<monica> thank you. my hair is very amused. 
<chandler> come on, monica, things could be worse. you could get caught between the moon and new york city. i know it's crazy, but it's true. 
<phoebe>  thank you. 
<ross> well, i gotta go. bye. bye, rach. 
<rachel>  wait, are you leaving? 
<ross> yeah, that's kinda what i meant by "bye!" 
<rachel> well, can i talk to you for a sec? 
<ross> okay.  
<joey> hey, when the doctor does that hernia test... 
<chandler> that's ok.  
<ross> what's goin' on? 
<rachel> well, first of all, paulo and i are not back together. it was just a stupid thing i did, and if i could go back in time and do it again, well, i wouldn't. um, second of all , what? 
<ross> ok. well, before i say anything, i just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then i tell you what i think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and i look like a complete idiot? 
<rachel> no. no-no-no-no. 
<ross> well, then, i think, i think the guy is scum. i hate him. i mean i actuallyi-i physically hate him. i always have. you are way too good to be with a guy like that. 
<rachel> really? 
<ross> you deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? someone who wakes up every morning thinking "oh my god, i'm with rachel". you know, someone who makes you feel good, the way i am with julie.  was there a second of all? 
<rachel> no, i think that was the whole all. 
<ross> okay.  okay.  okay.  
<joey> i swear to god, dad. that's not how they measure pants. closing credits

<rachel> ok, monica. i just have to know one thing. did you go with her to bloomingdale's?  oh! ok, ok, ok, i just really, uh, i just really need to not be with you right now.  commercial break 
< 
<monica>  hi, who's this?  hi, joanne. is rachel working? it's monica.  yes, i know i did a horrible thing.  joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok?  no, i don't care what steve thinks.  hi, steve.  
<s> how did we do? 
<phoebe> oh, i tasted ben's milk, and ross freaked out. 
<ross> i did not freak out. 
<s> why'd you freak out? 
<ross> because it's breast milk. it's gross. 
<s> my breast milk is gross? 
<s> this should be fun. 
<ross> no, no, carol. there's nothing wrong with it. i just, i just don't think breast milk is for adults. 
<chandler> of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike. 
<s> ross, you're being silly. i've tried it, it's no big deal. just taste it.  
<ross>  that would be no. 
<phoebe> come on. it doesn't taste bad. 
<joey> yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh... 
<s> cantaloupe juice. 
<joey> exactly. 
<ross>  you've tasted it? you've tasted it. 
<s> uh huh. 
<ross> oh, you've tasted it. 
<s> you can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true. 
<ross>  gimme the bottle.  gimme the towel.  
< 
<chandler> howdy. 
<joey>  gimme a box a juice. well, they switched me over to hombre. 
<chandler> well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed. 
<joey> or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it.  you should see this guy, chandler, he goes through two bottles a day. 
<chandler>  what do you care? you're an actor. this is your day job. this isn't supposed to mean anything to you. 
<joey> i know, but, i was the best, you know? i liked being the best.  i don't know. maybe i should just get outta the game. they need guys up in housewares to serve cheese. 
<chandler>  all right, say you do that. you know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. and then where're you gonna run? 
<joey> yeah i guess you're right. 
<chandler> you're damn right i'm right. i say you show this guy what you're made of. i say you stand your ground. i say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie. 
<joey> i'm gonna do it.  
<chandler> all right. now go see miss kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker. 
< 
<monica> i don't know what else to say. 
<rachel> well that works out good, because i'm not listening. 
<monica> i feel terrible, i really do. 
<rachel> oh, i'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife? 
<monica> rachel,  say that i'm friends with her, we spend some time together. is that so terrible? 
<rachel> yes. 
<monica> it's that terrible? 
<rachel> yes. monica, you don't get it. it's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that i am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you. 
<monica> me? what are you talking about? nobody could steal me from you. i mean, just because i'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. i mean,  you're my...we're, we're...oh, i love you. 
<rachel> i love you too.  
<phoebe> you guys, um i know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um i love you guys too.  oh, i really needed that.  
<monica> look, i know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. i mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. i really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. would you just give that a chance, for me? 
<rachel>  i'd do anything for you, you know that. 
<monica>  i'd do anything for you.  
<phoebe> wait, wait, wait, wait!  
< 
<joey> mornin'.  i said, mornin'. 
<joey> yeah, i'm ready.  
<s> you idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, i'm suing! 
<s>  my god, what happened? 
<joey> these new kids, they never last. sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. listen, uh, what do you say i buy you that cup of coffee now? 
<s> sure.  
< 
<s> so. 
<rachel> so. i just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. i mean, you know, we've never really talked. i guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right? 
<s> i know, i probably shouldn't even tell you this, but i'm pretty much totally intimidated by you. 
<rachel> really? me? 
<s> yes. oh my god, are you kidding? ross is so crazy about you, and i really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but i kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't. 
<rachel> well, you're not totally paranoid. 
<s> oy. 
<rachel> um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which i'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, i just, i see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, monica's always saying how nice you are, and god i hate it when she's right. 
<s> thanks. hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something? 
<rachel> yeah, that'd be great. i'd love it. 
<s> i'd love it too. shoot, i gotta go. so, i'll talk to you later. 
<rachel> all right, julie.

<chandler>  hey. 
<s> hey! 
<monica> so how was joan? 
<chandler> i broke up with her. 
<ross> dont tell me, because of the big nostril thing? 
<chandler> they were huge. when she sneezed, bats flew out of them. 
<rachel> come on, they were not that huge. 
<chandler> i'm tellin' you, she leaned back; i could see her brain. 
<monica> how many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things? 
<joey> hold it, hold it. i gotta side with chandler on this one. when i first moved to the city, i went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest adam's apple. it made me nuts. 
<chandler>  you or me? 
<ross> i got it. uh, joey, women don't have adam's apples. 
<joey> you guys are messing with me, right? 
<s> yeah. 
<joey> that was a good one. for a second there, i was like, "whoa." opening credits 
< 
<phoebe> you name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason. 
<chandler> maureen rosilla. 
<ross> "cause she doesnt hate yanni," is not a real reason.  
<monica>  hello, mr._heckles. 
<s> you're doing it again. 
<monica> we're not doing anything. 
<s> you're stomping. it's disturbing my birds. 
<rachel> you don't have birds. 
<s> i could have birds. 
<monica> okay, mr._heckles, we'll try to keep it down. 
<s> thank you. i'm going to rejoin my dinner party. 
<rachel> all right, bye-bye.  
<chandler> okay, janice. janice. you gotta give me janice. that wasn't about being picky. 
<ross> we'll give you janice. 
<phoebe> i miss janice though.  "hello, chandler bing." 
<rachel>  "oh, my, god." 
<joey>  "oh, chandler, now, now, that's it. there, faster!"   
<monica> stop with the broom, we're not making noise.  
<rachel> we won. we won!  
<monica> mr._heckles. 
<rachel> how did this happen? 
<s> he musta been sweeping. they found a broom in his hand. 
<monica> that's terrible. 
<s> i know. i was sweeping yesterday. it coulda been me. 
<ross> sure, you coulda. you never know. 
<s> you never know. 
< 
<phoebe> ok, it's very faint, but i can still sense him in the building.  go into the light, mr._heckles! 
<chandler> ok, phoebe. 
<phoebe> i'm sorry, but sometimes they need help.  that's fine. go ahead and scoff. you know there're a lot of things that i don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true. 
<joey> such as? 
<phoebe> like crop circles, or the bermuda triangle, or evolution? 
<ross> whoa, whoa, whoa. what, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution? 
<phoebe> nah. not really. 
<ross> you don't believe in evolution? 
<phoebe> i don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, i just think it's a little too easy. 
<ross> too easy? too...the process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, is-is too easy? 
<phoebe> yeah, i just don't buy it. 
<ross> uh, excuse me. evolution is not for you to buy, phoebe. evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity. 
<phoebe> ok, don't get me started on gravity. 
<ross> you uh, you don't believe in gravity? 
<phoebe> well, it's not so much that you know, like i don't believe in it, you know, it's just...i don't know, lately i get the feeling that i'm not so much being pulled down as i am being pushed.  
<chandler> uh-oh. it's isaac newton, and he's pissed.  
<s> there she is. and over there, that's the other one. this is mr. buddy boyle, mr._heckles' attorney. he'd like to talk to you. 
<monica> what can we do for you? wants to leave all his earthly possessions to "the noisy girls in the apartment above mine." 
<monica> well, what about his family? 
<rachel> ok, so let's talk money. noisy girl number one,  you be noisy girl number two. 
<monica> i can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. i mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it? 
< 
<monica> would you look at this dump? he hated us. this is his final revenge! 
<rachel> have you ever seen so much crap? 
<chandler> actually, i think this apartment sullies the good name of crap 
<joey> check this out. can i have this?   
<ross> how can you not believe in evolution? 
<phoebe> just don't. look at this funky shirt! 
<ross> pheebs, i have studied evolution my entire adult life. ok, i can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? you can literally see them evolving through time. 
<phoebe> really? you can actually see it? 
<ross> you bet. in the u.s., china, africa, all over. 
<phoebe> see, i didn't know that. 
<ross> well, there you go. 
<phoebe> huh. so now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why? 
<chandler>  hey, look at this. "my big book of grievances." 
<joey> hey, there's me! april 17th. excessive noise. italian guy comes homes with a date. hey chandler, look, you're in here too. 
<chandler> april 18th, excessive noise. italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. well that's excellent. 
<rachel> monica, monica, look at this lamp.  is this tacky or what? we have to have this. 
<monica> rache, i think we have enough regular lamps. 
<rachel> what? come on, it's not like i'm asking for this girlie clock or anything, which, by the way, i also think is very cool.  
<monica> it doesn't go with any of my stuff. 
<rachel> well, what about my stuff? 
<monica> you don't have any stuff. 
<rachel> you still think of it as your apartment, don't you? 
<monica> no. 
<rachel> yes you do. you think of it as your apartment, and i'm just somebody who rents a room. 
<monica> mmmmm. 
<rachel> ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, i'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp. 
<ross> ok, pheebs.  see how i'm making these little toys move? opposable thumbs. without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs? 
<phoebe> maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts. 
<ross> please tell me you're joking. 
<phoebe> look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and i don't. 
<ross> no, no, pheebs, we can't, ok, because 
<phoebe> what is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? no, what's that all about? i think, i think maybe it's time you put ross under the microscope. 
<ross>  is there blood coming out of my ears? 
<joey> check it out, check it out. heckles' high school yearbook. 
<chandler> wow, he looks so normal. 
<phoebe> he's even kind of cute. 
<joey> "heckles, you crack me up in science class. you're the funniest kid in school." 
<chandler> funniest? heckles? 
<joey> that's what it says. 
<chandler> wow, heckles was voted class clown, and so was i.  he was right. would you listen to that? 
<phoebe> i'd call that excessive. 
<chandler> whoa! 
<joey> what? 
<chandler> heckles played clarinet in band, and i played clarinet. and he was in the scale modelers club, and i was, well, there was no club, but i sure thought they were cool. 
<joey> so, you were both dorks. big deal. 
<chandler> i just think it's weird, you know?  heckles and me, heckles, and me, me and heckles  would you knock it off?  bah!  commercial break 
< 
<joey>  have you been here all night? 
<chandler> look at this. pictures of all the women that heckles went out with. look what he wrote on them.  vivian, too tall. madge, big gums. too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. this is, this is me. this is what i do. i'm gonna end up alone, just like he did. 
<joey> chandler, heckles was a nut case. 
<chandler> our trains are on the same track, ok? yeah, sure, i'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. bitter town. aloneville. hermit junction. 
<joey> all right, you know what we gotta do? we gotta get you outta here. come on, i'll buy you breakfast, let's go. 
<chandler> what if i never find someone? or worse, what if i've found her, but i dumped her because she pronounced it supposably? 
<joey> chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody. 
<chandler> how do you know that? how? 
<joey> i don't know, i'm just tryin' to help you out. 
<chandler> you'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and i'm gonna end up alone. will you promise me something? when you're married, will you invite me over for holidays? 
<joey> well, i don't know. i don't know what we're gonna be doin'. i mean, what if we're at her folks' place? 
<chandler> yeah, i understand. 
<joey> you can come over and watch the super bowl. every year, all right? 
<chandler> you know what? i'm not gonna end up like this. i'll see you man.

<s> oh, my, god.

<phoebe> janice? you called janice? 
<chandler> yes, janice. why is that so difficult for you to comprehend? 
<ross> you remember janice, right? 
<chandler> yes. she was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. janice is my last chance to have somebody. 
<s>  helloo!!

<rachel> monica, let it go. 
<monica> did you know i was allergic to shellfish? 
<rachel> well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.  
<phoebe> uh-oh. it's scary scientist man. 
<ross> ok, phoebe, this is it. in this briefcase i carry actual scientific facts. a briefcase of facts, if you will. some of these fossils are over 200 million years old. 
<phoebe> ok, look, before you even start, i'm not denying evolution, ok, i'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities. 
<ross> it's the only possibility, phoebe. 
<phoebe> ok, ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok?  wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? and, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?  
<ross> there might be a teeny tiny possibility. 
<phoebe> i can't believe you caved. 
<ross> what? 
<phoebe> you just abandoned your whole belief system. i mean, before, i didn't agree with you, but at least i respected you. how, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? how, how are you going to face the other science guys? how, how are you going to face yourself?  oh! that was fun. so who's hungry? 
<rachel> i am. let me just get my coat.  
<rachel>  what happened?! what happened?! 
<monica> ok, all right. it was an accident, i swear, all right. i was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke. 
<rachel> oh, please, monica. you've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken? 
<monica> phoebe, tell her! 
<phoebe> ok, i didn't see it, because i was putting on my jacket, but i uh want to believe you.  
<rachel> hey chandler. monica just broke my seashell lamp. 
<chandler> neat. i'm gonna die alone. 
<rachel> ok, you win. 
<monica> chandler, you're not gonna die alone. 
<chandler> janice was my safety net, ok? and now i have to get a snake. 
<phoebe> uh huh. why is that? 
<chandler> if i'm gonna be an old, lonely man, i'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. so i figure i'll be crazy man with a snake, yknow. crazy snake man. and i'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "run away from crazy snake man," they'll shout! 
<monica> you have got to get over this. you're not gonna end up alone. 
<chandler> of course i am. i reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then i bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there. 
<rachel> chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with. 
<monica> you are not a freak. you're a guy. 
<rachel> she's right. she's right. you are no different than the rest of them. 
<monica> wait a minute, wait a minute. yes he is. you are totally different. 
<chandler> in a bad way? 
<monica> no, honey, in a wonderful way. you know what you want now. most guys don't even have a clue. you are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone. 
<rachel> yeah. you're not gonna end up alone. 
<phoebe> chandler, you called janice! that's how much you wanted to be with someone! 
<monica> you made it! 
<phoebe> you're there! 
<rachel> you are ready to make a commitment! 
<chandler> whoa! don't know about that.

<rachel> what you got there? something else that's not yours that you can break? 
<monica> no. um, i know you like this, and i want you to have it. i think it'll look good in our apartment.

<monica> that's fine. 
<chandler> hey. well, you will all be pleased to know that i have a date tomorrow night. this woman alison, from work, she's great. she's pretty. she's smart. and uh, i've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. but, i'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. look at me. i'm growing. 
<joey> hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you? 
<chandler> i'll take that. 
<joey> you want his yearbook? 
<chandler> yeah, yeah. some people said some nice things about him. i think somebody should have it. 
<monica> oh, gosh, this is so weird. i mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. you know, i think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for mr._heckles. i mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but he was a person. you're all going to hell. 
<rachel> it's really not that big!  
<chandler>  takin' that with you, huh?

<phoebe> oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything. 
<monica> what have i not told you? 
<phoebe> oh, i don't know. umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with fun bobby out on the terrace. 
<rachel> what!  
<monica> wait a minute, who told you?  you are dead meat. 
<chandler> i didn't know it was a big secret.

<chandler>  you bitch. 
<ross> whip it out, whip it out. 
<phoebe> yeah!  yeah!  yeah!

<joey> i can't believe you. you told me it was a nubbin. 
<ross> joey, what did you think a nubbin was?

<monica> that is wild. 
<ross>  so what's it shaped like? 
<phoebe> yeah, is there a hair on it? 
<joey> what happens if you flick it? 
< 
<ross> so, uh, does it do anything, you know, special? 
<chandler> why yes ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of narnia. 
<s> you know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. you get the best huts and women dance naked around you. 
<chandler> huh? are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area? 
<ross> you know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know? 
<rachel>  ooh, julie's so smart, julie's so special.

<phoebe> i, i don't, i don't understand, how can you be straight? i mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great academy award parties. 
<s> i know, that's what i kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore. 
<phoebe> so how long have you known? 
<s> well i guess on some level i always knew i was straight. i though i was supposed to be something else, you know, i'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, i was just tryin' to fit in. 
<phoebe> and um, and there's actually a, a woman? 
<s> her name's debra. 
<phoebe> oh. well is she, is she the first that you've been with? 
<s> well, i've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when i'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. but i, i, i told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college. 
<phoebe> sure. 
<s> but now i know i don't have a choice about this, i was born this way. 
<phoebe> i, i don't know what to say. i mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'oh, i'm not gay.' 
<s> i'm, i'm still me. 
<phoebe> why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago? 
< 
<monica> you know, it still smells like monkey in there. 
<s> that saves us a conversation. 
<chandler> well, listen, this has been great but i'm officially wiped. 
<joey> me too, we should get goin'. 
<rachel> no, no, i mean, no, c'mon you guys, i mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore. 
<monica> rachel, that's all we do. 
<rachel> maybe that's all we do, what about julie?

<rachel> well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. i mean, who is julie? i mean, what do you like, what don't you like? we wanna hear everything.

<phoebe> so, um, have you told your parents? 
<s> no, but it'll be ok, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . . 
<phoebe>  here you go. you know what, i just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, i had been around, do you think that i would have been the one who. . . no, um, i'm sorry, don't tell me, i don't think either answer would make me feel better. 
<s> i love you phoebe.  
<phoebe> so your brother's straigh huh? seriously.

<ross> um, no, i uh, i have done it before. 
<rachel> uh, ok, i mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. i mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce? 
<ross> i uh, i don't know, i guess i'm just gonna see, see what happens. 
<rachel> ok, gook luck. 
<ross> wha, uhh, what? 
<rachel> nothing, i mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from. 
<ross> ok, now i'm nervous. 
<rachel> maybe you should put it off. 
<ross> no, no, i don't wanna put it off, i just, god i just, i spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now i'm actually happy. you know, i mean, really happy. i just, i just don't wanna, i don't wanna mess it up, ya know. 
<rachel> i know, yeah, sorry. 
<ross> what, it's not your fault. 
<rachel> maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. i mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. i mean, women really like that. 
<ross> really? 
<rachel> yeah, i mean, you know it, i mean, if it were me i, i, you know, i'd want you to, i don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen. 
<ross>  uh-huh. 
<rachel> and then, i don't know, i mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that i'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. and, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening. 
<ross> ohh. . . thanks rach, goodnight.  
<rachel> ohh, god. closing credits 
< 
<ross> good morning.

<ross> you ever figure out what that thing's for? 
<chandler> no, see, i'm trying this new screening thing. you know, i figure if i'm always answering the phone, people'll think i don't have a life. my god, rodrigo never gets pinned. 
<s>  here comes the beep, you know what to do. if you're still at this number, but i was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, i know it's been three years, but, i was kinda hoping we could hook up again. i barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what i did? 
<chandler> what? 
<s> i got a little drunk...and naked. 
<chandler>  bob here. opening credits 
<

<s> great, i'll see you then. 
<chandler> ok.  ok. having a phone has finally paid off. 
<ross> even though you do do a good bob impression, i'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not bob." 
<chandler> i'm hoping that when bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table. 
<ross> oh my god. you are pure evil. 
<chandler> ok, pure evil , horny and alone . i've done this  
< 
<ross> yeah, yeah, everybody's here. hey, everybody, say hi to julie in new mexico.

<phoebe> can you believe how much this is gonna cost? 
<rachel> do you guys ever get the feeling that um, chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do? 
<joey> yes! yeah, it's like they're always saying "let's go here, let's go there". like we can afford to go here and there. 
<phoebe> yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, y'know, someplace nice, y'know? god, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for ross.

<chandler> oh, see, i had to tell her that my number was your number, because i couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is bob's number.

<rachel> that's 'cause you have it. 
<ross> that's a good point. 
<chandler> so um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before? 
<joey> 'cause it's always somethin', you know, like with monica's new job, or the whole ross's birthday hoopla. 
<ross> whawhoa, hey, i don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negativethere's gonna be a hoopla? 
<rachel> basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing. 
<monica> if it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift. 
<ross> g-gift? the thing's not the gift? 
<chandler> no, the thing was, we were gonna go see hootie and the blowfish. 
<ross> hootie and theoh my. i, i can catch them on the radio.

<ross> whoo! 
<phoebe> cool. 
<monica> yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank you. 
<ross> but wait, there's more. hey, chandler, what is in the envelope? 
<chandler>  by the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall. 
<ross> come on. 
<chandler> why, it's six tickets to hootie and the blowfish!  the blowfish! 
<monica> it's on us, all right, so don't worry. it's our treat. 
<phoebe> so...thank you. 
<ross> could you be less enthused? 
<joey> look, it's a nice gesture, it is. but it just feels like... 
<monica> like? 
<joey> charity. 
<monica> charity? 
<ross> we're just tryin' to do a nice thing here. 
<rachel> ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.  
<phoebe> actually, it makes us feel that big.  
<ross> i don't, i don't understand. i mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys. 
<chandler> if you guys feel this big , maybe that's not our fault. maybe that's just how you feel. 
<joey> oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel. 
<rachel> ok, we never shoulda talked about this. 
<phoebe> i'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause i'm just not in a very hootie place right now. 
<rachel> me neither. 
<joey> me too. 
<monica> guys, we bought the tickets. 
<phoebe> oh, well, then you'll have extra seats y'know, for all your tiaras and stuff. 
<chandler>  why did you look at me when you said that? 
<monica> well, i guess now we can't go. 
<rachel> what? come on, you do what you want to do. do we always have to do everything together? 
<monica> you know what? you're right.

<chandler> wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. i was awesome, ok? she was biting her lip to stop from screaming. 
<ross> wow! 
<chandler> now i know it's been awhile, but i took it as a good sign.  
<ross> still doing the screening thing? 
<chandler> i had sex today. i never have to answer that phone again. 
<s> here comes the beep, you know what to do. 
<s> hey, bob, it's jade. listen, i just wanted to tell you that i was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, i ended up meeting a guy.

<s> eh.  
<chandler> eh? 
<s> oh, bob, he was nothing compared to you. i had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name. 
<chandler> well, that makes me feel so good. 
<s> it was just so awkward and bumpy. 
<ross>  bumpy? 
<chandler> well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. and uh maybe you have to get used to it. 
<s> well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what i mean?  
< 
<monica> you know what? i'm not gonna be able to enjoy this. 
<ross> yeah, i know, it's my birthday. we all should be here. 
<chandler> so, let's go.  
<ross> well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song. 
<chandler> yeah, i mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now. 
<monica> you know, the guys are probably having a great time.

<phoebe>  hey joey. 
<joey> hey pheebs. 
<phoebe> how come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar? 
<joey> i can't find the remote.  thank you. 
<phoebe> so, scott asked me to come over for lunch today and i did. 
<joey> and? 
<phoebe> and we did. 
<joey> all right pheebs, way to go. 
<phoebe> yay me. 
<joey> so, so how did it happen? 
<phoebe> well, i finally took your advice and asked him what was going on. 
<joey> and what did he say? 
<phoebe> he said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that i was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. so he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious. 
<joey> wow. 
<phoebe> yeah, so i said, "okay, relax please," y'know, i mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. so after a looooot of talking. . . i convinced him. 
<joey> let me get this straight. he got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea. 
<phoebe> um-hum. 
<joey> this man is my god. 
< 
<rachel> hi. 
<ross> i didn't get a cat. 
<rachel> oh, that's um, interesting. 
<ross> no, no it's not interesting. okay, it's very, very not interesting. in fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting. 
<rachel> all right, i got it ross. 
<ross> you had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me. 
<rachel>  what? 
<ross> i was doing great with julie before i found out about you. 
<rachel> hey, i was doin' great before i found out about you. you think it's easy for me to see you with julie? 
<ross> then you should have said something before i met her. 
<rachel> i didn't know then. and how come you never said anything to me. 
<ross> there was never a good time. 
<rachel> right, you, you only had a year. we only hung out every night. 
<ross> not, not, not every night. you know, and... and it's not like i didn't try, rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? like, like italian guys or ex-fiancés or, or, or italian guys. 
<rachel> hey, there was one italian guy, okay, and do you even have a point? 
<ross> the point is i... i don't need this right now, okay. it, it's too late, i'm with somebody else, i'm happy. this ship has sailed. 
<rachel> yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me? 
<ross> hey, i've been doin' it since the ninth grade, i've gotten pretty damn good at it. 
<rachel> all right, fine, you go ahead and you do that, all right ross. 
<ross> fine.

<ross> yeah, it was, but...i get home, ok, and i see julie's saline solution on my night table. and i'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am i doing? i mean, here i am, i am with julie, this incredible, great woman, who i care about and who cares about me, and i'm like, what, am i just gonna throw all that away? 
<joey> you got all that from saline solution?

<s>  there was a girl, we'll call her betty, and a guy let's call him neil. now i can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. now our neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. will betty be the one who he loves truly? or will it be the one who we'll call ju...loolie? he must decide, he must decide, even though i made him up, he must decide!

<s> mockolate. 
<s> i'm sorry? 
<s> mockolate. it's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute. 
<s> ohh.  
<s> go ahead. try a piece. yeah, we think that mockolate is even better than chocolate. 
<s> all right. mmm-mmm.  
<s> yeah? 
<s>  i love how it crumbles. now see, your chocolate doesn't do that. 
<s> no, ma'am. well, anyhoo, we should be getting our f.d.a. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for thanksgiving. see, the way we look at it, chocolate already 
<s>  mmm-mmm. 
<s> but, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make thanksgiving the mockolate holiday. 
<s> wow. 
<s> aren't you going to swallow that? 
<s> just waiting for it to stop bubbling. 
<s> yeah, isn't that great? 
<s>  mmm. 
<s> well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some thanksgiving-themed recipes. you think you might be interested?

<joey> ross, listen. i got two words for you. threesome.  
<s> ok, all right, look. let's get logical about this, ok? we'll make a list. rachel and julie, pros and cons. oh. we'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and i can use different colors for each column. 
<ross> can't we just use a pen? 
<s> no, amish boy. 
<joey> ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. all right, rachel first. 
<ross> i don't know. i mean, all right, i guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes. 
<joey> you could say that. 
<ross> and i guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. and i've seen her be a little too into her looks. oh, and julie and i, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but rachel's just a waitress. 
<s> waitress. got it. you guys wanna play doom? or we could keep doing this. what else? 
<ross> i don't know.

<s>  alright.  "it was summer, and it was hot. rachel was there. a lonely gray couch. 'oh, look,' cried ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. the end." 
<ross> that's it? that's all you wrote? you're the worst writer in the whole world. 
<s> all right, you know what? this isn't funny anymore. there's something about me on that piece of paper and i want to see it. 
<ross> no, you don't. 
<s> all right, you know what, that's fine. if you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. i do not need to see it.  
<s> what is this? ross, what is this? 
<s> good luck.  
<ross> ok, just, just remember how crazy i am about you, ok? 
<s> kind of ditzy? too into her looks? spoiled? 
<ross> now that's a little spoiled. he was supposed to type "little", the idiot. 
<s> just a waitress? 
<ross> no, that, that was, i mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. is this over yet rach? 
<s> oh! i do not have chubby ankles!  
<ross> no, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. look at julie's column. 
<s> she is not rachem. what the hell's a rachem? is that some stupid paleontology word that i wouldn't know because i'm just a waitress.

<joey> hey, cut him some slack. it was chandler's idea. 
<s> what? 
<s> what? 
<s> oh good, i was hoping that would come up. 
<s> this was your idea? 
<s> what were you thinking? 
<s>  all right, let's get some perspective here, ok? these things, they happen for a reason. 
<s> yeah. you! 
<s> all right, pheebs, back me up here, ok? you believe in that karma crap, don't you?

<s> no. 
<ross> no? 
<s> that's what i said. 
<s> look, maybe we should go? 
<s> no, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking. 
<ross> rach, come on, look, i know how you must feel. 
<s>  no, you don't, ross. imagine the worst things you think about yourself. now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you. 
<ross> no, but, but i wanna be with you in spite of all those things. 
<s> oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, ross.  i said don't go! 
<ross> you know what? you know what? if, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you. 
<s> well, then, i guess that's the difference between us. see, i'd never make a list.  
<joey>  i never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know?  maybe a little longer. 
< 
<s> now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. i've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate. 
<s> doesn't matter. 
<s> what? 
<s> our fda approval didn't come through. something about laboratory rats. 
<s> oh, gosh, i'm sorry. 
<s> yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check.  thank you for all the trouble you went through. um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you? 
<s> well, uh, i ate some. 
<s> oh, some, that's fine. some is fine. some is not a lot. so, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it? 
<  
<s> hello?  
<ross> hi. 
<s>  is that him again? tell him i'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down. 
<s>  listen, i... i don't think this is the best time. 
<ross> look, can, can you do something for me? 
<s> sure, what? ok, ok.   music?  
<s> the next one's dedicated to rachel from ross. rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.   
<s> uh, we've just gotten a call from rachel, and she told us what ross did. it's pretty appalling, and ross, if you're listening, i don't wanna play your song anymore. why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? avery, michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out. 
< 
<s> hi, thanks for coming in again. 
<s> oh, not at all. i have no morals and i need the cash.

<rachel> phoebe, i thought your dad was in prison. 
<phoebe> no, that's my stepdad. my real dad's the one that ran out on us before i was born. 
<rachel> how have you never been on oprah? 
<phoebe>  ok, look, see, this is him. my mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy. 
<monica> honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie. 
<phoebe> it's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. ok, i have to talk to my grandmother.  
<monica> oh, wait a minute honey. 
<s> phoebs.  
<monica> wow. 
<joey> so anyway, i'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .

<phoebe> ok, is this really my father? 
<s> is it really your fa--i can't... well of course it is. 
<phoebe> ok, i smell smoke. maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire. 
<s> look, i. . . 
<phoebe> ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me. 
<s> alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame. 
<phoebe> oh god. 
<s> it was your mother's idea. ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, i didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. not impossible, but harder. 
<phoebe> alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? and then, i guess, ok, he doesn't live in a hut in burma where there's no phones? 
<s> last i heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate. 
<phoebe> ok, that makes no sense. why would the villagers worship a pharmacist? 
<s> honey. 
<phoebe>  oh. 
<s> anyway, that's all i know. that, and this.  this is the real him. 
<phoebe> oh. 
< 
<chandler> ya know i remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. he didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.

<rachel> oh, by the way mon, i don't think the mailman liked your cookies. here are the ornaments your mom sent.

<s> although, you know what? you might want to consider wearing underwear next time. yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your... royal subject. 
<joey> here it is, here it is.  the only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction was joseph tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king. 
<s> ok, look, that is one guy's opinion, alright. phoebs, read yours. 
<s> ok.  the only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction... 
<s> does anyone have one from a different paper? ross, read yours. 
<ross> i don't want to.

<ross> yeah. 
<joey> maybe they do. i've been doin' this ten years and i haven't gotten anywhere. there's gotta be a reason.

<joey> no, no, no, it.. it's too hard. it's not worth it. i quit. 
<s> wait, wait, wait, wait, wait one minute. wait a minute. i believe this will change your mind.  in a mediocre play, joseph tribbiana was able to achieve brilliant new levels of... continued on page 153... sucking. credits

<joey> monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?

<s> look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, i don't know... but, uh, i'm kind of worried about you. 
<s> ok, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, i don't know... i always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'i'm just a social drinker,' or, 'c'mon, it's flag day.'

<joey> i've never slept with someone for a part. 
<s> well is she...  
<joey> sorry. 
<s> it's alright. is she good-looking? 
<joey> yeah, she's totally good looking. i mean, if i met her in a bar, or something, i'd be buying her breakfast.  you know, after having slept with her. 
<s> y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. y'know, i mean, the way that i see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. y'know, i mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got christmas. 
<joey> i just... i just don't think that i want it that way though, y'know? i mean, let's say i do make it, alright? i'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the little general. 
<s> didn't you used to call it the little major? 
<joey> yeah, but after denise demarco, i had to promote it. 
< 
<s> can i get you something from the bar? 
<s> yes, i would like something.  no, no thank you. 
<s> if... if you want to drink, it's ok with me, i've got to get used to it.

<ross> ooooohhhh.  
<s> what's with all the bottles of liquor? 
<ross> what's going on, is... uh, bobby drinking again? 
<s> oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. that way he's still sober but i find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.  
<s> oh god, even his knock is boring.  
<s> hi. i'll be ready in just a second. 
<s> uh, can i talk to you a minute? 
<s> sure.  
<s> this is really hard for me to say.

<joey> hey. 
<s> hey! 
<ross> how'd the callback go? 
<joey> it was unbelievable! i walked in there and she was all over me. 
<s> so what'd you do? 
<joey> well, i couldn't do it. i told her i didn't want to get the part that way. 
<ross> good for you. 
<joey> but wait, wait, wait. then, after i left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part. 
<s> so... and? 
<joey> soooooo... you are now looking at dr. drake ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes! 
<s> allright! 
<joey> alright... i've got to go shower.   phoebe are sitting on the couch.]

<s> oh, hey. 
<s> hi. 
<s> i guess you guys heard, rachel dumped me.

<s> oh i do, it's.... it's bob saget. she hates him. 
<s> oh.  
<s> hey. 
<s> hey!

<ross> ok. here's his diaper bag, and his uh, mr. winky, and uh...oh, him. hi! 
<s> so how did everything go? 
<ross> oh, great. great. there was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it. 
<s> well, we've gotta go. 
<ross> ok. 
<s> oh, right. um, i've got some news. it's about us. 
<ross> oh, you and me? 
<s> uh, no, susan and me. 
<s> the other us. 
<ross> ok. 
<s> we're uh, we're getting married. 
<ross> as in, "i now pronounce you wife and wife" married? 
<s> anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to. 
<ross> why wouldn't i want to come? i had fun at the first wedding. 
<s> look i just thought that... 
<ross> no no no, i mean, hey, why shouldn't i be happy for you? what would it say about me if i couldn't revel in your joy? i'm revelling baby, believe me! 
<s> is your finger caught in that chair? 
<ross> mmm hmmm. 
<s> want us to go? 
<ross> uh-huh.  
<ross> this is so cool. you're actually gonna be on television. 
<joey> it really hit me last night. i'm gonna be on days of our lives. and then i started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives.. 
<monica> yes! carol and susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast. 
<monica> they want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as i've never catered before, and i really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it? 
<ross> would it matter? 
<monica> oh, you are so great!  thank you! 
<joey> are you really not going? 
<ross> i am really not going. i don't get it. they already live together, why do they need to get married? 
<monica> they love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them. 
<ross> if you wanna call that a reason. 
<chandler>  who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? hi, neighbor. 
<monica> ross, i thought you were over this. 
<ross> look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? she's my ex-wife. if she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there. 
<joey> hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever. 
<rachel>  did i miss it? did i miss it? 
<joey> no, i'm on right after this guy shoots himself. 
<chandler> whoa, she's pretty. 
<joey> yeah, and she's really nice too. she taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting. 
<rachel> i'm sorry, what? 
<monica> what? 
<joey> it's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. so while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. 
<chandler> oh, ok. 
<joey> there's my scene, there's my scene.  "mrs. wallace, i'm dr. drake ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. 
<joey> i'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. perhaps we can discuss this over coffee. 
<chandler> nice! 
<rachel> that's great! 
<ross> excellent! 
<chandler> for a minute there i thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.  
<ross> that is so good! do it again! 
<joey> all right, all right. "damnit braverman, it's right there on the chart!" 
<chandler> that's great. all right, i gotta get to work, i got a big dinosaur bone to inspect. 
<ross> no no, that's me. 
<chandler> oh, yeah. 
<ross> oh, hello. 
<phoebe> oh, thanks. i couldn't uh... 
<ross> is everything ok? 
<phoebe> um, no, huh-uh. one of my clients died on the massage table today. 
<ross> oh my god. 
<chandler> that's a little more relaxed than you want them to get. 
<phoebe> yeah, um, she was 82 years old. her name was um, mrs. adelman. 
<monica> oh, honey. 
<phoebe> yeah, it's just so strange. i mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, i'll have some breakfast, and then i'll take a little walk, and then i'll have my massage." little did she know god was thinking, "ok, but that's it." oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, i was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, i don't think it went very far. 
<rachel> what do you mean? 
<phoebe> i think it went into me.   
<monica> god, this is so hard. i can't decide between lamb or duck. 
<chandler> well, of course, lambs are scarier. otherwise the movie would've been called silence of the ducks. 
<rachel> ok, who ordered what? 
<ross> oh, i believe i had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim. 
<chandler> yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf? 
<rachel> oh god. 
<joey> i can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'. 
<rachel> i know, but it's just it's the first time, and i just don't want her to think that because i didn't marry barry, that my life is total crap, you know? 
<phoebe>  talk about crap. try listening to stella niedman tell the story of her and rod steiger for the hundredth time. 
<joey> uh, pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us? 
<phoebe> i don't know. i mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business.  sit up! 
<rachel> mom! is it a restaurant? who can tell? but i guess that's the fun. 
<rachel> pretty much. 
<rachel> this is joey, and phoebe, and this is chandler, and you remember ross. 
<ross> hi, mrs. green.  
<rachel> oh mom! 
<chandler> believe me, sometimes that happens. father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. i am just so proud of you. 
<rachel> really? 
<phoebe> i know who it is you remind me of. evelyn dermer. 'course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. now she looks like soupy sales. 
<joey> pheebs, who's evelyn dermer? 
<phoebe> i don't know. who's soupy sales? [at rachel and monica's 
<rachel> yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument. 
<rachel> i know. and mom, i realize you and daddy were upset when i didn't marry barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know? you and i think, oh, this is what i want. 
<rachel> for...me. 
<rachel> well, what do you mean? 
<monica>  all right. tell me if this is too cute. lesbian wedding, chicken breasts. 
<rachel> oh god. i think i'm gonna be sick. 
<monica> why? it's not like i'm putting little nipples on them. 
<ross> and you had no idea they weren't getting along? 
<rachel> none. 
<joey> they didn't fight a lot? 
<rachel> no! they didn't even talk to each other. god, how was i supposed to know they were having problems? 
<phoebe>  in my day, divorce was not an option. 
<joey> hey, look who's up. 
<rachel> i just can't believe this is happening. i mean, when i was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. i just figured as a grownup i wouldn't have to worry about this. 
<monica> is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? i mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you. 
<rachel> well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut? 
<chandler> you know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. but in your case it's actually kinda true. 
<phoebe> that's him. 
<chandler> damn. my mail order grandfather hasn't come yet. 
<phoebe> yes, hi, mr. adelman. thanks for meeting me. 
<phoebe> um, do you wanna sit? i do for you, my dear? 
<phoebe> i don't know how to say this, but i think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me. 
<phoebe> yeah. ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around? she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything. 
<phoebe> everything? 
<phoebe> whoa, that's a lot of stuff. 
<phoebe> i'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.  
<rachel> these are from halloween three years ago. 
<rachel> no, that was his costume. see, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist. 
<monica> um, you guys, you know when i said before, "thank you, but i don't really need your help"? 
<rachel> actually, what i think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen." 
<monica> really? weird. anyway, see, i planned everything really well. i planned and i planned and i planned. it just turns out, i don't think i planned enough time to actually do it. 
<rachel> hey, mon, you want some help? 
<monica> if you want. 
<phoebe>  hey. what a day. i took her everywhere. the museum of modern art, rockefeller center, statue of liberty. 
<rachel> she's still with you? 
<phoebe> yeah. i guess she hasn't seen everything yet. i'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again.  oh, such a pretty face. anybody have any marijuana? 
<rachel> god! 
<monica> all right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food. 
<rachel> oh! what's new in sex? 
<monica> i'm dicing, i'm dicing, i don't hear anything. might be more. 
<rachel> oh, i'm sorry. you know what? i cannot have this conversation with you. i mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell daddy. what? what do you want? do you want my blessing? 
<rachel> you want me to talk you out of it? 
<rachel> then what? what do you want? 
<rachel> why on earth would i understand this? 
<rachel> oh. 
<monica> all right people, we're in trouble here. we've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. move, move, move! 
<chandler> monica, i feel like you should have german subtitles. 
<monica> joey, speed it up! 
<joey> i'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets! 
<phoebe> monica, how did this happen? i thought you had this all planned out. 
<monica> do you want me to cry? is that what you want? do you wanna see me cry? 
<phoebe> sir! no sir! 
<monica>  all right, you! 
<ross> no. look, i told you i am not a part of this thing. 
<monica> all right, look, ross. i realize that you have issues with carol and susan, and i feel for you, i do. but if you don't help me cook, i'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and i'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in ross". all right, ball the melon. 
<chandler> hey! how come i'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.  
<monica> hi. 
<s> how's it going? 
<monica> it's goin' great. right on schedule. got my little happy helpers. 
<s> fine, whatever. 
<ross> what's the matter? 
<s> nothing. ok, everything. i think we're calling off the wedding. 
<ross> what? 
<monica> you're still gonna pay me, right? or something a little less selfish. 
<ross> carol, what's the matter? what happened? 
<s> my parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming. 
<ross> oh my god. 
<s> i mean, i knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. they're supposed to give me away and everything. 
<ross> it's ok. i'm sorry. 
<s> and then susan and i got in this big fight because i said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if i couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. i don't know what to do. 
<ross> i uh can't believe i'm gonna say this, but i think susan's right. 
<s> you do? 
<ross> look, do you love her? and you don't have to be too emphatic about this. 
<s> of course i do. 
<ross> well then that's it. and if george and adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. look, this is your wedding. do it. 
<s> you're right. of course you're right. 
<monica> so we're back on? 
<s> we're back on. 
<monica> you heard the woman. peel, chop, devil! i can't believe i lost 2 minutes.  
<joey> it just seems so futile, you know ? all these women, and nothing. i feel like superman without my powers, you know? i have the cape, and yet i cannot fly. 
<chandler> well now you understand how i feel every single day, ok? the world is my lesbian wedding.  
<phoebe>  butterscotch? no one? all right, you'll be sorry later.  
<s> thank you. 
<ross> any time.  
<s> ross.  
<s> you know, nothing makes god happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. friends, family, we're gathered here today to join carol and susan in holy matrimony. 
<phoebe>  oh my god. now i've seen everything!  whoa, she's gone. she's gone. she's gone! go ahead, get married. go, go.  
<monica> would you look at them? 
<ross> yeah, can't help but. 
<joey>  how's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you?  i wrapped those bad boys. 
<phoebe> i miss rose. 
<chandler> oh, yeah? 
<phoebe> i know it's kind of weird, but i mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now i just feel kind of alone. 
<s> you know, i uh, i couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and i think it's time for you to forget about rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink? 
<phoebe> ok, that's so nice.  
<chandler>  i shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?  
<rachel> hey, mom? having fun? girls made eyes at me over the buffet. oh, i'm not saying it's something i wanna pursue, but it's nice to know i have options. 
<rachel> there's more alcohol, right?  
<s> how you doin'? 
<ross> ok. 
<s> you did a good thing today. 
<ross> yeah.

<ross> well, mon, i was married. 
<phoebe> yeah, me, too, technically. 
<rachel> i had a wedding. 
<monica> all right, just trying to start an interesting discussion. 
<joey> i got one. which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?  
<chandler> isn't ben in this? 
<s> oh, yeah! the one after the superbowl the one after the superbowl originally written by michael borkow, mike sikowitz & jeffrey astrof transcribed by josh hodge minor additions and adjustments by dan silverstein.

<s> can't get the monkey off your back? then put it in your mouth... 
<s> ...with monkeyshine beer.  monkeyshine beer, 'cause it's a jungle out there.] 
<ross> that commercial always makes me so sad. 
<joey> yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out ok. 
<ross> i meant because the monkey in it reminds me of marcel. 
<phoebe> i can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin. 
<monica> and the fact that they're both monkeys. 
<ross> sometimes i wonder if i did the right thing, ya know, giving him away. 
<rachel> oh, ross, you had to, i mean, he was humping everything in sight. i mean, i have a malibu barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding. 
<ross> remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it. 
<chandler> yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. when i did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden i have this big attitude problem. 
< 
<joey> hey, hey, check it out, guess what i got. 
<chandler> rhythm? 
<joey> no, my first fan mail. 
<s> alright! 
<monica>  'dear dr. remore, know that i love you and would do anything to have you.' gosh. 'your not-so-secretive admirer, erica ford.' ooh wait, 'ps enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.' 
<rachel> ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married. 
<monica> this wasn't addressed to days of our lives, this is, this came to your apartment. there's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building. 
<joey> oh my god, i got my very own stalker.  
<ross> hey guys. 
<s> hey. 
<phoebe> ooh, where are you off to, travelin' jake? 
<ross> well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in l.a. so i figured i'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise marcel. 
<chandler> you know i think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.  
<rachel> oh, phoebe, that really cute guy is here again. 
<phoebe> oh, oh, ok, so everyone, pretend like i'm telling you a story, ok. and, and it's really funny. so everyone just laugh, now.

<chandler> the one time they're not home. 
<joey> ok, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.

<ross> i can't believe this. 
<s> i'm sorry mr._geller. but ya know, there's an old saying, 'sometimes monkeys die.' it's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today. 
<ross> well, ya know, someone should have called me. 
<s> i'm sorry. look, i know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture. 
<ross> zoo dollars? 
<s> yes, and come see the bird show at 4. the macaws wear hats. well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.

<rachel> oh my god. 
<monica> ah, and i mean, he's going out with her? he can not persue this. 
<chandler> hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. i mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? what're you lookin' at me for? he's the one who wants to boff the maniac. 
<s> you ok? 
<phoebe> no, uh-uh, i'm just, i'm nervous. so, you know what, maybe if i just, if i picture them all in their underwear. 
<s> that's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.

<monica> you know what, i think it's cute, you trying to be more like richard. 
<joey> not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.  
<ross> look it's the artist formerly known as chandler. 
<chandler> just tryin' somethin' here, ya know. 
<monica> so joey, why didn't you grow a moustache? 
<joey> oh we flipped for it. i got the cigar, he got the moustache. figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks. 
<ross> yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine. 
<chandler> hey listen, we've gotta go, i promised richard we'd meet him downstairs. 
<monica> you're meeting richard? 
<joey> yeah, we're goin' to a ranger game. 
<chandler> yeah, didn't he tell ya? 
<monica> well, he told me he was going out with the guys, i just didn't know that you were the guys. 
<chandler> you hear that? we're the guys. 
<joey> we're the guys. 
<monica> with that moustache doesn't chandler remind you of aunt sylvia? 
<ross> thank you. 
< 
<ross> hi, we're visitiing. it's ben and his da-da. da-da. can you say da-da? look, i'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try. 
<rachel> no luck huh? 
<ross> naa. a while ago i got a sah out of him, which i thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause i, i gotta take this off. 
<rachel> oh, yeah sure, ok.  
<ross> what're you doing? 
<rachel> uh, i'm holding ben. 
<ross> yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb. 
<rachel> ok. 
<ross> well just hold him like you'd hold a football. 
<rachel> this is how i would hold a football. 
<ross> ok, here, here. there we go. 
<rachel> ok, i'm sorry, i'm just not very good with babies. i mean i haven't been around them, i mean, you know, since i was one. 
<ross> it's alright, it's no big deal. 
<rachel> really? 
<ross> yeah, definitely, i'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby. 
<rachel> what? 
<ross> what? 
<rachel> you think about stuff like that? 
<ross> uhh, yeah. i mean, actually i kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies. 
<rachel> two, two babies? 
<ross> yeah. ya know, a boy and a girl. hopefully the girl will come first so ben here won't feel too competitive. 
<rachel> then what's gonna happen? 
<ross> well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, scarsdale. 
<rachel> uh-huh. 
<ross> yeah, that way i figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. and yes, i know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, nassau county but the school system's supposedly great. 
<rachel> wow. wow, that's great. great. ok, wow, you know what. 
<ross> huh? 
<rachel> i'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this  and um, i am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. ok. oh look at that, i don't have a pot. i don't have a pot. well, hey, maybe i've got one at home, or in scarsdale. hey is that a door?  
< 
<phoebe> hey. 
<s> hey phoebs, what's happening? 
<phoebe> oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the andes. 
<monica> so you watched the movies huh? 
<phoebe> uh huh, what is happening to the world? i mean, no no no, 'cause et leaves, and and rocky loses, charlotte dies. 
<s> charlotte who? 
<phoebe> with the web, the spider she dies, she does. she has babies and dies. it's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud. 
<monica> alright, you wanna feel better? 
<phoebe> yeah. 
<monica> ok, here, watch this. 
<phoebe> it's a wonderful life. yes i've heard of this. 
<monica> so you can't lose, it's there in the title. wonderfullness is baked right in. 
<phoebe> please, i almost fell for that with, uh, pride of the yankees, i thought i was gonna see a film about yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets lou gehrig's disease. 
<s> uh, the guy was lou gehrig. didn't you kinda see it coming? 
<phoebe> phoebe, just watch that, i promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity. 
<chandler>  hey, big guy, game time. 
<s> hey, be right there. 
<monica> there's a game? 
<chandler> uh, yeah, i just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. bring your nerves of steel. 
<s> it's the basketball playoffs. 
<monica> listen, um honey, i appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, i mean, they have each other. 
<s> oh, no, honey, i mean, don't worry, i like hanging out with those guys. it's fun for me. they're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'you know who just died shoveling snow?' 
<monica> alright that's great, then just go. go knicks. 
<s> uh, it's the college playoffs. 
<monica> oh, then go vassar. 
<s> uh, they're not in it. 
<monica> ok, then just go. 
<s> ok.  
<monica> oh, why does this bother me so much? i mean i don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them. 
<phoebe> sure. 
<monica> it's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and i don't know, what do i do? 
<phoebe> does it matter? you're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off. 
<rachel>  aghh. 
<phoebe> me too.  
<monica> i've got a question. richard made plans again with the guys. 
<rachel> yeah well, ross just made plans for the whole century. 
<monica> ya know what, i think i'm gonna go to my room and read cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. know what, at least maybe i can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover cristmas candles. 
<ross>  ok, what the hell happened back there? 
<rachel> i don't know, you tell me. one minute i'm holding ben like a football, the next thing i know, i've got two kids, i'm living in scarsdale complaining about the taxes. 
<ross> well i'm sorry, i think about stuff. ya know, i mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders. 
<rachel> ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks. 
<ross> c'mon, what, you never think about our future? 
<rachel> yes, but i, i think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next saturday night. i do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. you know what our childrens names are gonna be. 
<ross> no, no, i mean, ya know, i, i read a book and there was a girl named emily and i thought, i thought that might be good. 
<rachel> what was the book? 
<ross> the big book of childrens' names. 
<rachel> ok, ross, ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing. 
<ross> yeah. 
<rachel> but i do not want to have everything decided for me. i spent my whole life like that. it's what i had with barry, that was one of the reasons i left. i, i like not knowing right now and i'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that. 
<ross> ok fine. 
<rachel> thank you. 
<ross> we're not done. 
<rachel> i didn't know that. 
<ross> ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that. 
<rachel> fine, i will. 
<ross> good, 'cause i love you. 
<rachel> oh yeah. 
<ross> yeah. 
<rachel> well i love you too. 
<ross> well that's the first time we've said that. 
<rachel> yes it is.

<phoebe> hey. oh thanks for the great movie tip. 
<monica> did you like it? 
<phoebe> oh yeah. you know, i don't know if i was happier when um george bailey destroyed the family business or um, donna reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed. 
<monica> alright, i'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful? 
<phoebe> i didn't watch the ending, i was too depressed. it just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, "it's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does." 
< 
<chandler> kick save and... denied. 
<s> but... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... bam! yes! could that shot be any prettier? 
<joey> man you are incredible.

<s> well.

<monica> so, i'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's rachel's birthday, i mean, we want it to be special, i thought i'd poach a salmon. 
<s> ohhh. 
<monica> what? 
<ross> question. why do we always have to have parties where you poach things? 
<monica> you wanna be in charge of the food committee? 
<ross> question two. why do we always have to have parties with committees? 
<joey> really. why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun? 
<ross> yeah. 
<phoebe> yeah, i agree. ya know, i think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and i'm just not sure we are. 
<monica> alright. if you guys don't want it to be special, fine. you can throw any kind of party you want.  
<monica> joey they're not real. i start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. see  honk honk. 
<chandler> wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns. opening titles 
< 
<ross> i talked to rachel's sisters, neither of them can come. 
<monica> ok, um so, i still have to invite dillon and emma and shannon cooper. 
<joey> woah, woah, woah, uh, no shannon cooper. 
<phoebe> why not her? 
<joey> cause she uh, she steals stuff. 
<chandler> or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and joey just slept with her and never called her back. 
<monica> joey that is horriable. 
<joey> hey i liked her, alright. maybe, maybe too much. i don't know i guess i just got scared. 
<phoebe> i'm sorry, i didn't know. 
<joey> i didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.  
<ross> hi honey, how did it go? 
<rachel> agh, it was the graduation from hell. 
<chandler> ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship. 
<rachel> ya know, i mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. my sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. it's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a celica. 
<monica> so what happened? 
<rachel> my parents happened. all they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. but nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. bishop tutu actually had to stop and shush them. but you know what, you know what the good news is? i get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours. 
<phoebe> ok, so i guess we don't invite her parents. 
<monica> well, how bout just her mom? 
<chandler> why her mom? 
<monica> cause i already invited her. 
<phoebe> ooh, ooh, did you ask stacy roth? 
<joey> oh no, can't invite her. she also steals.

<s> ohhh, you're having a parteee. 
<monica> no, no, not a party. just a surprise gathering of some people rachel knows. um, this is phoebe and chandler and joey. 
<s> i'll never remember all of that. so uh, what's the deal? rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it? 
<chandler> this isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?

<chandler> so, basically just a chinese guy. 
<joey> uh, hey, dr._greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on rachel's bed.

<s> well, my goodness, what was that? 
<monica> sandra, i am so sorry, i thought you were rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet. 
<s> you thought i was rachel? 
<chandler> yes because uh, you look so young.

<joey>  ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-,  oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.

<rachel> you want me to see a therapist? 
<s> sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. you've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father. 
<rachel> ok mom, you know what, fine, i'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, i gotta go, i gotta go do a thing.

<rachel> this is it, isn't it? i mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. my mom there, my dad there. thanksgiving, christmas. she gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. oh, chandler how did you get through this? 
<chandler> well, i relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed. 
<rachel> ya know, i just, so weird. i mean i was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all i kept thinking about was the fourth of july. 
<chandler> becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other? 
<rachel> it's just this thing. every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. my sister jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. but then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. it never occured to anybody to bring another one. and now it's just... 
<chandler> i, i know.  
< 
<monica> ok, thanks for coming, i hope you guys had fun. 
<s> alright, monica dear, i'm gonna hit the road. now i've left my 10 verbs on the table. and you be sure and send me that finished poem.

<s>alright, alright, i can get my own coat.  
<chandler> sorry, we're on a major flan high. 
<phoebe> oh no, you're not supposed to be here. this is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out.  or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe. 
<s> i have to be heading to my chateau, thank you. 
<phoebe> oh all right, then i guess we're going back into the hallway. 
<joey> thanks for coming mrs._greene.  well, ok, you take care.

<phoebe> yeah, i met him when i was playing guitar in washington square park. ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change. 
<joey> hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man? 
<phoebe> no. no, he is my submaring guy. he resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. only this time he's coming for two weeks. two whole weeks, which means yay.

<s> monica...  hey mon, i have a question. is leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?

<monica> just waiting for you sweetie. 
<s> are you remaking the bed? 
<monica> i'm sorry, i'm sorry. you know what, the way you did it was just fine.

<monica> if i tell you, you'll think i'm crazy. 
<s> you're pretty much running that risk either way. 
<monica> ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner. 
<s> oh, well that's not so crazy. 
<monica> i'm just easing you in. 
<s> oh, alright. 
<monica> alright, you see these little flower blossoms? they should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. you don't love me any more do you.

<monica> really? wow, well then come on, i wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point. 
< 
<chandler> hey, look joey, i'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, i can get you a job right here as an entry level processor. 
<joey> but don't you need experience for a job like that? 
<chandler> it's not that hard to learn. and as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. act like a processor, people will think you're a processor. 
<s>  hey chandler, here's this morning's projections.

<s> if i had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when i was 7, when jimmy hauser had the chicken pox. i would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.

<s> can i please see your face? 
<phoebe> nope. you don't want to see a face covered with pox.

<joey> aw, man i'm sorry . this must be very tough for ya, huh .

<ross> most of you don't know me, i'm rachel's boyfriend. 
<rachel> oh dear god. 
<ross> ross, uh and uh, i'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for rachel to come here tonight. and, uh, for the record she did not run out on barry because she had syphilis.  what are you doing i'm serious. uh, the reason she walked out on, on barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me  cheers. 
<rachel>  she you in the parking lot. 
<ross>  no, rach! 
<s> and once again she is out of here. okay who had? um?

<monica> i'll bet he's totally over me, i'll bet he's fine. 
<phoebe> all right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, i'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. okay. just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. and the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....

<rachel> no, i think i'm gonna catch up on my correspondence. 
<ross> how, how, um how can you not be going?

<ross> um, you know, just out of curiosity... 
<rachel> well, ever since i was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, i'm just, i don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood. 
<ross> right. right, okay, okay. i'm sorry. i'm sorry i yelled.

<s> well thanks.  
<phoebe> wait,  you know what, i got a little story. when i was in junior high school i went through this period where i thought i was a witch. and there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that i think will help you a lot. he said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' see what i'm saying?

<rachel> honey, come on, i have to be at work in like ten minutes  oh, all right, well it's not like i'm employee of the year or anything.   
<ross> there it is. 
<rachel> oh, oh, that's what you're talking about.  hey. 
<ross> hey. 
<chandler> do i look fat? 
<chandler> okay, i accept that. when janice asked me and i said no, she took that to mean that i was calling her a cow. 
<rachel> okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it. 
<chandler> okay, well. janice said 'hi, do i look fat today?' and i, i looked at her.... 
<ross> whoa, whoa, whoa. you looked at her. you never look. you just answer, it's just a reflex. do i look fat? nooo! is she prettier than i am? noo! does size matter? 
<rachel> nooo! 
<ross> and it works both ways. 
<chandler> okay, so you both just know this stuff? 
<rachel> well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on. 
<ross> okay, for instance. let's say, janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. which do you do? 
<chandler> that's easy, baggage claim. 
<ross>  wrong! now you're single. it's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. that way she knows you love her. 
<chandler> okay, this is good, this is good. all right listen, i have one. janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know i'm all for. but, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. so, uh, how do i tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something. 
<rachel> oh honey, i'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers.  okay, i'm late for work. 
<ross> oh. 
<rachel> all right are you guys gonna come down? 
<ross> uh, yeah, yeah i'll, i'm right behind you. 
<rachel> good luck chandler. 
<chandler> thank you rachel. 
<ross> bye sweetie. 
<rachel> bye hon. 
<ross>  okay the sleeping thing. very tricky business, but there is something you can do. 
<chandler> well, i thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers. 
<ross> noo! no, not cuddlily, not me, just her. i'm like you, i need the room. okay, come here.  okay, you're in bed... 
<chandler> yeah.  
<ross> i'm gonna use the cushion. 
<chandler> yeah. 
<ross> okay, you're in bed. she's over on your side, cuddling. now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her  and roll her back over to her side of the bed. and then you rollll a-way. hug for her! roll for you. 
<chandler> okay, the old hug and roll. 
<ross> yep. 
<chandler> okay, one question. 
<ross> shoot. 
<chandler> you're pretending the pillow's a girl right? 
< 
<joey> remember when you where a kid and your mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon? 
<rachel>  you're so pretty. 
<phoebe>  hi! 
<s> hey, phoebe. 
<phoebe> hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? i talked to him today. 
<joey>  you talked to him. are you crazy? 
<phoebe> okay, first i'm not crazy. and second, say it don't spray it. anyway his name is malcom, and he wasn't following me, i mean he was, but 'cause he thought i was ursula, ick. and, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'cause of the restraining order. 
<chandler> umm, not feeling better 'bout malcom. 
<phoebe> ooh! no, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. he's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. and we just get along really well, and he's so cute. 
<ross> oh my god, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker. 
<phoebe> no, i'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-ursula-ized', like you know, like i did for joey after he went out with her. 
<joey>  hey, i didn't stalk her. i mean  
<phoebe> okay, i asked for the news, not the weather.

<ross> what are you talking about? 
<monica> i'm talking about me having a baby. 
<ross> what? 
<rachel> are you serious? 
<monica> yeah. the great thing about the jam plan was, i was taking control of my life. so i asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when i came up with the baby plan. 
<ross> well, aren't you forgetin' something? what, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? dad! 
<monica> it took me 28 years to find one man that i wanna spend my life with, if i have to wait another 28 years then, i'll be 56 before i can have a baby, and that's just stupid. 
<chandler> that, that's what's stupid. 
<monica> i don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. and there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.

<s> keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do.  go ahead.  this works with any milk carton. 
<joey>  wow, it is easy.  now, i can have milk everyday.  opening credits 
< 
<chandler> well, it's official there are no good movies. 
<s> well, let's go to a bad one and make out.  
<monica> perhaps, you would like me to turn like this,  so that you can bunny bump against my back. 
<joey>  hey! 
<phoebe> hey. 
<chandler> hey, man. what's up? 
<joey> maybe you can tell me. my agent would like to know why i didn't show up at the audition i didn't know i had today. the first good thing she gets me in weeks. how could you not give me the message?! 
<chandler> well, i'll tell ya i do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me. 
<phoebe> yes, it was! it was him! uh huh!  okay, it was me! 
<joey> how is it you? 
<phoebe> well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. i mean, chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and i hadn't found a place to hide yet. i-i-i meant to tell you, and i wrote it all down on my hand. see, all of it.  
<joey> yep, that's my audition. 
<monica> see, now this is why i keep notepads everywhere. 
<phoebe> yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play. 
<s> what is the great tragedy here? you go get yourself another appointment. 
<joey> well, estelle tried, you know. the casting director told her that i missed my chance. 
<phoebe> that is unfair. i'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault. 
<joey> pheebs, you can't do that. the casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents. 
<phoebe> what a sad little life she must lead. okay, ooh . 
<joey> what, what are you doing? what are you doing? 
<phoebe> no, no, no, i know, i know, ooh.  'hi, this is katelynn, from phoebe buffay's office. um, is um, ann there for phoebe, she'll know what it's about.' 
<joey> hang up, hang up.  
<phoebe>  'annie! hi. listen we got a problem with joey tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. who did you speak to in my office? estelle, no, i don't know what i'm going to do with her. no. all right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.' 
<chandler> is anybody else scared? 
<phoebe>  'right, well look, um, if joey loses this audition, that is it for estelle. i don't care! annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?'  i need a pen.  
<chandler> get the woman a pad! get the woman a pad! a pad! a pad! 
<monica> oh, now you want a pad. 
< 
<ross> there's my boy! here's my boy! and here's his barbi  what's ah, what's my boy doing with a barbi? 
<s> he picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it. 
<s> he carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret. 
<ross> yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. why, why, why does he have it, again? 
<s> so he's got a doll? so what? unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business. 
<s> this doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it? 
<ross> you know what it's fine. if you're okay with the barbi thing, so am i.  
<ross> give daddy the barbi! ben, give, give me the barbi. okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck?  no. okay, oh, oh, how about a dino-soilder?  
<rachel> ross, you are so pathetic. why can't your son just play with his doll?  
<monica>  i gotta go to work. has anybody seen my left boob? 
<joey> i love that movie.  
<monica> there it is. joey, what are you doing? 
<joey> i'm sorry, it just felt nice. 
<chandler>  joe. joe! answer the phone. 
<joey> hey, i only got one good arm, you know. you should be doing stuff for me. go get me a sweater. 
<chandler> just do it! okay, it's janice and if i get it i'm going to have to see her tonight.  oh, that's great i'm gonna have to see her tonight. 
<rachel> what's the big deal? why don't you wanna see janice? 
<chandler> okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes. 
<ross> and that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata? 
<chandler> noo. 
<ross> you didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you. 
<chandler> no, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. and this alarm 
<rachel> men are unbelievable. 
<monica> what is it with you people! i mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away? 
<chandler> i know, that,  that's why i don't want to go tonight, i'm afraid i'm going to say something stupid. 
<monica> oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you. 
<joey> hey, you know about that?! 
<chandler> look what do i do? i wanna get past this, i don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. i wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!  
<ross>  where there is no fear of commitment. 
<chandler> do we have any... do we have any thoughts here? 
<joey> well, i've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as i understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. but, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. it have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! if you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. right. in this case, you have a fear of commitment, so i say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was. 
<rachel> amazingly, that makes sense. 
<chandler> you think? 
<joey> oh, yeah. go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind! 
<chandler> yeah, joe, i assure you if i'm staring down the barrel of a gun, i'm pretty much peeing every which way. 
< 
<phoebe> oh, it's your audition from this morning. can i use the phone again? 
<rachel> sure pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents. 
<joey> come on baby, come on! 
<phoebe>  'hi, i have phoebe buffay returning a page. okay, well, um, she's in her car i'll have to patch you through.' 
<rachel> very nice touch. 
<phoebe>  'okay, go ahead.'  um, hi annie.  fantastic!  you got it.  oh, okay, um, 'will he work for scale?' you ask me. well, i don't know about that,  except that i do and he will. great, oh you are such a sweetheart. i would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next.... op, went through a tunnel. 
<rachel> unbelievable. 
<joey> thank you so much. 
<phoebe> it was really fun, i mean i've never talked on a car phone before. 
<joey> you were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that i really, really want, and estelle couldn't get me in. 
<phoebe> oh, i don't know. i mean it was fun one time. 
<joey> come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two. 
<phoebe> two? 
<joey> yeah! well, well really it's three. please. you're so good at it. i love you. 
<phoebe> okay, i'll do it, but just these three, right 
<joey> nooo, four. 
< 
<s> so, how come you wanted to eat in tonight? 
<chandler> 'cause, i wanted to uh, give you this.  
<s> ohhh, are you a puppy!  contact paper! i never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper. 
<chandler> well, wait there's, there's more. see the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer.  see, the drawer actually goes in my dresser. 
<s> oh, you didn't have to do this. 
<chandler> yes, i did. yes, i did. because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get. 
<s> well, i gotta buy a vowel. because, oh my gawd! who, would've thought that someday, chandler bing would buy me a drawer. 
<chandler> well, not me. but that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. we should take a trip. 
<s> we should? 
<chandler> yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. and, i wanna meet your parents. we should take a trip with your parents! 
<s>  i don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! are you okay? 
<chandler> i am, i actually am. i mean this is amazing. my entire life i have feared this place, and now that i'm here it's like what was the big deal. i could probably say 'let's move in together.' and i'd be okay. 
<s> you probably want us to move in together? 
<chandler> it doesn't scare me! 
<s> yeah, well, it scares me! i mean i not even divorced yet, chandler. you know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. and, and i wasn't even that hungry. you know what, it's getting a little late, and i-i should just, um... 
<chandler> oh, no, no, no, don't go! i've scared ya'! i've said too much! i'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!!  hey, janice! it's me. um, yeah, i-i-i just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.  commercial break 
< 
<rachel> honey, this will help.  
<chandler> so, i finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down. 
<monica> that is never good. 
<chandler> then i got all needy and clingy. 
<rachel> okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. maybe it's not so bad. how did you leave it? 
<chandler> she said she'd call me. 
<chandler> oh god. 
<monica> welcome to our side of the tunnel. 
<chandler> this ice cream tastes like crap by the way. 
<rachel> yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. we sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases. 
<monica> you know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat. 
<rachel> yeah, you do. 
<chandler> so, you don't think i'm terminal? 
<monica> well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control. 
<chandler> okay, okay. so, should i call her? 
<rachel> this is a very critical time right now. if you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. you want her back you have to start acting aloof. 
<monica> she has to know that your not ready. 
<rachel> right. so, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. and then act aloof. 
<chandler> so i'm not, not gonna lose her? 
<rachel> oooh, honey, you're not a total loser. 
<chandler> i said, 'so i'm not gonna lose her?' 
<rachel> oh. 
< 
<ross> guess who's here. it's the toughest guy in toy land, ben.  'a real american hero. i'm g.i. joe!' drop the barbi, drop the barbi. 
<rachel> g.i. joe? do you really think he's gonna fall for that? 
<joey>  g. i. joe! cool! can i play? 
<ross> look ben, it's a toy that protects u.s. oil interests overseas! 
<phoebe>  helloo! oh!  
<joey> pheebs! there you are! 
<phoebe> no it's not, sorry. 
<joey> but phoebe, wait! wait! phoebe. phoebe!  
<phoebe> oh, joey! oh, okay, see i didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants. 
<joey> look listen, that tv movie i went in for? did you hear anything? i think i got a shot at it. 
<phoebe> yes! they called and you didn't get it! okay, i mean you didn't get it, i'm sorry, i'm sorry. 
<joey> it's okay, these things happen. 
<phoebe> but they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. oh god, i don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that. 
<joey> i'm, i'm okay. see.  
<phoebe> oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. you know what, i, i'm sorry i quit, okay, i just quit. 
<joey> no! no, no you can't quit! you're the best agent i ever had! look pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally. 
<phoebe> not personal, really, well they said that they never met an italian actor with a worse italian accent. 
<joey> they actually said that? 
<phoebe> yeah. ooh god, there's that face again! see i can't do this job! i... 
<joey> no, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. you know, estelle just says stuff like 'they went another way', but this, i can use this.  i canna work on a new accent. 
<phoebe> yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. yeah. 
<ross>  you'll never get me, joe!!!  
< 
<s>  no, thank you.  chandler! 
<chandler>  hello, janice. 
<s> what are you doing here? 
<chandler>  oh, just a bit of shopping. how've you been? 
<s> are you being british?! 
<chandler>  no. not anymore. 
<s> why are you shopping here? you don't live in this neighborhood. were you here waiting for me? 
<chandler> yeah, huh. i'm just uh, you know i'm just picking up some things for a party.  
<s> barley? what kind of party serves barley? 
<chandler> well, i'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours. 
<s> where is this party? 
<chandler> here in chelsea. 
<s> who's party is it? 
<chandler> a woman's 
<s> what woman?! 
<chandler>  chelsea. 
<s> okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that i could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. so like which of these two guys do you want to be?  
<chandler> can i be that guy? 
< 
<phoebe> okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on. 
<joey> okay, shoot. 
<phoebe> okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial. 
<joey> i didn't get it? 
<phoebe> no. they said you 'weren't believable as a human being.' so, you can work on that. 
<joey> okay, what else? 
<phoebe> um, the off-broadway play people said 'you were pretty but dumb.' 
<joey> oh. 
<phoebe> oh no wait, i'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.' 
<joey> look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, i really appreciate this pheebs, but i think i'm gonna have to go back to estelle. 
<phoebe> oh. 
<joey> yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her i don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out. 
<phoebe> yeah, no, i understand. 
<joey> you do, thanks. 
<phoebe> yeah. sorry.  
<joey> wait a minute. 
<phoebe> what? 
<joey> wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent. 
<phoebe>  oh, you caught me. i am so busted. 
<joey>  that's-ah what i suspected-ah. 
< 
<chandler> ....and then i just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store. 
<monica> my god! chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'. 
<chandler> i've actually ruined this haven't i? it's time for the good ice cream now, right? 
<rachel> yeah, it is. 
<monica> you know what, everything's gonna be okay.  
<chandler>  hello. hi, janice! can you hold on for a second? okay.  okay, what do i do? 
<rachel> shhh...i don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented. 
<monica> if-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call. 
<rachel> yeah. 
<chandler> hello! 
<monica> oh wait, you know what, i got it, i got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. be sleepy.

<rachel> he's soo lucky, if janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now. 
<chandler>  i love you too. 
<monica> aw, it's soo unfair.  
< 
<s> g. i. joe. g. i. joe?! 
<ross> hey, i don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose. 
<s> what'd you do, dip it in sugar? 
<ross> look, g. i. joe's in, barbi's out. and if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.' 
<monica> what are you being such a weenie for? so he has a barbi, big deal. you used to dress up like a woman. 
<ross> what? 
<monica> well, you used to dress up in mom's clothes all the time.

< 
<joey> good evening. im mr.tribbiani. and i will be teaching acting for soap operas. now um, on my first day as  dr. drake remoray on days of our lives,  i learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you dont have a line, but someone else just did. and it goes like this.  thanks, thanks, a lot. oh, by the way, before i forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. all right, moving right along. 
< 
<joey> hi! 
<phoebe> hey! ooh! how was teaching last night?

<ross> well mr. big shot is better than wethead. 
< 
<joey> okay, some tricks of the trade. now, ive never been able to cry as an actor, so if im in a scene where i have to cry, i cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. or ah, or, lets say i wanna convey that ive just done something evil. that would be the basic i have a fishhook in my eyebrow and i like it  okay, lets say ive just gotten bad news, well all i do there is try and divide 232 by 13.  and thats how its done. great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.

<ross> look, honey, i have tried to make nice, it doesnt work. 
<rachel> okay, look, ross, i realise that my father is difficult, but thats why you have got to be the bigger man here. 
<ross> look sweetie, i could be the bigger man, i could be the biggest man, i could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldnt make any difference, except that i could pick your father up and say like me! like me tiny doctor! 
<rachel> okay, well cant you just try it one more time ross? for me? for me? 
<ross> rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. you gotta face it, okay were never gonna get along.

<joey>  there will come a time in each of your careers when youll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. i had such an opportunity in the recent, present. and im ashamed to say that i took it, i advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. and now, hes got a two year contract opposite susan luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me im stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on tv. im sorry, im sorry, im sorry.  thank you.

<chandler> see that is the problem with invisible dentists. 
<ross> why? why cant you go to him? 
<phoebe> because, every time i go to the dentist, somebody dies. 
<chandler> that is so weird, because every time i go to the dentist, i look down the hygienists blouse. 
<rachel> phoebe, what? umm...what?! 
<phoebe> yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt mary, and then there was umm, john, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend albino bob.

<ross> it was soo not an accident. she saw i was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. and just keep running. 
<monica> to score the winning touchdown, by the way. 
<ross> whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didnt count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.

<rachel> um, there was a geller cup? 
<ross> yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. but our dad said, nobody won that game,  and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and....  threw it in the lake. 
<chandler> and was the curse lifted?

<rachel> yeah. 
<s> do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress? 
<rachel> oh, sure! do you need me to train somebody new?

<chandler>  yeah? opening credits

<s> so thats two boxes of the holiday macaroons. on behalf of the brown birds of america, i salute you.  
<ross> just admit it chandler, you have no backhand. 
<chandler> excuse me little one, i have a very solid backhand. 
<ross> shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand. 
<chandler> i was shrieking... like a marine.  
<ross> all right here. watch me execute the three ps of championship play. power.  precision.  and penache.  
< 
<monica> you broke a little girls leg?!! 
<ross> i know. i feel horrible. okay. 
<chandler>  says here that a muppet got whacked on seasame street last night.  where exactly were around ten-ish? 
<ross> well, im gonna go see her. i want to bring her something, what do you think shell like? 
<monica> maybe a hello kitty doll, the ability to walk...  
<rachel> im gonna get back to retraining.  
<ross> all right, see you guys.  
<chandler> look out kids, hes coming!  
<joey> and i gotta go sell some christmas trees. 
<phoebe> have fun. oh wait, no, dont! i forgot i am totally against that now. 
<joey> what? me having a job? 
<phoebe> no, no, i am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights.  hey, how do you sleep at night? 
<joey> well, im pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. hey, phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. those trees were born to be christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy. 
<phoebe> really?  
<chandler> yes. yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, its the only chance to see new york.  
<s> ...and after youve delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray.... 
<rachel> gunther, gunther, please, ive worked here for two and a half years, i know the empty trays go over there.  
<s> what if you put them here.  
<rachel> huh. well, y'know thats actually a really good idea, because that way theyll be closer to the mugs. y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too. 
<s> they already do. thats why they call it the tray spot. 
<rachel> gee, i always heard them talk about that, i just always thought that it was a club they went to. oh god, im, im sorry.  
<s> its all right. sweetheart. 
< 
<ross> so, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? i mean, your dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, dont have to sell those cookies anymore. 
<s> well, i kinda wanted to sell the cookies. the girl who sells the most wins a trip to spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle. 
<ross> wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh? 
<s> yeah. my dad says if i spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as i do daydreaming about outer space, hed be able to afford a trip to the taj mahal. 
<ross> i think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to india. 
<s> no. the one in atlantic city, dad loves the slots. he says hes gonna double the college money my grandma left me. 
<ross> huh. well, good luck to dad. say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win? 
<s> the girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five. 
<ross> yeah. 
<s> so far, ive sold seventy-five. 
<ross> four hundred, huh? well, that sounds do-able.  how much are the boxes? 
<s> five dollars a box. 
<ross>  and what is second prize? 
<s> a ten speed bike. but, id rather have something my dad couldnt sell. 
<ross> well, that makes sense. 
<s> could you do me one favor, if its not too much trouble? 
<ross> yeah, sarah, anything. 
<s> could you pull open the curtains for me? the astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we dont have a tv, the lady across the alley said shed push hers up to a window, so i could watch it. 
< 
<s>  yesss? 
<ross> hi, im selling brown bird cookies. 
<s> youre no brown bird, i can see you through my peephole. 
<ross> no, hi, im, im an honorary brown bird

<ross> ah, well, it means that i can sell cookies, but im not invited to sleep-overs. 
<s> i can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. now, go away! 
<ross> no, please, please, um, its for a poor little girl who wants to go to spacecamp more than anything in the world.

<joey> sure. 
<phoebe> yes. 
<joey> all right.

<joey> well we have to make room for the fresh ones. 
<phoebe> so, what happens to the old guys? 
<joey> well, they go into the chipper.

<ross> mon? 
<monica> all right, ill take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and thats it. i-i started gaining weight after i joined the brown birds.  remember, how dad bought all my boxes and i ate them all? 
<ross> ah, no mon, dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. but ah, y'know im sure thats not gonna happen this time, why dont i put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the rudolphs.

<rachel> well, yeah! im still pursuing that. 
<chandler> how... exactly are you pursuing that? y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago? 
<rachel> well, im also sending out.... good thoughts. 
<joey> if you ask me, as long as you got this job, youve got nothing pushing you to get another one. you need the fear. 
<rachel> the fear? 
<chandler> hes right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want. 
<rachel> well then how come youre still at a job that you hate, i mean why dont you quit and get the fear?  
<chandler> because, im too afraid. 
<rachel> i dont know, i mean i would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... oh, i just dont want to be 30 and still work here. 
<chandler> yeah, thatd be much worse than being 28, and still working here. 
<s> rachel? 
<rachel> yeah. 
<s> remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular. 
<rachel> cant i just look at the handles on them? 
<s> you would think. 
<rachel> okay, fine. gunther, y'know what, i am a terrible waitress, do you know why im a terrible waitress? because, i dont care. i dont care. i dont care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, i dont care where the tray spot is, i just dont care, this is not what i want to do. so i dont think i should do it anymore. im gonna give you my weeks notice.

<joey> well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know youll probably be hungry after the sex.

<rachel> how often do you read it? 
<joey> havent you ever read the same book over and over again? 
<rachel> well, umm, i guess i read little women more than once. but i mean thats a classic, whats so great about the shining? 
<joey> the question should be rach, what is not so great about the book ever. i bet its way better than that classic of yours. 
<rachel> okay. ah, well well just see about that, okay. i will read the shining,  and you will read little women.

<joey> oooh. 
<monica> yeah, ginger something. 
<joey> nooo. no, no, ah, are you sure it wasnt something that sounded like ginger, like ah, gingeer? 
<monica> no, it was ginger. i remember, because when he told me, i said,  the movie star. 
<joey> aww, man. thats the girl i was hiding from. when she finds out hes my roommate, shes gonna tell him what i did. 
<monica> well, what did you do? 
<joey> what, oh, oh, oh, no, no, i cant, i cant tell you that, its like the most awful, horrible thing ive ever done my whole life. 
<monica> y'know what, dont tell us. well just wait until chandler gets home,  because itll be more fun that way. 
<joey> all right!! okay, it was like four years ago. okay, ginger and i had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her dads cabin. just me, her, and her annoying little dog pepper. well that night, i cooked this really romantic dinner.... 
<monica> you gave her food poisoning!? 
<joey> i wish. no. after dinner, me, her, and pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. well i woke up in the middle of the night and i saw that the fire was dying out. so, i picked up a log and threw it on. or, at least what i thought was a log. 
<phoebe> oh my god!! you threw pepper on the fire! 
<joey> i wish. see, i guess another thing i probably shouldve told you about ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.  
<monica> oh my god! joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire? 
<joey> i ran!! 
< 
<chandler> well, thats the best kiss ive had with anyone ive ever met in a mens room.

<ross> yeah, oh hey, you are right on time. 
<rachel> so what do you say? can i be your girlfriend again? 
<ross> yes, you can, very much.  
<ross>  ahhhh!!  
< 
<phoebe> hey! 
<monica> hey. 
<phoebe> hey, why are you mopping your ceiling? 
<monica> oh, theres banana on it. 
<phoebe> wow, i have the spirit of an old indian women living in mine. 
<monica> so then you know?  
<phoebe> the mailman was downstairs, so i brought up your mail. 
<monica> oh, good. thanks. 
<phoebe> now what is fabutec? 
<monica> okay, all right dont judge me to much. okay? um, but i saw this info-mercial, and um, i swear to you i have never-ever bought anything on tv before, except for this mop. but there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing.... 
<phoebe> waxine!! 
<monica> yes! have you seen it? 
<phoebe> oh, its incredible! i so want to be a waxine girl. 
<monica> i know!! 
<phoebe> god. do think it really doesnt hurt? cause how can they do that? 
<monica> hello! organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest! 
<phoebe> they have the best stuff in there. 
< 
<chandler> oh my god! oh my god! 
<joey> yeah. we figured when we couldnt find you, youd gone home to make up with rachel. which is probably what you shoulda done. huh? 
<ross> you think?! god, i, ah, im in hell. i mean what, what am i gonna do? rachels all like, i love you and, and lets work on this. and all i can think about is, what is she gonna do? what is she gonna say? when i tell her what i did. 
<chandler> well, before we answer that, i think we should address the more important question. how dumb are you? 
<ross> what?! look, were trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. how am i supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other? 
<joey> look, ross look, im on board about this totally honesty thing, i am, just not about stuff thats gonna get you in trouble. 
<chandler> hes right. nobodys gonna benefit, and youre just gonna hurt her. 
<joey> yeah, and there wont be a relationship left to rebuild. 
<ross> yeah, but dont you think.... 
<chandler> all right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timings right. and thats what deathbeds are for. 
<ross> yeah, okay.  
<joey> all right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesnt find out some other way.  did you think about the trail? 
<ross> what trail? 
<joey>  the trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!  you always have to think about the trail! 
<ross> oh, i-i dont think theres any trail. 
<chandler> okay, okay-okay, ah, chloe works with that guy issac. issacs sister is jasmine. and jasmine works at that message place with phoebe. and phoebes friends with rachel. and thats the trail, i did it! 
< 
<phoebe>  after applying the waxine and linen strips to leg number one, 
<monica> did that! 
<phoebe> grasp one of the linen strips by its easy grab tab and pull it off in one quick pain free motion. 
<monica> okay.  ow!!!!! ow-oh-oh! 
<phoebe> was it not pain-free? 
<monica> no. it was painful. oh my god , they should call it pain-zine, now with a little wax. 
<phoebe> huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial dont seem to think its that bad. 
<monica> thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. but hey, y'know if you dont believe me, please, by my guest. 
<phoebe>  ow-ow-ow-ow! oh my god!!! 
<monica> now, are you glad we didnt start with the bikini strips? 
< 
<ross>  chloe? hi.. 
<s> is this about me taking your watch? 
<ross> you took my watch? 
<s> im sorry, i do that. 
<ross> just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us? 
<s> oh no. i feel it isnt really anybodys business, y'know. 
<ross> exactly. so you didnt, didnt mention anything to issac right? 
<s> oh, well i tell issac everything. 
<ross> you tell, of course you do. issac. issac. hey, issac. issac, hi! y'know we havent actually met... 
<s> you dog! 
<ross> yes, i suppose i am a dog. but issac, see i-i happen to have a girlfriend. 
<s> oh right, that rachel chick from the coffee place. 
<ross> yeah, thats the one. listen, i dont want to hurt her. 
<s> oh, hey, man i know, doesnt matter how much we love em, monogamy is too cruel a rule. 
<ross> yeah. listen, can you keep this information to yourself? 
<s> aw, no problem dude. y'know we got to look out for each other. were the same, you and me. 
<ross> actually, no, were not. 
<s> yeah, we are. 
<ross> no, were not. 
<s> yeah, we are. 
<ross> no, were not!! 
<s> okay, were not. 
<ross> right. 
<s> but, we are. 
<ross> fine. i just need to know that youre not gonna tell your sister. 
<s> i can promise not to tell her again. 
< 
<ross>  jasmine? 
<s> uh-huh. 
<ross> we met at phoebes birthday party, im, im ross geller. 
<s> you did a bad thing! 
<ross> yes, i did. 
<s> very bad! 
<ross> very bad. 
<s> very, very bad. 
<ross> im agreeing with you. did you, listen, did you happen to tell phoebe yet? 
<s> no. 
<ross> okay, jasmine, please, please dont. i love my girlfriend very much, and i want more than anything to just work it out with her. okay? 
<s> all right. 
<ross> thank you, thank you. 
<s> but you should probably talk to my roommate, because i told him and he knows phoebe too. 
<ross>  whos your roommate? 
< 
<ross> gunther! gunther. gunther, please tell me you didnt say anything to rachel about me and the girl from the xerox place. 
<s> im sorry. was i not supposed to?  commercial break 
< 
<monica> ow! 
<phoebe> oh!! 
<monica> ow!! ow!! 
<phoebe> ow!!!  
<phoebe> were all right. 
<monica> its okay, its okay. 
<phoebe> were all right. 
<monica> we were just waxing our legs. 
<chandler> off?!! 
<phoebe> for your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience. 
<chandler> yeah, well i dont think you can make that statement, unless youve been kicked in an area that god only meant to be treated nicely. 
<joey> yeah, i-i think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, thats all. i mean, come on, its just a little wax. 
<phoebe> oh yeah, come here.  
<chandler> oh, thats mature. 
<joey> okay, fine, so now what, i just pull it off? 
<phoebe> uh-huh. 
<monica> thats right.   
<ross>  come on, rachel, come on! talk to me! please!!  
<rachel> i cant talk to you. i cant even look at you right now! 
<monica> what? 
<chandler> nothing, nothing. 
<monica>  rachel said everything was okay. 
<phoebe>  what, what are they talking about? 
<ross> rachel?  
<rachel> just get away from me! 
<ross> no, it was a mistake! i made a mistake! okay? 
<rachel> a mistake?! what were you trying to put it in? her purse?!  
<phoebe> whe-where did he put it?!  
<rachel> ross, you had sex with another woman!  
<monica> oh my god. 
<phoebe> oh, i knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday. 
<chandler> yeah, well, i guess they had a fight, and he got drunk.... 
<monica> oh!!  you guys knew about this and you didnt tell us?! 
<chandler>  he has sex, and we get hit in our heads.  
<rachel>  y'know what, i want you to leave! get outta here! 
<ross> no!! 
<rachel> just get out! now!! 
<ross> no!! no!! i wanna stay. i wanna talk about this. 
<rachel> okay! all right! how was she?  
<chandler> uh-oh.  
<ross> what? 
<rachel> was she good?  
<joey> dont answer that.  
<rachel> come on ross! you said you wanted to talk about it, lets talk about it!! how was she? 
<ross> she was...  
<joey> awful! horrible! 
<chandler> she was not good. not good. 
<joey> she was nothing compared to you.  
<ross> she, she was different.  
<joey> ewwwww! 
<chandler> uh-oh.  
<rachel> good different? 
<ross> nobody likes change.  
<ross> what? okay, okay, okay, okay.  
<phoebe> should we do something? 
<chandler> yeah, never cheat on rachel.  
<ross> im sorry, okay, im sorry. i wa-i was disgusted with myself, and this morning i was so, i was so upset and then i got your message and i was so happy, and all i wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible. 
<rachel> whoa!! whoa, whoa, wait a minute. what time did your little friend leave?  oh my god. she was there? she was still there? she was in there, when i was in there?!  
<ross> listen. oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me! 
<rachel> and yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!  
<ross> look, i didnt think there was a relationship to jeopardise. i thought we were broken up. 
<rachel> we were on a break! 
<ross> that, for all i knew would, could last forever. that to me is a break-up. 
<rachel> you think youre gonna get out of this on a technicality? 
<ross> look, im not trying to get out of anything, okay. i thought our relationship was dead! 
<rachel> well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!  
<joey> y'know what, i dont think we should listen to this anymore.  
<monica>  what, what are you doing? you cant go out there. 
<joey> why not?!  im hungry. 
<monica> because theyll know weve been listening.  
<rachel> god! and to have to hear about it from gunther!! 
<ross> come on! like i wanted him to tell you, i ran all over the place trying to make sure that didnt happen! 
<rachel> oh, that is so sweet. i think im falling in love with you all over again.  
<chandler> y'know what, i think we can go out there. i mean they have more important things to worry about. 
<joey> yeah, well be fine.  
<ross> look rachel, i wanted to tell you, i thought i should, i-i did, and then chandler and joey convinced me not to.  
<chandler>  wax the door shut, were never leaving, ever.  
<phoebe> hi, its phoebe. listen someones gonna have to take my nine with mr. rehack, cause its like nine fifteen now, and im not there.  
<ross> dont you realise none of this wouldve ever happened if i didnt think at that same moment you werent having sex with mark? 
<rachel> all right. lets say i had slept with mark. would you have been able to forgive me? 
<ross>  yes i would. 
<rachel> youd be okay if you knew that mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me? 
<ross>  yes. 
<rachel> you knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were.... 
<ross>  la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! okay, okay, yeah, i would have been devastated but, i would still want to be with you. because its, i mean its you.  
<s> ohhhhh!  
<ross> what? come on rach, tell me what youre thinking? 
<rachel> im thinking, im gonna order a pizza. 
<ross> order a pizza like, i forgive you?   
<joey> oh man, pizza? i like pizza.  put olives on the pizza. 
<phoebe> we could eat the wax! its organic. 
<chandler> oh great, food with hair on it. 
<phoebe> no, not the used wax. 
<chandler> because that would be crazy?  
<ross> hey, can i, can i get in on that? because im kinda hungry myself. 
<rachel> fine.  hi! yes, id like to order a large pizza. 
<ross> no anchovies. 
<rachel> with ah, extra anchovies. 
<ross> thats okay, ill just pick em off. 
<rachel> yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?  
<ross> you can have the last piece, if you want. 
<rachel> well, i should think so. you slept with someone.  
<phoebe> theyre gonna get through this, arent they? 
<chandler> yeah, come on, its ross and rachel, theyve got too. 
<monica> what if they dont?  
<joey> you think i need a new walk? 
<chandler> what? 
<joey> well y'know, ive been walking the same way since high school. y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. i think i need a take notice walk. 
<chandler> are you actually saying these words?  
<ross> what, now youre not even taking to me?  look rachel, i-im sorry, okay, im sorry, i was out of my mind. i thought id lost you, i didnt know what to do. come on! come on, how insane must i have been to do something like this? huh? i-i dont cheat right, i, thats not me, im not joey!  
<joey> whoa-ho-ho!  yeah, okay. 
<monica> hey. its three in the morning. they dont know that ive come home yet. you notice how neither one of them are wondering where i am. 
<phoebe> yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.  
<ross> y'know what, y'know what, im-im not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. youre the one that bailed on us. youre the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough! 
<rachel> thats.... 
<ross> thats what?! 
<rachel> that is neither here nor there. 
<ross> okay, well here we are. now were in a tough spot again, rach. what do you want to do? how do you want to handle it? huh? do you wanna fight for us? or, do you wanna bail?  look, i,  i did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. okay? and im sorry, i wish i could take it back, but i cant.  i just cant see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. rachel, i love you so much.  
<rachel> no ross!!  dont! you cant just kiss me and think youre gonna make it all go away, okay? it doesnt work that way. it doesnt just make it better. okay? 
<ross> okay, okay, okay. 
<rachel>  i think you should go. 
<ross> what? 
<rachel>  i really think you need to go now. 
<ross>  okay, okay. this morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldnt work past it together... 
<rachel> yeah, what the hell did i know! 
<ross> look, look, theres got to be a way we can work past this. okay,  i cant imagine, i cant imagine my life without you.  without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. your good heart rach,  and, and.... 
<rachel>  no. i cant, youre a totally different person to me now. i used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. god, and now i just cant stop picturing with her, i cant,  it doesnt matter what you say, or what you do, ross. its just changed, everything. forever.  
<ross>  yeah, but this cant be it, i mean.  
<rachel> then how come it is? closing credits 
< 
<phoebe> theyve been quiet for a long time. 
<joey> maybe she killed him? 
<chandler> lets go.  
<chandler>  is that your new walk? 
< 
<joey> can i see the comics? 
<chandler> this is the new york times. 
<joey> okay, may i see the comics?  
<monica> guys. i thought you were taking ross to the game? 
<chandler> we are. hes meeting us here. 
<monica> no! rachel is meeting us here. 
<phoebe> oh come on, they can be in the same room. 
<joey> yeah, you shoulda been there last night. 
<phoebe> why? what happened now? 
<joey> well ross was hangin out over at our place, rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from chandler.... 
<chandler> yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? rachel came over to borrow something. 
<joey> anyway! her and ross just started yelling at each other. 
<phoebe> wait. why was he yelling at her? hes the one who slept with someone else. 
<joey> well, i guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now. 
<phoebe> whoa!! he is soo unreasonable! god, although i think i understand what he means. oh my god, this is like 60 minutes, okay, when, when, at first youre really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow. 
<chandler> y'know what this is like? this is like when my parents got divorced. man, i hope ross doesnt try to kidnap me after cub scouts. 
<phoebe> y'know i had a dream where ross and rachel were still together, they never broke up. and we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy.... 
<joey> i had the same dream! 
<phoebe> yeah, and nobody slept with that xerox girl. 
<joey> oh, i had the opposite dream. 
<chandler> y'know what maybe its gonna be okay, i mean its been a week. 
<joey> yeah, i mean its never taken me a week to get over a relationship. 
<monica> its never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.  
<monica>  okay, lets go!! lets hit the road!! 
<rachel> hey! 
<monica> lets get the show on it!

<rachel> ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.

<rachel> no! no, i am not getting in a car with ross, we will just have to live here! 
<phoebe> but if... 
<rachel> no you guys, i am not getting in a car with him, youll have to think of something else.

<ross> oh, now you want a favour? 
<phoebe> yes, please.

<ross> no, im not gonna pick them up. 
<s> listen, we both know youre gonna do it cause youre not a jerk. okay? so you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car. 
<ross> no, rachel doesnt want me to.... 
<s> look, i-i-i am sorry that rachel dumped you cause she fell in love with that mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but dont punish your friends for what rachel did to you.

<chandler> oh.  nope, that patch is no good.  
<rachel> come on, its a hypnosis tape. this woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasnt smoked since. 
<ross> pffhah. 
<rachel>  whats your problem? 
<ross> nothing, its just that hypnosis is beyond crap. 
<rachel> ross, i watched you get hypnotised in atlantic city. 
<ross> hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! okay. 
<rachel> oh right, cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play wipe-out on your butt cheeks. 
<phoebe> all right, y'know forget hypnosis. the way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men. 
<chandler> or what my father called thursday night. opening credits

<phoebe> wow, kids. frank, are you sure youre ready for that? 
<s> i mean, how hard can it be? y'know, i mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesnt want babies right? and besides y'know, i never had a dad around, and ah, now-now i always will, cause y'know, itll be me. right? 
<s> y'know, i mean, really we do realise that theres an age difference between us. 
<phoebe> oh good! okay. cause you were acting like you didnt. 
<s> oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?  
< completely asleep. you dont need to smoke. cigarettes dont control you. you are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. a strong, confident woman. 
< 
<monica> and y'know what, i just realised, in the last year ive only gone out with two guys, richard and julio. you gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game. 
<rachel> well, that shouldnt be a problem. i mean i work in fashion and all i meet are eligible straight men.

<monica> havent you and i covered that topic? 
<s> hmm, come on, you just said to her that you . 
<monica> aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that i serve you food. 
<s> well, if that were true, id dating my aunt ruth. and the two times we went out were just plain awkward.  come on, you think she should go out with me, dont you? 
<rachel>  well, i mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? i mean that aint a pretty picture in the morning, yknow what i mean. that wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.

<s> ho-ho, i will. 
< 
<phoebe> no, i know, i know, that this is franks life,  y'know. y'know, i dont want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, its sick and wrong! 
<ross> pheebs, what, is it the age thing? 
<phoebe> no-no, oh, im fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking its tongue down my little brothers throat! 
<joey> pheebs, he seems to enjoy it. 
<phoebe> but, i mean, do you think hes gonna enjoy it when hes up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! this is not fair to frank,  and it-its not fair to the babies, and y'know what, its not good home economics. 
<joey> well, have-have you told him how you feel? 
<phoebe> yes. not out loud. 
<ross> pheebs, if you dont tell him, soon hes gonna be married, and then youre gonna hate yourself.

<s> umm, im still here. 
<s>  youre taking this all wrong. because, if i didnt leave you that tip, you wouldnt of come down here, we wouldnt be having this argument, and there wouldnt be this ah, heat between us. 
<monica> what?! 
<s> come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. cause you used to be like the chef, and i was the customer, and now were like this-this couple that fights.

<phoebe> what umm, what happened? 
<s> umm, alice ah, she ah, called it off. 
<phoebe> oh no. did umm, did she say why? 
<s> uh, no, not really, just that i was too young, y'know, but i dont see how i could all of the sudden be too young, cause im older than i was when we first got together. 
<phoebe> yeah, yeah, no, i dont, i dont know. but, y'know what, maybe its just all for the best? 
<s> yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!

<joey>  that guys like a cartoon. what do you see in him anyway? 
<s> he happens to be brilliant. which is more than i can say for that sweater youre dating.

<joey> how do you mean? 
<s> well, adrians looking for a reason to stay, right? victor cant just kiss her, hes gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know? 
<joey> maybe he could slip her the tongue. 
<s> or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up. 
<joey> yeah, yeah, and then adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist. 
<s> and then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach! 
<joey> and then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her! 
<s> and then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....  
<joey> something like that? 
<s> yeah, thats pretty much what i had in mind. 
<joey> yeah. commercial break 
< 
<joey>  hey. 
<ross> hi. 
<joey>  hey.  
<ross> hi. 
<joey> hey.  
<ross> its a little early to be drinkin. 
<joey> no-no, things ah, finally happened with kate. 
<ross> ohhhhh! 
<monica> youre kidding?! thats great! 
<joey> oh, it was so amazing. after the  love making... 
<monica> oh my. 
<joey> yep. i just, i just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. and then i knew she was dreaming cause, cause her eyes keep going like this.  
<chandler>  im telling ya, joannas got it all wrong. okay? all i said was, this was fun. lets do it again sometime. ill give you a call. 
<rachel> ohh, gee. i wonder why she thinks youre going to call her? 
<chandler> thats what you say at the end of a date. 
<rachel> you cant just say, nice to meet you, good night? 
<chandler> to her face? look its the end of the date, im standing there, i know all shes waiting for is for me to say ill call her and its just y'know, comes out. i cant help it, its a compulsion. 
<monica> come on rach, when a guy says hes going to call, it doesnt mean hes going to call. hasnt it ever happened to you? 
<rachel> well, they always called. 
<monica> hmm, bite me. 
< 
<s>  did he call? 
<rachel> no. sorry. 
<s> why?! why?! he said hed call. why hasnt he called? 
<s> maybe hes intimated by really smart, strong, successful women. 
<s> sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. why hasnt he called, rachel? why? 
<rachel> okay, okay. umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss. 
<s> awkward? why should he feel awkward? 
<rachel> well... 
<s> the only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didnt tell him not to call me, did you? 
<rachel> no. i... 
<s> because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that. 
< 
<rachel>  call her! call her now! 
<chandler> multiple, so many paper cuts. 
<rachel> why hasnt he called rachel? why? why? i dont understand. why? he said hell call. why? why? chandler im telling you she has flipped out, shes gone crazy! 
<chandler>  oh, well give me the phone then. 
<rachel> come on, this isnt funny. she thinks its my fault that you havent called her. you have to call her! 
<chandler> look, you cant call somebody after this long just to say, in case you didnt notice, i dont like you! 
<rachel> well then youre going to have to take her out again. 
<chandler> nooo!! shes really dull! and she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye! 
<rachel> i dont care! i dont care! you are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows its actually ended. and, i dont care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again! 
<chandler> all right! fine! but its just a lunch date, no more than an hour! and from now on i get my own dates, i dont want you setting me up with anybody ever again! 
<rachel> thats fine! 
<chandler> thats just a lot of big talk, y'know. 
<rachel> i know.

<chandler> im sorry. im-im-im sorry that i said i was going to when im not. look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? and this isnt rachels fault. its me. i have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. i have issues with commitment, intimacy,  mascara goop. and im really sorry, its just that this is not, this isnt going to work out.

<ross> well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign. 
<joey> well what is it?! 
<ross> he couldn't even tell me! he said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. and the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it. 
<chandler> y'know what? you should go to my guy, because when i went in there with my third nipple. he just lopped it right off. y'know? so i guess i'm lucky. i mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples. 
<ross> at least they knew what yours was. y'know, yours had a name. 
<joey> oh! maybe they'll name yours after you! y'know, they'll call it, the ross. and then people would be like, "awww, he's got a ross." 
<ross>  yeah, that'd be cool!  
<monica> pete's breaking up with me. 
<s> what?! 
<monica> i just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from atlanta, we need to talk. 
<rachel> and? 
<monica> well that's it. people never say `we need to talk' unless it's something bad. 
<joey> whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you. 
<monica> really?! 
<joey> yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.

<phoebe> yeah, i like vince a lot, y'know? but, its just jasons so sensitive, y'know? and in the long run, i think sensitive its just better than having just like a really, really, really nice  butt.  jason! definitely jason! okay, wish me luck!

<phoebe>  oh, you so would! oh, you should get that anyway.  like for clubbing. 
<monica> it is so weird, i know what i said, but uh, this morning, i was lying in bed i was, i was imagining what it would be like to say yes.  i know its a little sudden, and its a little rushed, and its totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesnt mean i cant. right? i mean im-im crazy about pete, and i know that we want the same things, and when i thought about saying yes, it made me really happy. 
<rachel> oh my god.  
<monica> i know.  i need more pie.  
<phoebe> hey mon umm, if you do get married, can i bring two guests?

<chandler> excuse me, doug?  hey there sports fan!! 
<s>  bing! you got those numbers for me? 
<chandler> no, i ah, i didnt do them. 
<s> oh, you forgot? 
<chandler> no, no i just ah, didnt do them. instead, i ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so i certainly dont deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise. 
<s> well, i got tanked myself last night. pretty dicey drive home, tapanzi bridge never looked smaller.  thats okay, youre still my number one guy!  bing! 
<chandler> doug!! 
<s> hmm. 
<chandler> im a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself. 
<s> oh, is it the swearing? i mean is it the constant swearing? because i gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass! 
<chandler> no, no. it-its not about the swearing, its more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock. 
<s> oh? 
<chandler> oh, and dont get me wrong, i appreciate the sentiment. its just that i, i have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, its making all the other guys jealous. 
<s> well, say no more. y'know it takes guts to bring this up. bing! youre okay. 
<chandler> okay.  
<s> ha!  ahhhhhhh! 
<chandler> ahhhhh!  
<

<phoebe> oh no! that really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive. 
<rachel> ohh!  phoebe, this is all your fault! now he loves her, hes gonna marry her, and this is all your fault. 
<phoebe> you said it was okay! 
<rachel> you said she was bald!! 
<phoebe> what?! what-what-what-what-what?!! 
<rachel> phoebe, we cant, we just cant just let it happen! okay, we have to do something! we have to break them up! okay? just go in there and like, shave her head! you owe me one bald girl!! 
<phoebe> okay, first of all, breathe. second of all, i dont get it. arent you the one that decided that you didnt want to be with ross? 
<rachel>  yes. 
<phoebe> well isnt he your friend? dont you want him to be happy?

<s> i cant until im the ultimate fighter. i will do it. im telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or superman. now, im not saying i could beat superman, but y'know, kids are stupid. 
<monica> sit down. all right? please, just listen to me. you are terrible at this! okay? you are the worst ultimate fighter ever! ever!! 
<s> y'know i have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised adams apple, but that really hurt. 
<monica> well then, y'know what? i care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. so if you have to do this, then youre gonna have to do it without me. 
<s> well if youre asking me to quit, then youre asking me to be someone im not. ive got to do this. 
<monica> then ive gotta go. bye.

<s> ohh!!  
< 
<chandler>  so ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?! 
<s> all right, i was 15, it was my best friend, ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, i dont know, we were, we were making out.

<chandler> oh my god! if you say that one more time, im gonna break up with you! 
<ross> fine! fine! but this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  if you accept full responsibility...  full responsibility! ...i can begin to trust you again. does that seem like something you can do.  does it?!! 
<joey> no? 
<chandler> look, ross, you have what you want, youre back with rachel. if you bring this up now youre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you. 
<ross>  yeah, i know. i mean, no, youre right. yeah i guess ill let it go. but you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this. 
<joey> sure, its hard to forget! but that doesnt mean you have to talk about it! a lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about. 
<ross> what the hell happened on that beach?! 
<joey> its between us and the sea, ross!  
< 
<phoebe>  hi, ursula.

<ross>  hey, you guys! what do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing? 
<rachel> all right, thats it, you guys! what happened out there? 
<monica> what? we took a walk, nothing happened. i can back with nothing all over me. 
<ross> what happened? joey?

<chandler>  theyll never understand! 
<joey> well, we have to say something! we have to get it out! its eating me alive!! monica got stung by a jellyfish. 
<monica>  all right!! all right.  i got stung. stung bad. i couldnt stand. i-i couldnt walk. 
<chandler>  we were two miles from the house. scared and alone. we didnt think we could make it.  
<monica> i was in too much pain. 
<joey> and i was tired from digging the huge hole! 
<chandler> and then joey remembered something. 
<joey> id seen this thing on the discovery channel... 
<ross> wait a minute! i saw that! on the discovery channel, yeah! about jellyfish and how if you...  ewwww!! you peed on yourself?! 
<monica> you cant say that!! you-you dont know!! i mean i thought i was gonna pass out from the pain! anyway i-i tried, but i-i couldnt...bend that way. so...  
<joey> thats right i stepped up! shes my friend and she needed help! and if i had too, id pee on anyone of you! only, uhh, i couldnt. i got the stage fright. i wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. so-so i uh, i turned to chandler. 
<chandler>  joey kept screaming at me, do it now! do it!! do it! do it now!! sometimes late at night i can still here the screaming. 
<joey>  thats cause sometimes i just do it through my wall to freak you out. 
< 
<phoebe>  ...fuchsia and mauvvve. those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm.  thank you, thank you. ohh, and i invite you to count the colours in your bedroom.  except for you. you go away. hasnt been a day where i didnt regret giving you up. 
<phoebe> okay, bye. reason i didnt look you up was, well i was afraid that youd react, just well like, the way, the way youre reacting right now, and cant we just, y'know, start from here? 
<phoebe> no. im family, im it. now, now im done.

<rachel> ooh, i was soo nervous about that letter. but the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much youve grown. y'know? 
<ross>  i suppose. 
<rachel> you have! ross, you should give yourself credit. i mean my mom never thought this would work out. it was all, once a cheater, always a cheater. 
<ross>  umm-hmm. 
<rachel> ooh, i just wish we hadnt lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...

<phoebe> i just, i just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my mother. 
<rachel> you mean the mom you met in montauk. she was a cat?! 
<phoebe> no, no-no, she was a human lady. this is the spirit of my mom lily, the one who killed herself. 
<ross> are you sure shes in the cat, or have you been taking your grandmas glycoma medicine again? 
<phoebe> no dr. skeptismo! im sure. first of all, okay, theres the feeling.  okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt.  my mothers favourite fish is orange roughy...  cats....like....fish!  hi, mommy.  oh, i havent seen this smile in 17 years!

<monica> come on, that was back in high school! how could that still bother you? 
<rachel> i mean why, of all people would you want to go out with chip?! 
<monica> look, you and i went to different high schools... 
<rachel> okay, that doesnt help me, because we went to the same high school. 
<monica> you went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off chips motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. i went to one where i wore a band uniform they had to have specially made. 
<rachel>  they had to have that specially made?! 
<monica> it was a project for one of the home ec classes. 
<rachel>  oh my god, they told us that was for the mascot! 
<monica> back then, i thought that i would never, ever get the chance to go out with a chip matthews, and now hes-hes called me up and asked me out. and the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. i-i owe her this. i never let her eat. 
<rachel> oh, you go out with him.  
<monica> oh, really?! 
<rachel> yeah. just, if its possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy? 
<monica> ill try.

<ross> so you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center? 
<joey> well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, i dont think any of them are gonna work out. 
<chandler> yes, joey has a very careful screening process. apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails. 
<phoebe>  stop it! stop it! she keeps squirming, trying to get away! just like when she was alive. 
<ross> so pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us? 
<phoebe> well, im not sure. i mean, i guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that theres y'know, a new mom. y'know, i think shes worried that y'know, shes gonna, shes gonna be replaced.  well, thats not gonna happen is it? noo.  okay, i have to return a call in the other room. 
<monica> why cant you use the phone in here? 
<phoebe> well, im returning a call from a certain mom at the b-e-a-c-h. i just spelled the wrong word.  
<ross> so, guys, am i crazy, or does phoebes mom remind anyone of a cat? 
<monica> ross, dont start. 
<ross> come on, you-you cant tell me you actually believe that-that theres a woman inside that cat! 
<rachel> i believe it. 
<ross> no you dont. 
<rachel> yes, i do. 
<ross> no you doy'know what, youre not gonna suck me into this.

<ross>  hey! so ah, what did the insurance company say? 
<chandler> oh, they said uh, you dont have insurance here, so stop calling us. 
<ross>  you didnt tell her?!  okay, fine! pheebs? 
<phoebe> yeah?  hi! 
<ross> hi! listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. there are flyers all over the place. 
<rachel> im sorry, sweetie.  
<monica> hey, we can take her back with you if you want. 
<phoebe> ohh. um-hmm. but y'know, she choose to find me. i mean, i have to respect her decision. right? 
<ross> no! no! lookhey, enough is enough! look, i am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. this is a cat! okay, julio the cat! not mom! cat! 
<phoebe>  ross, how many parents have you lost? 
<ross> none. 
<phoebe> okay, then you dont know what it feels like when one of them comes back. do you? i believe this is my mother. even if im wrong, who cares? just be a friend. okay? be supportive. 
<ross> im sorry. 
<phoebe> okay. 
<ross> i dont know what to say. 
<rachel> you could.... say youre sorry to her mom. 
<phoebe> i think she would like that. 
<ross>  come here, here, come here, come here,  mrs. buffay. sorry, about what i said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. when clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friends mother. 
<phoebe> thank you. we both forgive you. 
<rachel> so honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl? 
<phoebe> yeah, okay, listen, umm, mom, i hope you know you still mean a lot to me. and youre welcome to come back anytime. 
<chandler> pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, wed really appreciate it.  
<phoebe> come on, mom, ill take you home. 
<rachel> ill go with you. 
<monica> me too.

< 
<monica>  how desperate am i? 
<rachel> oh! good thing chandlers not here, he always wins at this game. 
<monica> i just told my mom id cater a party for her. 
<phoebe> how come? 
<monica> because i need the money, and i thought that itd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect. 
<ross> come on, i think this is a good thing. i dont think mom wouldve hired you if she didnt think you were good at what you do. 
<monica> you dont have to stick up for her. she cant here you. 
< 
<rachel>  hey! umm, do you guys have any juice? 
<joey> just pickle. 
<chandler> hey uh, rach, funny story. i ah, bumped into joanna on the street yesterday. 
<rachel> my boss, joanna? wow, that mustve been awkward. 
<chandler> well, no, actually she uh, asked me if i wanted to get a drink. 
<rachel>  you ah, you didnt say yes to that did you? 
<chandler>  no. no! 
<s>  hello, rachel.  
<chandler> well, not at first. 
<rachel> what is she doing here?  
<rachel> i dont understand! last time you went out with her you said she was a big, dull dud. 
<chandler> well, i think i judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.  
<rachel> well, last time i almost got fired. you must end it, you must end it now! 
<chandler> oh, come on! its not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! i mean usually im pretty much just in there by myself.  
<rachel> chandler!!  promise me, you will end it. 
<chandler> okay, i promise, ill end it. 
<rachel> thank you. 
<chandler> i hope you know what im giving up for ya, because shes not just the boss in your office, if you know what i mean. 
<joey> yeah-eh-eah!  oh-oh, sorry, i-i knew what he meant. 
< 
<s>  hows the hired help? 
<monica> doing great, the quiches are coming along. 
<s> whats this? blue nail polish? 
<monica> yeah, i thought it was cute. 
<s> ahh, thats what your grandmothers hands looked like when we found her. 
<monica> let me ask you a question. 
<s> hmm. 
<monica> why did you hire me? 
<s> oh, well richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. then i heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, i assume you werent sleeping with anybody there. though, at least that would be something.  
<monica>  oh my god! did you hear that? she hired me because she thinks im good. 
<phoebe> okay, i didnt hear that. 
<monica> oh yeah, she didnt hire me out of pity, it wasnt so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks im good. 
<phoebe> wow! and hey, its cool if youre a lesbian!  
< are you the decision maker of the house? 
<joey> uhhhh.  
<joey> no! no. but ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there. ask you one question. do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though youre not really sure what theyre talking about?   
<ross> im telling you its totally unconstituional.   
<monica> i think he deserves a nobel prize.  
<s> nooo!!   
<chandler> it was like the algonquin kids table.   you havent said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all interested? 
<joey> yeah-well-yeah! yeah-oh-yeah. come on in. 
< 
<phoebe> thats weird. 
<monica> what? 
<phoebe> your nails. 
<monica> oh, i know, i never wear fake ones. i just did it so my mom wouldnt give me grief about me biting them. 
<phoebe> oh, no, i meant that its weird that you only have nine now. 
<monica>  oh my god. wait a minute, i had them put  oh my god! its in the quiche! oh my god! 
<phoebe> okay, dont panic. im gonna go to the store, im gonna get you another set of nails, no ones gonna know, and youre gonna look great.  oh! oh, its cause theyre gonna eatthats the problem. 
<s>  honey, dont bite your nails. 
<monica> okay ah, please dont freak out. umm, but ah, theres a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and theres no way to know which one. 
<phoebe> and! whoever finds it wins the prize! 
<s>  im not freaking out. 
<monica> then why are you laughing? 
<s> its nothing, its just that now your father owes me five dollars. 
<monica> what? you bet id lose a nail? 
<s> oh no, dont be silly. i just bet id need these.  
<monica> frozen lasagnas? 
<s> um-hmm. 
<monica> you bet that id screw up?! so all that stuff about hiring me because i was good was 
<s> no-no-no, that was all true. this was just in case you pulled a monica. 
<monica> you promised dr. weinburg, youd never use that phrase. 
<s> oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, youve never been able to laugh at yourself. 
<monica>  thats right. my mom doesnt have any faith in me! oh, thats hilarious! ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. 
<phoebe> i dont get it. 
<s> no, i have faith 
<monica>  no! you have lasagnas!  
<s> ding!

<s>  ill be back in ten minutes.  
<chandler> you are, youre gonna leave me like this?

<chandler>  rachel, could i see you for a moment?  
<chandler> okay, heres the situation. the keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? and on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit. 
<rachel> you promised you would break up with her! 
<chandler> i did break up with her! she just took it really, really well! 
<rachel> and the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?! 
<chandler> it did enter my mind! but then something happened that made it, shoot right out. 
<rachel> y'know what chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them. 
<chandler> no-no-no-no-no-no-no!! i cant get myself right out of them! you must have me confused with the amazing chandler!! come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and im cold, and

<chandler> never! 
<rachel> you never come into this office again! 
<chandler> fine!

<rachel> wait a minute! what are you gonna tell joanna? 
<chandler> about what? 
<rachel> when she sees that youre gone, shes gonna know that i let you out, and that i was in here, and im gonna get fired! 
<chandler> ill make something up! im good at lying, i actually did borrow your walkman! 
<rachel> no, theres nothing to make up, shes gonna know that i have a key to her office, ive got to get you locked up back the way you were!  
<chandler> oh-ho-ho, i dont think so!  
<chandler> well, this is much better.

<phoebe> well, who cares what your mom thinks? so you pulled a monica. 
<monica> oh good, im glad thats catching on. 
<phoebe> no but, why does that have to be a bad thing. just change what it means. y'know? go down there and prove your mother wrong. finish the job you were hired to do, and well call that pulling a monica. 
<monica> what? 
<phoebe> okay, umm, if a kid gets straight as, his parents would say, "yeah, he pulled a monica." y'know? or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "yeah i know, he pulled a monica." or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "yeah, that ones outta here." though some things dont change. 
<monica>  all right, ill go down there. but, im not gonna serve the lasagna. im gonna serve something i make.  
<phoebe> wow! my breasts are really strong.

<s>  well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish. 
<monica> and you? 
<s> i thought it was quite tasty. 
<monica> so if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. which would make you

<joey> well then, do it better! 
<chandler> okay, what do you saw i go over there and say how much i like her?  no-no it'll be good, i can tell her much i've been thinking about her. that i haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment i met her. that i'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day i can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!

<ross> at least i know she's not going out with me to get into r rated movies. 
<rachel> why don't you just marry her? oh no, wait a minute you can't, i'm sorry i forgot, she's not a lesbian.

<chandler> where did you, when did you, how did you...  how did you get a girl like that? 
<rachel> yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what? 
<ross> actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era. 
<chandler> okay, but that's, like, the easiest era. 
<ross> i've seen her at work, but i always figured, ah-huh? but, uh, i made her dinner. we had a great time. and we're going out again tomorrow.

<rachel> oh, the velveteen rabbit! oh my god, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real! 
<chandler> okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils. 
<rachel> huh. well, then you'd better keep it away from ross's hair. so this is pretty rare. how did you get that? 
<chandler> oh, it wasn't a big deal. i just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren. 
<rachel> oh, honey, that's so sweet. 
<phoebe> yeah, and what a great way to say, "i secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"

<phoebe> it's gotta be better than that book. oo! like a crossbow! 
<monica>  yeah, once again, i am sorry. thank you. bye.  i just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people. 
<rachel> oh my god! what happened? 
<monica> sixty guests. 
<ross> so, uh, why did you have to turn it down? 
<monica> because i don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. i mean there's no way. 
<phoebe> wow, what is with all the negativity? you sound like monican't , not monican...  ...monica. look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. do you want to be a caterer or not? 
<monica> i don't know. 
<phoebe> there you go, that's the spirit! okay! now, if you need money, i will lend you money, but just get moving! 
<monica> really? cause i'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff. 
<phoebe> okay! it's worth it, if it will get you moving. you haven't worked in months. 
<monica> well, you're not working either.

<rachel> no! i'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week i got all but three answers and i really want to finish a whole one without any help. 
<phoebe> fine. but you can't help me develop my new universal language.  
<monica> hey! 
<rachel> hey, how'd it go? 
<monica> oh my god, it was the best funeral ever! i mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? i even got another funeral for tomorrowthe dead-guy-from-today's best friend. i mean, it is like i am the official caterer for that accident! 
<phoebe> mon! i'm so happy for you! 
<monica> thanks. like, check out my new catering stuff.  look at this! i'm an omelet station! omelet? made to order! 
<phoebe> i'll have one, please. plus my money. 
<monica> oh. well, i didn't realize that you needed it back right away. i mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. so i went. i beed. i mean, i... i used it to buy all this stuff. but looki've got another job tomorrow, so i'll pay you back with the money i make from that.

<monica> no. i hate this part. 
<phoebe> oh, look what we almost left.

<rachel> yes! rent! 
<chandler> okay, so when do you want to go? 
<rachel> what? oh, i'm sorry, i can't, i'm busy. 
<joey>  hey. man, it is so hard to shop for girls. 
<chandler> yes, it is, at office max. 
<rachel> what did you get her?  
<chandler> a pen. 
<joey> it's two gifts in one. it's a pen that's also a clock! huh? 
<chandler> huh-huh! you can't give her that. 
<joey> why not? 
<chandler> because she's not eleven! and it's not the seventh night of hanukkah! 
<rachel> okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives? 
<joey> sure it is! she needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "whoa! it's time for my date with joey!" 
<chandler> all right, look, look. what did... what did you get for angela delveccio for her birthday? 
<joey> she didn't have a birthday while we were going out. 
<chandler> for three years? 
<joey>  look, it's too late, and i got an audition. i can't shop anymore! i... 
<chandler> all right. i will go out and i will try to find something for her, okay? 
<joey> thanks, man. and oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card? 
<chandler> would you like me to write her a little poem as well? 
<joey> or... just get a card that has a poem already in it. 
< 
<phoebe> but mon, you have to get our money! 
<monica> oh, phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! with those thick glasses, her tears looked giant. 
<phoebe> i know, it's tough. you know what the first thing i did after my mother's funeral was? 
<monica> what? 
<phoebe> pay the caterer! look, i've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. it's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "i don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. bad little white girl!" 
<monica> okay. so what do you.... you think she's faking? 
<phoebe> well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill. 
<monica> phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.  forever in peace may you wave.... 
<phoebe> she seems fine now. commercial break 
< 
<joey> so, you just left? her place was really that bad? 
<ross> you know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day? 
<joey> yeah. 
<ross> well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. and instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. and instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived!  here. 
<joey> wow. thanks. so, uh, what happened? 
<ross> what do you mean? nothing happened! i had to get out of there. 
<joey> all right, so... next time, you take her to your place. 
<ross> no, i tried that. she says it has a weird smell. 
<joey> what kind of smell? 
<ross> i don't know. soap? 
<joey> all right, listen, ross... you like this girl, right? 
<ross> yeah. 
<joey> you wanna see her again, right? 
<ross> yeah. 
<joey> so you're gonna have to do it in the mess! 
<ross> yeah, okay you're right. 
<joey> yeah. 
<ross> i mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness? 
<joey> yeah! 
<ross> it's, uh... it's endearing, really. 
<joey> all right! now you go get that beautiful pig!  oink! 
< 
<chandler> okay, all right. i just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for kathy that would be better than the rabbit. 
<rachel> any luck? 
<chandler> oh, yeah. yeah, i found this great place called "invisible things for kathy."  can you give me a hand with all this stuff? 
<rachel> all right, look. why don't you just return the book, let joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. like... a regular pen. 
<chandler> she's really going to love this, you know? the bottom line is i want her to have it, even if i don't get to be the one who gives it to her. 
<rachel> aw, honey, that's so sweet. 
<chandler> yeah? you don't think it's just pathetic? 
<rachel> oh! pathetic!  
<joey>  hey! i'm meeting kathy in ten minutes! i've been looking all over for you! 
<chandler> where? 
<joey> our place, the hall! i... 
<chandler> i got something for her.  it's a book! 
<joey>  a book?  is it like a book that's also a safe? 
<chandler> no, it's a book that's just a book, okay? it's an early edition of the velveteen rabbit. it was her favorite book as a kid. so, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay? 
<joey> you got it. thanks man. thanks for doing this, i owe you one.  oh, hey! there wasn't any change from that twenty, was there? 
<chandler> no, it came out to an even twenty. 
<joey> wow. that's almost as much as a new book. 
< creepers, where'd you get those eyes?  
<phoebe> you didn't get the money, did you? 
<monica> maybe i can try at intermission? phoebe, come on... you know what? let's just go! 
<phoebe> no! hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! i don't know who she thinks she is! enough is enough!  hey, widow? 
<phoebe> okay, widow! 
<phoebe> excuse me. excuse me!  thanks. um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'cause you know what, lady? we're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.

<chandler>  i just walked in the bathroom and saw kathy naked! it was like torture! 
<ross> y'know if we ever go to war and youre captured, youre in for a big surprise. 
<chandler> it just keeps getting worse and worse! y'know? i mean its bad enough that im in love with my roommates girlfriendwhich by the way, i think she knows. because every time were in the room together theres this weird like energy between us. and call me crazy, but i think she likes me too. and now i have seen her naked. i mean at least when ive seen her with clothes on, i could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. but there are no boles, shes smooth! smooth!

<chandler> wait! youre going out with kathy! 
<joey> yeah. why are you getting so upset? 
<chandler> well, im upsetfor you. i mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.  
<joey> what is the big deal? its not like were exclusive. 
<chandler> look, joey, kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. but casey, i mean granted i only saw the back of her head, but i got this sense that shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you. 
<joey> you got all that from the back of her head? 
<chandler> all right look, i think its time for you to settle down. y'know? make a choice, pick a lane.

<ross> yeah. 
<monica> he used to lock himself in the basement for hours. no one was every allowed to hear, "the sound."

< 
<ross> hey chandler! saw the new furniture. very nice. 
<monica> yeah! joey has the best boyfriend ever! 
<chandler> i kissed kathy. 
<ross> what? 
<monica> are you serious? 
<phoebe> does joey know? 
<chandler> no. is there anyway, anyway you think hell understand this? 
<monica> you obviously havent screwed over a lot of your friends.  which we all appreciate. 
<ross> no the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing joey, he probably just wouldve just stepped aside. 
<chandler> oh, dont say that! dont say that. thats not true. is it? 
<phoebe> i think maybe, yeah. 
<monica> he loves you. 
<chandler> then why didnt you tell me to do that?!! 
<ross> well, i said-i said something to phoebe. 
<phoebe> yeah! no, thats right. and i thought it was a really good idea. 
<rachel> i know, i remember that! 
<monica> i remember you did. 
<chandler> god!!  what am i gonna do?! 
<rachel> well, chandler, youre gonna have to tell him. 
<chandler> why?! why do i have to tell him?! 
<rachel> because you do. 
<chandler> yeah, i know. 
<ross> hey, would it be okay if i wrote a song about this. 
< 
<chandler> hey! 
<joey> hey! samboucha margarita? 
<chandler> is that a real thing? 
<joey> well, we only had samboucha, so it is now. 
<chandler> listen ah, joe, i-i need to, i need to talk to you about something. 
<joey> whats up? 
<chandler> its-its about kathy. umm, uh, i like her. i like her a lot actually. 
<joey> you do? 
<chandler> yeah. 
<joey> well, youre timing couldnt be better. shes not my girlfriend anymore. 
<chandler> what? 
<joey> yeah, she broke up with me. 
<chandler> oh uh, when? 
<joey> just now, after acting class. at first i thought she was doing some kind of scene, thats why i let people watch. 
<chandler> oh man, i am so sorry. are, are you okay? 
<joey> well, ive been better. but, im all right. so you like her huh? 
<chandler> yes, but i-i uh, dont have too. 
<joey> no-no-no, no its uh, its okay. 
<chandler> yeah? 
<joey> yeah. you know why? cause you came to me first. 
<chandler> well, i thought that would be the best thing to do. 
<joey> but hey, listen just so you know, you might have youre work cut out for you. cause when i talked to her, i kinda got the feeling that shes into some other guy. so 
<chandler> see uh, thats-thats actually what i wanted to talk to you about. i-i think i know who the other guy is. 
<joey> who? 
<chandler> its me. im the other guy. 
<joey> what? 
<chandler> yeah, i mean when you were late last night, kathy and i got to talking, and one thing to another and 
<joey> and what?! did you sleep with her?! 
<chandler> no! no! no! i just kissed her. 
<joey> what?!! thats even worse!! 
<chandler> how is that worse?! 
<joey> i dont know! but its the same! 
<chandler> look, im sorry! but theres nothing i can do, i think im in love with her! 
<joey> who cares?! you went behind my back! i would never do that to you! 
<chandler> youre right, i have no excuses! i was totally over the line. 
<joey> over the line?! you-youre-youre so far past the line, that you-you cant even see the line! the line is a dot to you! 
<chandler> yes. yes! right! and i feel horrible. you have to believe me! 
<joey> is that why you bought all this stuff?!  well, yknow what i will not watch your tv, i will not listen to your stereo, and theres a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that im not gonna eat! you know why?! 
<chandler> probably because 
<joey> because its all tainted with your betrayal. from now on this apartment is empty for me! and im not happy about you either.  oh, and just so you know, i made that bread for you.  closing credits

<phoebe> oh my god, hes lost it. hes totally lost it.

<rachel> so are things with you and joey any better? 
<chandler> they couldnt be worse. i spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me. 
<rachel> oh wow, eight hours? so you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh? 
<ross> should we all expect christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office? 
<rachel> you shouldnt. 
<phoebe> speaking of christmas, umm since monica and i are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret santa, and then we each only buy one gift. and-and theres the added mystery of who gets who. 
<ross> who gets whom.  i dont know why i do that.  
<rachel> well, im gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy. 
<monica> we havent eaten yet! 
<rachel> i know, but all that work youre doing to get it ready, i just  
<chandler> hey, by any chance did either of pick uh rachel for your secret santa, cause i wanna trade for her. 
<phoebe> i picked her! oh thank god you want her! ooh! 
<chandler> wow! why do you want to get rid of her so badly? 
<phoebe> because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, its like impossible to get her something she likes. come on, lets trade! 
<chandler> oh thats not true! thats not true! i got her that backpack and she loved it! i remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it  oh, there was no big dog. all right this sucks! i already got her this briefcase, and i had r.g. put on it  her initials 
<phoebe> ohh. 
<monica> well, maybe you could give to somebody else. ooh, like ross geller. 
<chandler> op, y'know what though, its kindve a girlie briefcase. 
<monica> who cares? he works in a museum! 
<chandler> hey, what time is it? the big game is about to start! 
<phoebe> you dont have to do that, ross and joey arent here, you can watch the parade if you want. 
<chandler> thanks. 
<monica> what is wrong with this freezer?!  ow! ow!! 
<phoebe> god, what happened?! 
<monica> oh my god, ice just got in my eye! 
<rachel>  people are trying to sleep in here! 
<chandler> monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts. 
<phoebe> open it up, let me see. 
<monica> oh, yknow what, i cant, it really kills. 
<chandler> well maybe you should put some ice on it. 
<phoebe> ooh, god it looks bad. 
<rachel> honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor. 
<monica> no, my eye doctor is richard! i cant go to him when i dont have a boyfriend! 
<chandler> hes really picky about his patients. 
<phoebe> honey, youve got to go. whats his office number? 
<monica> like i remember his office number!  speed dial 7. 
<phoebe>  hi! yeah, im calling on behalf of monica gellers eye, and is um, is richard burke in today.  hes out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor? 
<monica> yes!! 
<phoebe> yes! shes very excited about that.  
<phoebe> this is so cool, til monica gets back, its like im head chef and i get to make all the decisions.  
<ross> hey-hey, i thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly! 
<phoebe> okay, get out of my kitchen! 
<chandler>  all right! okay! i think i am making some progress with joey, when i went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once!  i mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it. 
<phoebe> all right i i gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question. 
<ross> so listen ah, i picked monica for secret santa, but im already getting her something for chanukah, i was wondering if you wanna switch. 
<chandler> oh yknow what, i was already trying to trade for ah, well, you. 
<ross> really?! wow! thats-thats so nice, what are you gonna get me? 
<chandler> i dont know r.g., i was thinking something girlie for your office. 
<ross> yeah, well maybe phoebe will switch with me. 
<chandler> oh no-no-no, you dont want to do that, then youre gonna get stuck with rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets. 
<ross> oh, thats not true! ive got her lots of stuff she never took back. 
<chandler> like? 
<ross> like uh, that gold necklace i got her last year. 
<chandler> when was the last time you saw her wear it? 
<ross> well, she wore it all christmas day, and then uh 
<chandler> big dog? 
< 
<ross>  hey! 
<joey> hey! 
<ross> what are you doing? 
<joey> im sending back all this stuff that chandler bought out of guilt. 
<ross> everything? even the tv? 
<joey> no! im putting that in my room. 
<ross> listen, joey, i know what he did was wrong but dont you think you could at least hear the guy out? 
<joey> back when you and rachel were together, if chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out? 
<ross> thats a good point. so uh, how long are you gonna punish him? 
<joey> five years. 
<ross> youve sentenced him?! 
<joey> hey! dont do the crime if you cant do the time. 
<ross> joey, the guys your best friend. 
<joey> no, was my best friend. anyway, i dont know why youre pushing for him so hard. with him out of the way as my best friend, theres a spot open. 
<ross> oh, who? me? 
<joey> yeah! 
<ross> wow! im honored! and yknow what im gonna do as my first act as your best friend? 
<joey> what? 
<ross> im gonna get you to talk to chandler. 
<joey> all right. but if you werent my best friend. 
< 
<s> oh my god, is it really that bad? 
<chandler> i walk into a room and he wont even talk to me, he just mumbles something in italian. and i know he only knows the bad words. 
<joey>  hey gunther, have you uh, have you seen chandler? 
<s> i thought you were chandler. but umm, one of who is over there.  
<s> oh.

< 
<chandler> hey! im sorry! that where are you going? 
<joey> my folks. 
<chandler> oh, uh, when-when are you coming back? 
<joey> i dont know. i might stay there for a few days while i look for an apartment. 
<chandler> what?! 
<joey> yeah, yknow at first i thought we could talk about this yknow, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together i dont think i 
<chandler> hey, look, what do you want me to say? do you want me to say that ill stop seeing her? 
<joey> look, its not about her. okay? but seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. and i dont want to live with some one who doesnt know what it is to be a friend. so, ill see ya.  
<chandler> hey, look, i know what it is to be a friend, i just-i just screwed up! 
<joey> yeah! you did! and thats why im leaving.  
<chandler> all right look, if youre not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! okay, they have had a very difficult year! what with the robbery and all! 
<joey> when that guy was robbing us, and i was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what i was doing in there all that time? i was thinking about how i let you down! 
<chandler> what? 
<joey> yeah! but if wouldve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, i wouldnt have worried about it so much! see you around! 
<chandler> all right, wait! come on! just wait one second! there has to be something that i can do! something! if we still had that entertainment unit i would get in it for six hours and think about how i let you down.  what? 
<joey> weve got a box.  commercial break 
< 
<s> last time i saw you, it was the morning i left for college. and you were just standing outside the dairy queen. 
<monica> i was probably waiting for it to open. 
<s> i gotta tell you, you look great now. 
<monica> you look great too. 
<s> youre an excellent patient! 
<monica> so how does it look? 
<s> well, youve got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days. 
<monica> like a pirate?! 
<s> if that helps you. 
<monica> umm, so how long have you been working with your dad?  come on, one of us had to mention him. 
<s> i moved back here a couple of months ago. 
<monica> oh. big family dinner tonight? 
<s> uh.  
<monica> no way! 
<s> i was gonna have thanksgiving at my girlfriends. 
<monica>  oh. 
<s> but we broke up. 
<monica>  oh. 
<s> she-she wasnt ready for a serious commitment. 
<monica>  oh.  so you made her walk the plank? aye, matie? 
<s> youre not wearing the patch yet. 
<monica> i know. 
< 
<ross> hes coming here for thanksgiving! 
<rachel> i know, its sick. 
<monica> why is it sick? 
<rachel> because its richards son! its like inviting greek tragedy over for dinner! 
<monica> hey, come on, phoebe, you understand dont you? 
<phoebe> yeah, i can see where id be your best shot but, no. im sorry, but i think its twisted. 
<ross> yeah. 
<joey>  whats twisted? 
<monica> me going out with richards son. 
<joey> ewwwww!! ew! ew! ew! 
<chandler>  sounds like a really bad idea to me. 
<rachel> is he okay in there? 
<joey> hes fine! 
<ross> hey, y'know, mon, if things wrong out between you and richards son, youd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather. 
<monica> fine! judge all you want to but,  married a lesbian,  left a man at the altar,  fell in love with a gay ice dancer,  threw a girls wooden leg in a fire,  livin in a box!!  
<rachel> so now, what exactly is the point of the box? 
<joey> chandler? 
<chandler> the meaning of the box is three fold. one , it gives me the time to think about what i did. two , it proves how much i care about my friendship with joey. and three , it hurts! 
<ross>  oh hey! hey uh, you remember the necklace i gave you last year? can i see it? 
<rachel>  why? 
<ross> i just wanna check something. 
<rachel> okay.  
<ross>  now, well see. 
<chandler> air hole! air hole!!  
<rachel>  here it is! i love it. i wear it all the time. 
<ross>  the necklace i got you was gold, this one is silver. 
<rachel> huh, well maybe it uh, it changed. 
<ross> oh my god! you actually exchanged it! 
<rachel> well isnt it better that i exchanged it for something that i enjoy and that i can get a lot of use out of? 
<ross> what did you get? 
<rachel> credit.

<s> thank you. 
<rachel> fancy soap? i thought we were savin that for the pope! 
<monica> see hes nice. right? 
<phoebe> yeah, but monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "thats not how your dad used to do it." 
<s> wow! everything looks great! where should i sit? 
<monica> i saved you a seat.  
<rachel>  sick-sick-sick-sick.  
<phoebe> oh, ill get it.  
<chandler> gotcha!  
<joey> that doesnt sound like thinking to me! 
<chandler> sorry! 
<joey> yknow i dont think you should be talking at all in there! i think youve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes! 
<chandler> okay, okay, you got it! 
<rachel> ross, can you pass me the yams? 
<ross> sure! oh, and joeys got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them. 
<rachel> would you stop?! what is the matter with you?! 
<monica> oh-ho-ho, weve got company. 
<ross> theres nothing the matter with me. see, im not completely devoid of sentiment, see i have feelings. 
<rachel> okay, fine.   
<chandler> you cant tell, but im trying to break the tension by mooning you guys! 
<joey> all right, look! if this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! this means something to me! and if it doesnt mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise youre just an idiot in a box! 
<chandler> youre right, and im sorry! this means a lot to me! i want you to be my friend again! i swear, i wont say another word tonight. 
<joey> so are you gonna start taking this thing seriously? 
<chandler> absolutely! 
<joey> that sounds like another word to me! are you gonna take this seriously?  okay.  
<rachel> dont say that i have no sentiment!  this is a movie stub from our first date! this is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed!  this is from the museum from the first time we were together. okay, maybe i exchange gifts sometimes, but i keep the things that matter! 
<ross> i dont know what to say, im sorry. though, youre not supposed to take these.  its like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.   
<monica>  ooh, this always happens.  
<s> here, let me help.  
<monica> thank you. 
<s> you-you have a very beautiful eye. 
<monica> yknow all my friends think this is weird. 
<s> yknow i-i thought it was gonna be weird, i mean i almost called and canceled, but it really isnt. 
<monica> i know! i mean its like me and your dad, thats a totally separate thing.

<phoebe> they were threefold. 
<s> oh. well uh,  you not being able to talk may make this easier. listen umm  listen i dont wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. i just, i cant stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and i dont wanna be the cause of that. so, i dont think we can see each other anymore. im gonna go to my moms in chicago, im gonna stay there for awhile. i think this couldve be something really amazing, but yknow this is probably for the best. yknow? im gonna miss you. good-bye, chandler.

<s> wait-wait-wait-wait! you can put your sad little muffin back in its drawer. if you must know the truth, i didnt want to lose a perfectly good assistant.

< 
<rachel> hey mon, little question for ya! how do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer? 
<monica> okay, the owner of allesandros came over to yell at me, but instead i made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!! 
<rachel> oh my god!! you just ruined the thing i was practicing the whole way home, but im soo happy! 
<monica> can you believe it? i finally get to run my own kitchen! 
<rachel> ohh, youve waited soo long. 
<phoebe>  hey! 
<rachel> hey, pheebs, quick question for ya. 
<phoebe> yeah. 
<rachel> how do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at bloomingdales? 
<phoebe> i dont know, it would totally depend on her coloring and  you got the job!! 
<rachel> yes!!! 
<monica> you got the job?! why didnt you tell me? 
<rachel> ohh, its gonna be so great! im gonna get to help decide what we sell, im gonna have an office with walls and everything.  im gonna have walls! 
<phoebe> okay, is this the day of good news or what? i got us a job! the wedding reception. 
<monica> ohh! umm, phoebe, i kinda need to talk to you about that.  umm, well i-i-i think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering. 
<phoebe> but weve only had one job. 
<monica> i know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like its snowballing, yknow? 
<phoebe> yeah! what are you saying? 
<monica> i got offered the head chef job at allesandros. 
<phoebe> what? 
<monica> its okay, cause y'know what? you dont really need me for the business. 
<phoebe> youre the cook! with out you its just me driving up to peoples houses with empty trays and asking for money! 
<monica> all right. but umm, i-i-ill pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van. 
<phoebe> for what? i cant believe this! i gotta get out of here.  
<monica> phoebe, wait a minute!  
<rachel> im an assistant buyer!! 
< 
<joey> all right, so well get a little coffee, and get energized, and well head back out. 
<chandler> yeah, all right. 
<ross> okay. 
<joey> so, were having fun, right? 
<joey> we dont need that wizard guy. we hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, well head down to the docks and see about that boat thing. 
<ross> im kinda beat. 
<chandler> actually, me too. 
<joey> are you serious?! 
<joey> thank god! im exhausted! 
<s> so you guys want coffees? 
<joey> yeah, but uh, i dont want to be up too late, so uh, ill have a decaf. 
<ross> yeah, me too. 
<chandler> actually, can i get some hot water with a little lemon? i think i strained my voice screaming in there. does it have to be so loud? 
<joey> i cant hear a word youre saying, my ears are ringing so bad. 
<ross> im just glad i brought that extra pair of socks, yknow? i used them as mittens, i didnt want to touch a thing in that last place.  
<ross> how sad are we? 
<joey> yeah, i know. 
<chandler> yknow what? were not sad, were not sad, were just not 21 anymore. yknow? im 29 years old, damnit! and i want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour! 
<joey> yeah! and i like to hang out in a quiet place where i can talk to my friends. 
<ross> and so what if i like to go home, throw on some kenny g, and take a bath! 
<joey> were 29, were not women. 
< 
<monica>  ohh, here you are. yknow, im-im glad you decided to hear me out. 
<phoebe> okay, im hearing. 
<monica> ive been doing a lot of thinking. a lot! and umm, well, i came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. okay umm, you could be flower delivery person. 
<phoebe> what?! 
<monica> or! a bakery delivery person. 
<phoebe> i wa-i wa-i wa 
<monica> pizza?! 
<phoebe> monica! 
<monica> all right, ive got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, im getting the feeling that you dont want to deliver. 
<phoebe> no. 
<monica> okay. im guessing that if you dont want to deliver, you probably dont want to pick stuff up either. 
<phoebe> no. 
<monica> yknow what, lets do the catering business. 
<phoebe> really?! are you sure? 
<monica> yeah, y'know i-i made a commitment to you. yknow what, itd be, itd be fun. 
<phoebe> oh! it will be fun! ohh! yay! oh! okay, ooh, lets plan the wedding reception.  wow! you really wanted me to do something with this van.  yknow what, i want you to take the chef job. 
<monica> really?! 
<phoebe> yeah. thats what you really want. yeah, i dont want to be the reason youre unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and i really dont want to be the reason im unhappy. 
<monica> thank you. 
<phoebe> besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new a-team.

<rachel> oh my god! oh, i cannot believe it! 
<rachel> oh, god. oh, god.  oh god. 
<rachel> yes, so close. mrs. lynch, i know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. but by any chance did joanna send any paperwork your way before it happened. seconds later. 
<rachel> yes-yes, just a few seconds and shed still be with usnothing about an assistant buyer? sophie arrives.) 
<s>  good morning! 
<rachel> oh, sophie, i guess you didnt hear about joanna 
<s> i sure did!  closing credits 
< 
<s> im so excited about having monica come on board with us. although i do feel bad about having fired chef emillio, its like losing a member of the family. of course, that literally is the case for several of you. tony, carlos, marie, please, tell your father how much were gonna miss him. now, i know that monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. so without much further ado, i present to you our new head chef.

<ross> im sorry im late, did i miss anything? 
<phoebe> joey stuffing 15 oreos in his mouth.  
<ross> 15?  your personal best!  
<phoebe> where were you? 
<ross> oh, on a date. yeah, i met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.  
<chandler> oh, yeah! how did you meet her? 
<phoebe> oh, which museum? 
<phoebe>  no, answer his. 
<ross> okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and i sat near the door, so shed have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. she was totally at my mercy. 
<chandler> were you so late because you were burring this woman? 
<ross> no, im getting back down cause she lives in poughkeepsie. she seems really great, but shes like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away. 
<chandler> how can she be great if shes from poughkeepsie?  that joke wouldve killed in albany. 
<joey> done! i did it! heh, whos stupid now?  opening credits 
< 
<chandler> hey, look at this!  theyre lighting the big christmas tree tonight. 
<phoebe> umm, that papers two weeks old. 
<chandler> all right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! i really wanted to take kathy to this, i cant believe i missed it. 
<rachel> hey, yknow, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! i hate being alone this time of year! next thing you know itll be valentines day, then my birthday, then bang!before you know it, theyre lighting that damn tree again. ohh, i want somebody!  yknow, i want a man!!  i mean, it doesnt even have to be a big relationship, yknow, just like a fling would be great. 
<chandler> really?! i didnt think girls ever just wanted a fling. 
<rachel> well, believe me, its been a long time since ive been flung. 
<joey> well, i know what im giving you for christmas. 
<chandler> yknow what? theres some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up? 
<rachel> yeah! wait a minute, its been a long time that ive been single. how come you never offered this before? 
<chandler> well, i have a girlfriend, im-im happy. so, i no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy. 
<rachel> okay! no accountants. oh, and no one from like legal. i dont like guys with boring jobs. 
<chandler> oh and ross was like what? a lion tamer?  
<s> hey! 
<phoebe> whats wrong mon? 
<monica> ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me. 
<phoebe> oh. 
<monica> i thought i was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, i get off work and i find out that they wrote this  on my chefs hat.  
<phoebe> hey, maybe they meant to write, quiet, bitch. 
<rachel> hey, honey! whats the matter?  fine, i was just trying to be nice! whoa! 
<monica> i mean i have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.  
<joey> ohhh! 
<monica> i mean theyre trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, i would. but this is something ive been waiting for my whole life. 
<rachel> well, wait a minute, youre the boss! why dont you just yell at them? or, fire them? 
<monica> i would love too, but i cant! i mean i just cant, you know that im not good at confrontation. 
<chandler> hey, you know what you can do? i remember reading about this director, i think it was orson wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. then they would all know, whos boss. 
<joey> hey, mon! im not doing anything, why dont you fire me? 
<monica> thats a good idea! wait, do you know how to waiter? 
<joey> good enough to get fired. 
<monica> all right, youre hired! 
<joey> hey! that must be why i got fired last week! does this orson wells guy direct burger king commercials? 
<chandler>  yes. 
< 
<chandler> i say, drew! are you seeing anybody right now?  og-ee-op, im not asking for me, im i mean no, im-im not gay, im not asking you out. im not-im not-im not gay! 
<s> i didnt think you were gay. i do now. 
<chandler> see my friend-my friend, rachel, she wants to be set up. 
<s> ahh, i just got out of a big relationship, im not looking for any thing serious. 
<chandler> oh, yknow what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with rachel. 
<s> whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! is this, hot rachel, that you took to the christmas party, rachel? 
<chandler>  oh, by the way, that is her full name. 
<s> oh wow! im free for her! 
<s> oh, wait a second! i didnt say i wasnt free! 
<s> hey, chandler, why dont we talk this over at the ranger game tomorrow? 
<s> hold on, yknow i just got a box of cubans, maybe i bring them by your office around uh, five? 
<chandler> oh well, thats uh, a little later than i uh, generally care to stay, but sure! 
<s> maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch basel hadens. 
<chandler> well, i dont really know what that is, but lets!!

<joey> what are you talking about? lots of things rhyme with rachel. bagel. mail. jail. bail. able. may-pole. 
<phoebe> all good, thanks.  do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname thats easier to rhyme? 
<monica> didnt your dad used to call you pumpkin?

<chandler> yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards. 
<rachel> op, i like credit cards! 
<chandler> see, im not bad at this fixing up thing, huh? 
<rachel> well, so what does he do?

<chandler> its a big company, i dontif youi 
<joey> now, wait a second! you make food and robots? 
<phoebe> no! no, the robots just work for them.

<ross> oh, wow! i should get going. i-i got a date tonight. 
<chandler> oh yeah! with who? 
<ross> you know that girl i told you about who lives up in poughkeepsie? 
<chandler> yeah. 
<ross> not her. yeah, this is someone else i meet, and i-i cant decide between the two of them. yknow the one from poughkeepsie, even though shes a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. but this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. yknow shes, well shes-shes just as pretty, i guess shes smart, shes not fun. 
<phoebe> if shes no fun, why do you want to date her at all? 
<ross> well, i-i want to give her another chance, yknow? she lives so close. and, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that wasif she was kidding was very funny. on the other hand, if she wasnt kidding, shes not fun, shes stupid, and kind of a racist. 
<joey>  hey! 
<ross> hey! 
<chandler> hey, man! 
<phoebe> hey! ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant? 
<joey>  damn!

<monica> thanks.  i think you got it! 
< 
<rachel>  chandler!! you have the best taste in men! 
<chandler> well, like father, like son. 
<rachel> patrick and i had such a great time last night! i mean i think this could maybe turn into something serious. 
<chandler> really?! i-i thought you werent looking for something serious? i thought you were looking for some kind of a fling. 
<rachel> well, y'know, possibly.  you didnt tell him that, though? right? 
<chandler> ummmmmmmm, no. 
<rachel> you told this guy that i was looking for a fling?! you dont tell the guy that! 
<chandler> why not?! id be thrilled if i heard that some hot girl was just looking to getoh i see. 
<rachel> oh, between you telling him that i wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first dateoh, hes so gonna get the wrong idea. 
< 
<monica> hey, joey, could you pass the cheese? 
<joey> yeah. listen uh, id prefer it if you didnt call me joey. since i dont know anyone here, i thought itd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.  
<joey>  theres like-theres like 300 bucks in this one! hurts to wear tight trousers. 
<monica> okay. could the waiters gather around to hear tonights specials? okay, first there is a chilean sea bass prepared with a mango relish on a bagwhy is nobody writing these down? 
<monica> because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night? 
<monica> okay, forget the specials for a minute. umm, all right heres the thing, for the last two weeks i have umm,  tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere 
<monica>  a positive atmosphere! but i-i-i have had it up to here.  from now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! all right? does anybody have a problem with that?!!  hey new guy! i said, does anybody have a problem with that?! 
<joey> no maam. check your hat.  we did the hat right?  commercial break 
< 
<monica> what the hell happened?! 
<joey> i am so-so-so sorry. i was gonna do it! really! but i was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and i was thinking, "wow! its been a long time since i had  327 + 238 dollars!" 
<monica> joey, we had a deal. that-thats why youre here! ive got to fire you! 
<joey> and i gotta pay rent! look, how-how about this? you dont fire me, instead i stay here, i gain their trust, and theyll start listening to all the nice things ive been saying about you. 
<monica> what kinda things have you been saying? 
<joey> well nothing yet, they really hate you and i want to fit in. 
< 
<phoebe>  happy, happy chanukah, chandler and monica. very merry

<phoebe> well look, you dont really like the one from uptown and youre too exhausted from dating the one up in poughkeepsie, so i say you just end them both. okay? you take a train up to poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. and then by the time you get home tonight, youre done!

<s> uhh, yeah. 
<s> weve been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got engaged, we thought wed get a jump on things, yknow no ones getting any younger. 
<s> see the thing is umm, were not able to yknow, uh, conceive. 
<s> and weve tried everything, weve seen a bunch of doctors. 
<s> yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. so we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into. 
<phoebe>  thats a really nice gift. i was thinking of like a gravy boat. opening credits

<chandler> so what job did you get joe? 
<joey> oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. yeah, ross got it for me. 
<rachel> well, how can you be a tour guide, dont you have to be a dinosaur expert or something? 
<joey> no, not really. they give you all the information, its uh, its like memorizing a script.  "and on your left, you have tyrannosaurus rex, a carnivore from the jurassic period. 
<ross> uh actually joey, its the cretasous period. 
<joey> yeah but, i can pronounce jurassic. 
<phoebe>  hey!!

<phoebe> ewww! and "oh no!" itsthey just want me to be the surrogate. its her-its her egg and her sperm, and im-im just the oven, its totally their bun. 
<joey> huh. 
<monica> what did you tell them? 
<phoebe> well, they said that i had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? im gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give. 
<chandler> youre gonna be carrying their baby and give them a sony play station? 
<rachel> honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about. 
<monica> yeah, like youre gonna be pregnant. i mean pregnant. 
<phoebe> i know! 
<ross> pheebs, youre talking about putting your body through an awful lot, i mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and its all for somebody else! 
<phoebe> yeah, whats your point? 
<ross> well, the stuff i just mentioned. 
<rachel> wow! i dont know if i could ever do that. i always figured the first time i had a baby was with somebody i love and that baby would be a keeper. 
<phoebe> y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when i wanted to make denim furniture. 
<joey> no, pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, well be supportive like crazy. 
<s> yeah. 
<monica> we just want you to think it through. 
<rachel> yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody whos had a baby. like your mom? 
<phoebe> my mom never gave birth. oh! but my birth mom did. 
< 
<s> umm,  i love this touchy. can i take it to work with me? 
<chandler> oh, yeah, sure, its not mine anyway. it can with the pants. 
<s> oh!  
<monica> i am so jealous. 
<rachel> you guys are really right there arent you? 
<chandler> yes. right where? 
<monica> in the beginning where yknow its all sex and talking and sex and talking and 
<chandler> yeah, you-you gotta love the talking. 
<monica> and the sex? 
<chandler> all right, we havent had sex yet. okay, whats the big deal? yknow? this is special, and i want our love to grow until we move on to the next level. 
<rachel> oh, chandler that is so nice. 
<ross> that is really nice lying! no way is that the reason! 
<rachel> why? just because youre not mature enough to understand something like that?! 
<chandler> no, hes right, im totally lying.  
<monica> then what is it? 
<chandler> well, kathys last boyfriend was joey. 
<ross> and youre afraid you wont be able to fill his shoes. 
<chandler> no, im afraid i wont be able to make love as well as him. 
<ross> yeah, i was going for the metaphor. 
<chandler> yes, and i was saying the actual words. 
<monica> so big deal, so joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt mean hes great in bed. 
<chandler> we share a wall! so either hes great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot. 
<monica> sweetie, with you its gonna be different. the sex is gonna be great, cause you-you guys are in love. 
<chandler> yeah? 
<rachel> yeah! 
<ross> just go for it chandler. 
<monica> yeah, you should. 
<rachel> yeah, you should, really. 
<monica> go on. 
<chandler> all right, all right, ill go sleep with my girlfriend. but im just doing it for you guys. 
< 
<joey> okay, now the mastodon is from the semi-late jurassic period.

<phoebe> wow! you really go all out when youre expecting company. 
<phoebe> oh! ooh! oh, i didnt know that you did pot. erotica. 
<phoebe> ooh, erotiery! thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. yknow 
<phoebe> okay. 
<phoebe> why not? donti dont know if theres anything i can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby. so, umm,  
<phoebe> oh no! no-no! i understand the pain! dont-dont hurt the puppy. 
<phoebe> oh, i get a puppy!! 
<phoebe> why? and everything now, but umm,  uhh phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, its very important. 
<phoebe> okay. i only wish i had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. i just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. so, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child.  i really shouldnt have given you the puppy first. 
<phoebe> all right, im sorry. 
< 
<joey> uhh, do you mind sitting there. im-im saving this for my friend ross. 
<joey> doctor? wow! i didnt know he had a nickname. over there,  and only the people in the blue blazers sit here. 
<joey> well, how-how come? 
<joey> thats crazy. and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. see that scientist in the classes, he and i used to play together all the time in grade school, but now  peter! hey, peter! its me rhonda! from ps-129! i shared my puddin which you man! i gave you my snack pack!  see, he pretend he dont even here me! 
<joey> i-i think everybodys pretending they dont hear you. anyway, look, i dont know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but ross is one of my best friends, and if i save him a seat, im telling you, he will sit in it!  ross! ross! over here, man! i-i saved you seat. 
<ross> thats okay, im cool over here. ill catch up with you later, joey.   commercial break 
< 
<ross>  hey, uh, im really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today. 
<joey> its no big deal. hey, yknow, you do what you gotta do. right? 
<ross> but hey, its not just me, i mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together. 
<joey> whatever. 
<ross> its like that everywhere, joey! okay, mon, back me up here. where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? and the chefs eat with the other chefs, right? 
<monica> i eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me. 
<joey> look, ross, really its-its no big deal. yknow you wear a white coat, i wear a blue blazer, if that means we cant be friends at work, then so be it. yknow, hey i understand. yknow? hey, when im in a play and youre in the audience, i dont talk to you, right? so its yknow, its uh, its cool. ill see you tomorrow.

<monica> what?! 
<phoebe> umm, the street. come on, lets go to the street. ooh, listen, dont go onto the balcony until after i get back.  
<monica>  so, did you do it? 
<chandler> yes, yes, we had the sex. 
<monica> uh-oh, it was bad? 
<chandler> it was fine, yknow? but she didnt agree with me as strongly as she agreed with joey. she was more like, "i see you point, im all right with it." 
<monica> well, it was the first time. yknow, theres not always a lot of agreement the first time. 
<rachel> yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree  like that. 
<chandler> look, you have to help me! okay? i mean, i know what to do with a woman, yknow, i know where everything goes, its always nice. but i need to know what makes it go from nice to, "my god! somebodys killing her in there!" 
<monica> all right, im gonna show you something a lot of guys dont know. rach, give me that pad, please?  all right. now 
<chandler> look, you dont have to draw an actual wowhoa! shes hot!

<chandler>  there are seven?! 
<rachel> let me see that.  oh, yeah.

<monica> its kind of an important one! 
<chandler> oh, yknow-yknow what, i was looking at it upside down. 
<rachel> well, yknow, sometimes that helps.  
<monica>  now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp. 
<chandler> that-thats bad? 
<rachel> well if you go to disneyland, you dont spend the whole day on the materhorn. 
<chandler> well you might if it were anything like 7! 
<monica> all right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit em all, and you mix em up. you gotta keep them on their toes. 
<rachel> oo, toes!! well, for some people.  
<monica> all right. umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4,  2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, 7.. 7 7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7 !

< 
<chandler> okay, she is the star of the play. and she is my girlfriend! i get to have sex with the star of the play! 
<ross> people can hear you. 
<chandler> i know!!  
<chandler> wow! she looks great. doesnt she?

<ross> dude! 
<s> if you want it to be.  
<ross> heres your girlfriends button.  opening credits 
< 
<phoebe> oh, hey, mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school? 
<monica> yeah, i think i have some around here somewhere. why? 
<phoebe> well, its just that maternity clothes are so expensive.  
<monica> hey, rach! i made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. if you could just  throw your purses at it. 
<rachel> bloomingdales eliminated my department.  
<monica> oh my god, are you out of a job? 
<rachel> no, but they stuck me in personal shopping. which is just a huge step down! 
<phoebe> personal shopping? what is that? like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy? 
<rachel> uh-huh. 
<phoebe> that sounds great! 
<joey>  hey!  
<monica> umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. you cant eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended. 
<joey>  theres gravy? 
<monica> if you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. that fridge has got to be stocked, okay, thats your department now.   
<monica> what are you doing? 
<joey> i think i left a donut up here. 
< 
<ross> hey! 
<phoebe> hey! 
<joey> hey! 
<phoebe> ooh! how was kathys play? 
<ross> well, kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin guy. 
<chandler> yeah, its like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it! 
<phoebe> thats a good idea for a business! 
<chandler> im totally screwed. okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then theyre gonna go to their cast parties and hes gonna try to undermine me. y'know itll be like, "so wheres your boyfriend, whats-his-name, chester?" and shell go, "no-no-no, its chandler." and hell go, "whatever. ha-ha-ha-ha!" 
<joey>  that-that is a good trick. 
<chandler> all right, look, look, what am i gonna do? 
<joey> chandler, look theyre actors. theyre there to do a job, just cause they work together, doesnt mean theyre gonna get together. i mean just cause it happened with susan sarandon and tim robbins, it doesnt mean its gonna happen with them. 
<ross> oh-oh, alec baldwin and kim basinger. 
<joey> tom cruise and nicole kidman. 
<ross> yeah. 
<phoebe> hey, mel gibson and clint eastwood. 
<ross> theyre not a couple! 
<phoebe> oh-okay, i get the game now. 
<joey> okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot? 
<ross> oh yeah! 
<joey> well okay, so then youre fine. the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. okay? so as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble. 
<chandler> really? 
<joey> look, you guys have been to every play ive ever been in, have i ever had chemistry on stage? 
<ross> no. 
<joey> noooo!! 
< 
<chandler> so uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight? 
<ross> yknow what, i dont know how comfortable i am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend. 
<chandler> yeah, i know but 
<ross> oh no-no-no, im there. 
<monica>  hey! 
<joey> hey mon! want some pancakes? 
<monica> you made pancakes? 
<joey> yep! grab a plate. 
<monica> okay.  
<joey> no-no, stay right there.  gettin closer. 
<chandler> okay, okay, but dont worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. which im fairly certain are the same thing. 
<joey> listen also were uh, were watching the game here saturday night, if people want to come over. 
<ross> oh yeah! 
<monica> oh, i was thinking about having people over for the game. 
<joey> oh yeah, whos playing? 
<monica> the players. 
<ross> somebody seems to be missing being the hostess. 
<monica>  please, its a relief is what it is, is what it is. 
<joey> all right pheebs, stick out your plate! 
<phoebe> oh.  
< 
<rachel>  monica, im quitting! i just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didnt even buy it!  im telling you im quitting! thats it! im talking to my boss right now!  yes i am!  yes i am! yes i am! yes i am! yes i am! yes i am! okay bye, call me when you get this message.  oh! mr. waltham, i ah really need to talk to you. a customer.

<rachel> oh-oh, sorry, its this way, its this way.  
<s> its this way? sorry.  
< 
<chandler> im right! right? there was like no chemistry between them. before they had heat, and now theres no heat! now you know what this means, joey told us what this means! 
<ross> all right, lets not jump to any conclusions. all right? there was some sexual chemistry between them. 
<chandler> come on, it was like cousins having sex up there! 
<ross> here she comes. dont say a word, okay? just be cool, dont be y'know you. 
<s> hey you guys!

<ross> okay, i  
<s> clearly, im having sex with him? 
<chandler> oh come on, it was so obvious! there was no chemistry between you two! 
<s> okay, so let me just get this straight. youre accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance? 
<chandler> yknow, i-i could see how this could happen, y'know youre up there every night, youre naked, touching, kissing. 
<s> acting! chandler, this is my job! im-im playing a part in a play! how can you not trust me?! 
<chandler> well, you can understand, given how we started. 
<s> oh, wow. i cant believe youre throwing that in my face. 
<chandler> well, that is what happened, and i dont even see you denying this! 
<s> ill tell you what, chandler, why dont you call me when you grow up!

<phoebe> if you wanted to punish them, you shouldve just made them hang out here! 
<rachel> yeah, thats true.

<rachel> really? it doesnt seem desperate? 
<joey> oh-ooh, thats the turn-on. 
<phoebe> he just got a divorce right?

<phoebe> how? how is your fault? 
<chandler> because, i-i shouldve called! yknow if i had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never wouldve gone out with nick, and they wouldve ended up in bed together. i threw her at his man nipples! 
<rachel> honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.

<phoebe> ohh! so, did you get to meet her? 
<rachel> no, there is no rachel greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "im rachel greep! im rachel greep!" and he let her right in. 
<monica> so you hit her in the face? 
<rachel> no, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so i clocked her. ohhh! i cant believe this, all i wanted was a few hours outside of work to see joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me. 
<phoebe>  aww, pheebs. 
<rachel> honey, thats youre name.

<s> oh boy, i just love to sing! 
<chandler> yes, i-i know that you do, but i think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing old man river.

<rachel>  hey! 
<joey> hey! whats up? 
<monica> this switch thing has been driving me crazy. so i turned it off and checked every outlet. now, four of them dont work. which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. so, i plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when i turn it on i just follow the noise and find out which one it is. 
<joey>  i bet i stopped listening before you did. 
<rachel> yknow, you-you also couldve used uh, lamps and then followed the light. 
<monica> yeah, well, im using noise. okay. all right! so, is everybody ready? here we go.  i hear something! i hear something! where is it?

<joey> ohhhh, good one! and yemen that actually sounds like a real country. 
<s>  chandler! come on, im gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. its a real space saver. 
<phoebe> yeah, i know, i do that cause it makes me look taller.

<chandler> maybe thats because soy-burgers suck! 
<phoebe> being pregnant is tough on your tummy. 
<joey> hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow. 
<phoebe> thats sweat. you throw up all morning, youll have that glow too.

<rachel> huh. well, uh, thats uh, thats interesting.  
<s>  hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that? 
<rachel> oh, its just an anti-theft device. 
<s> then uh, whats-whats this?  
<rachel> you need that, you need that too cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.  
< 
<rachel> oops, sorry. listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans. 
<chandler> what are you talking about? 
<joey> yeah, what going on? 
<rachel> we have to have a surprise bon voyage party for emily. but its actually for joshua.  look, he said hes not ready to date, so i had to invite him to a party if i wanted to see him outside of work, and now i have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!  
<ross> well, as much as id like to meet josh and warn him, emily and i arent going to be here. all right? i mean, shes going to come by first to say good-bye, and then ive got a whole special evening planned. so im sorry, no party. 
<joey> awwww! 
<s>  hello? 
<rachel> surprise!!! 
<s> no ones ever thrown me a surprise party before! 
<rachel> well, it was all rosss idea. 
<s> youre so sweet! and im so surprised! 
<ross> you really didnt know?

<chandler> like what?  
<joey> what-what-what is so funny?

<s> oh, no thanks. 
<rachel> no? yknow, i can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.  
<s> you okay?  you all right?  
<ross>  so we should probably get going soon. 
<s> oh, but the partys only just getting started! 
<ross> yeah, but we-we have to be at the four seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then yknow, then the plaza for dinner. 
<s> so why did you plan a party at the same time? 
<ross> no-no-no, no, umm, actually american surprise parties are-are-are very short. its usually, "surprise!" and then, "oh my god, im so surprisedgood-bye!" 
<s> but ross, im such having a great time! your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties.

<chandler> she was a welder. 
<joey> what? were you like in the movie, or anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. very sexy, and classy. 
<monica> or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe. 
<rachel> its not christmas! 
<monica> or spin the bottle? 
<rachel> hes not 11! 
<s>  thank you so much for this. it was really so thoughtful of you. 
<rachel> what? youre leaving?!

<joey> hey, what if i said, i could even things out for ya, meatwise. 
<phoebe> what? 
<joey> well, i eat a lot of meat right? 
<phoebe> yeah. 
<joey> well, suppose until the babys born i laid off it. no extra animals would die, you-youd just be eating my animals. 
<phoebe> joey, i cant believe you would do that for me. 
<joey> absolutely! i could be a vegetarian. theres no meat in beer, right?  
<ross> okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.  
<s> but, we cant go now. it looks like rachels gonna put on a skit. 
<monica> oh my god! have you lost your mind?

<phoebe> no, back to happy. back to happy!

<rachel> yknow who doesnt even like dirty movies? my new boyfriend joshua. 
<joey> yeah right. 
<rachel> no, he told me. he prefers to leave certain things to the imagination. 
<chandler> oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?

<monica> where ya going? 
<rachel> im going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny.  hey, pheebs!

<joey> hey! 
<monica> how did it go with frank and alice? 
<phoebe> well, frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! i need to make a lot of money really fast, and i had an idea that i want to talk to you  about, cause you work for a big company. okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me. 
<chandler> they dont really talk to us about that kind of stuff. i can get you some free white out though.  
<monica> ohh! did you do what i said? did-did-did you tell her? 
<ross> i did. 
<monica> and well, what did she say? 
<ross> thank you. 
<monica> oh, youre totally welcome! whatd she say? 
<ross> she said, "thank you." i said, "i love you." and she said, "thank you." 
<chandler> whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her? 
<joey> yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?! 
<ross> what do i do now? 
<joey> you play hard to get. 
<ross> she already lives in london. 
<joey> then you go to tokyo. 
<chandler> all right look, forget it, forget it. you told her you love her, its over. 
<monica> it is not over! youre over! 
<chandler> what? 
<monica> you know! 
<chandler> okay.  good one. 
<monica> it is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. and the reason why she couldnt, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! come on now go! go!  
<ross> okay! okay! but if she doesnt call, it is definitely over! no, wait. wait. unless, eventually, i call her, yknow just to she whats going on, and, and she says shell call me back, but then she doesnt. then its over.  
<joey> way to be strong, man!  
< 
<rachel> hey! 
<chandler> hi! listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? we need a porn break. we spent the last two hours watching in & out & in, again. 
<rachel> well, so, why dont you just turn it off? 
<chandler> because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn. 
<phoebe>  ooh, good, youre hear! okay. 
<monica> hey! 
<phoebe> hi! 
<rachel> well, what-what cha got there? 
<phoebe> oh this, well im glad you asked.  now, dont you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?  ahh! now, i know what youre thinking 
<chandler> pregnant woman slays four? 
<monica> phoebe, they didnt make you pay for those knives, did they? 
<phoebe> no! 
<monica> are you sure? 
<phoebe> no! 
<rachel> honey, youre not gonna make enough money to help frank and alice just by selling knives. 
<phoebe> no-no, i know that, but i just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan. 
<chandler> whats the second part of your plan? 
<phoebe> my saturn dealership. 
< 
<ross>  hello?

<s> ross umm, theres something that ive got to tell you, theres-theres someone else. 
<ross> does that mean the same thing in england as it does in america? 
< 
<ross> she doesnt know which one of us she wants, me or this colin guy. 
<monica> this isnt how its supposed to go, there cant be another guy. 
<ross> well 
<monica> of course theres another guy!! this is even more perfect! now you have to prove your love! 
<ross> im not proving anything. okay, im done listening to you. if i hadnt let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, i never wouldve put my fist through the wall! 
<chandler> you put your fist through the wall? 
<ross> no, i missed and hit the door. but, it opened really hard! 
<monica> you have to go to london! 
<ross> what? 
<monica> yeah, you have to go fight for her! 
<joey> oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. yeah. cause you already told her you love her and she didnt say it back, then she called you and told you that theres another guy, so yeah, go to london thatll scare her! 
<monica> when rachel was with paulo, what did you do? 
<ross> i made fun of his accent. 
<monica> you sat back and let him have her, you didnt fight at all. am i right? do you want the same thing to happen with emily? 
<ross> no. 
<monica> all right then, go fight for her! go to london! i mean, that could be you and emily!  that, but-but nicer. just, go to london! 
<ross> really? 
<monica> come on! surprise her! show up at her doorstep! dont let her go without a fight! 
<ross> all right. all right, im gonna do it!

<monica> thats sounds great, but how are you going to afford it? 
<rachel> well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised 
<phoebe> im telling it! im telling it! 
<rachel> okay. 
<phoebe> okay. you know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so i just figured we could combine the two, okay, i give the massages and frank drives! i can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what ive got? 
<chandler> a place where no one will ever get out alive? 
<phoebe> no! think about it, its a taxi that people take when they need to relax, its 
<rachel>  relaxi-taxi! 
<phoebe> the name was my favourite part! 
<rachel> well, well i can up with it! 
<phoebe> you did not!!!! oh! no! you came up with relaxi cab! thats not good. 
<rachel> well, i

<monica> all right. when is, when is the next flight out? 
<ross> about four hours. 
<monica> okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesnt show up by then, then just come on home. 
<phoebe> hey, tell him about relaxi-taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks thats better than relaxi cab. 
<rachel> okay, its not relaxi cab. its relaxicab, like taxicab. 
<phoebe> oh, that is better.

<chandler> yes it is! from now on, i have no first name. 
<joey> so, youre just bing? 
<chandler> i have no name. 
<phoebe> all right, so, what are we supposed to call you?

<monica> emilys straight. 
<ross> oh, wake up! 
<phoebe> wow, carol really messed you up! 
<ross> excuse me? 
<phoebe> yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant.  all right, so i dont know what sycophant means, but the rest is right. 
<ross> look, i dont know what youre talking about, i am not a crazy, jealous person. 
<rachel> huh. 
<ross> what? 
<rachel> shes totally right! when we were together, you got all freaked out about mark and there was nothing going on. 
<monica> this totally makes sense! 
<ross> it does not! 
<monica> oh, sure it does! in high school, you werent jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you! 
<phoebe> all right, all right, so up until 92-93 he was very trusting, then 94 hit, carol left him and bamn! paranoid city! 
<rachel> absolutely! absolutely! 
<monica> this is so much fun! 
<ross> this is not fun! 
<monica> look, all were trying to say is, dont let what happened with carol ruin what you got with emily. 
<phoebe> yeah. the 92 ross wouldnt. 
<ross> well, i still think i was right about that whole mark thing. 
<rachel> whatyeahwhat, yknow what? i hope emily is a lesbian. 
< 
<phoebe> drum roll. 
<chandler>  okay. okay. all right. help! am i a mark, or a john?

<chandler> all right look, am i serious, okay? tomorrow at i am going down to the courthouse. 
<phoebe> youre actually going through with this? 
<chandler> hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. okay, its probably why kids picked on me in school, and why i never do well with women so, as of 4 oclock tomorrow, im either gonna be mark johnson or john markson. 
<phoebe> you got problems because of you! not your name! all right, this has got to stop! chandler is a great name! in factyes,  im, im sorry. i know you really wanted me to name the baby joey, but eh, so, im-im, im gonna, im gonna name the baby chandler.

<phoebe> anyway, i just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.  
<monica> wow, you seem to be doing so much better. thats great. so how-how are things going? 
<phoebe> good. yknowno-no, okay, its-it feels like everythings been about me lately, so whats happening with you? 
<rachel> oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to rosss wedding. 
<phoebe> oh! 
<rachel> it just might be too hard, given the history and all that 
<phoebe> wow! this reminds me of the time when i was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if i slept with him. 
<rachel> well, h-how is this like that? 
<phoebe> well, lets see, its not. really, like that. because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like yknow a bunch of yknow high school crap that nobody really gives yknow 
<rachel>  im-im sorry, i just thought that 
<phoebe> alrighty, here come the water works.  
< 
<joey> ugh! i dont know what im going to do! i called the company that sent and th-they dont care! then i called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isnt an emergency, then what is? 
<ross>  hey guys! 
<chandler> hey! 
<joey> hey 
<ross> i just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! and the guys from work had a blast. yknow, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. yeah! and-and another one had never been to a party before, so 
<joey> so uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? man, thats nice! 
<ross> yeah, right! 
<joey> i was uh, i was thinking i might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, i might want to get one of those 
<ross> that ring? when my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her. 
<chandler> so you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?  
<ross> oh absolutely! it has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life. 
<chandler> so you might say, its a magic ring. 
<joey>  yeah, the stripper stole it. 
<ross> my-my ring? my-my wedding ring? the-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! h-how?! how could this all happen?! 
<chandler> well, i think it all started when you said, "hey joey, why dont you be my best man." 
<ross>  all right-all right, fine! i-im gonna call the cops! 
<joey> dude, i screwed up, you dont have to turn me in! 
<ross> not on you! on the stripper! 
<joey> oh, yeah, well i already did that! they said theyre gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders. 
<ross> okay, well, well call the company that sent her! 
<joey> i did that too! they wouldnt give me her real name or her number. they said, "if i bothered them again theyd call the police." i said, "if you talk to the police, you tell them im missing a ring!" 
<ross> so what, joey? wh-wh-what? what are you telling me? that theres nothing we can do? well, how could this happen?! 
<joey> look ross, i am so-so sorry. i-i-i 
<chandler> well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office? 
<joey> oh, that sounds like fun, but weve got a ring to find!! 
< 
<monica> heres your tea phoebe.  
<phoebe>  its so good.  oh, thanks. 
<rachel> good. 
<monica> im so glad you liked it. 
<phoebe>  oh!  
<monica> what?! 
<rachel> what?! she made the tea!  
<phoebe> oh! no, i-i think i just had a contraction. 
<rachel> you what? 
<monica> oh my god! 
<phoebe> yeah, i thought i had one a couple of minutes ago, and now i know that was definitely one. 
<monica> wait, you cant have the baby here! i mean i havent sterilised it since the guys moved out! 
<rachel> okay. its okay. were gonna be okay. yknow what? its okay. im gonna, im gonna, im gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets! 
<phoebe> no. its all right; its probably false labour. they said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book. 
<monica> rachel, get the book! the book! 
<rachel> okay!  okay! here! 
<monica> the bible?! 
<rachel> i dont know! 
< 
<joey> all right, okay, this is great, uh, chandler, you get behind the desk. and-and when she comes in hopefully, she wont recognise you because, well, why would she? uh, okay, and then you buzz ross and i.  you be mr. gonzalez, and ill be uh, mr. wong. 
<ross> diverse.  
<chandler>  you be cool.  hey, joey? 
<ross> wheres my ring? my dead grandmothers wedding ring? where is it? where is it? 
<chandler> way to be cool, man.

<s> yeah! 
<ross> we know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess! steal some stupid ring, all right? i make $1,600 a week doing what i do; any of you guys make that? 
<chandler> marry me.  
< 
<joey> i dont get it! it was in my room all night! and if she didnt take it, and i didnt take it; and you  didnt take it, then who did?  shh! were trying to think!  
< 
<rachel> i still dont get how you know when its false labour. 
<phoebe> well, do you see any babies? 
<monica> how do you feel? 
<phoebe> okay, i guess. i mean i dont know, its just, i guess i know its going to be over soon. 
<rachel> well, isnt that a good thing? you said you were sick of this. 
<phoebe> i know. its just yknow usually when youre, when youre done with the pregnant thing, yknow, then you get to do the mom thing. im gonna be yknow, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking tequila. 
<monica> some moms do that. 
<phoebe> okay thats even sadder. look, i know, i know what i got myself into, its just that now that theyre in me its like, its like i know them yknow, i mean-i mean, its just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away. 
<monica> aww, sweetie, but its not like youre not gonna have anything. youre gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways thats even better. 
<phoebe> yeah, okay. 
<rachel> no, really. really, pheebs, youre not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when theyre bad, yknow, or deciding to put them on ritalin when they just wont calm down. yknow? 
<monica> i mean, youre the one theyre gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex. 
<rachel> and you just get to be cool aunt phoebe!

<ross> yeah. yeah. yes, this place is beautiful. emilys parents got married here. 
<s> i still cant believe theyre tearing it down. it really is the most lovely building youll ever see. i mean its over  oh my god!

<phoebe> yeah, i do. whats the matter? 
<rachel> im just bummed about the way i left things with ross. i shouldnt have lied to him about having to work. he seemed so mad at me. 
<phoebe> eh, dont be so hard on yourself. if someone i was still in love with was getting married

<phoebe> yeah! 
<rachel> im not in love with ross!

<phoebe> oh no, ross doesnt know anything. 
<rachel> oh, i can not believe you didnt tell me! 
<phoebe> well, because we thought you knew!! its so obvious! god, that would be like telling monica, "hey, you like things clean." 
< 
<joey> hey! tulip post cards... 
<joey> check this out? huh?  yeah. thats the stuff. what do you think? 
<chandler> well, i dont have to buy that, "im with stupid" t-shirt anymore. 
<joey> well, i like it. here you go.  
<chandler> all right, look, youre not really gonna buy that are you? dont you think youve embarrassed me enough for one day? 
<joey> oh, i embarrass you? 
<chandler> how can i answer that when im pretending i dont know you? them! 
<chandler> oh really? then how come no one here is wearing them? 
<chandler> all right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, yknow, youre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself. 
<joey> oh yeah?  if youre gonna make me choose between you and the hat? i choose the hat.

<s> hello? 
<ross> hey! i just spoke to your dad, and you know what? he seems to think well be able to find a new place for the wedding. 
<s> we dont have to. 
<ross> whoa-whoa-what? you found a place? 
<s> no. but, monica and i were talking, and-and i was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit. 
<ross> she said what? 
<s> she said, "if im not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it." 
<ross> postpone it? emily, do you think monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? do you my sisters teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?  this isnt right. 
<s> i realize that people are going to be disappointed. but, im sure theyll come back when we can do it right. 
<ross> i cant ask people to do that? would you ask people to do that?  
<s> dont you point your pants at me!  we have no choice! anywhere thats half-decent wouldve be booked months ago, ross dont you understand? this is our wedding im talking about. 
<ross> the only thing i understand is; postponing it is not an option. this is when were getting married. 
<s> so what are you saying? its now or never? 
<ross> no. im saying its now.  
<s> or? 
<ross> theres no or in mind. what is wrong with these pants?!! 
<s> its not the pants. its you that is backwards. and if, and if you dont understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldnt get married at all!  
<ross>  no, wait! emily! no, wait, stop! emily, please commercial break 
< 
<phoebe> hey! 
<rachel>  hi. 
<phoebe> so, did shopping make you feel any better about ross?

<rachel> you can? 
<phoebe> yeah. i just need you to bring me some photos of ross. 
<rachel> um-hmm. 
<phoebe> and a small piece of chocolate. 
<rachel> okay. 
<phoebe> and a glass of tepid water.  
<rachel> ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree? 
<phoebe> uh, only if you have the hiccups too. yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. i just didnt feel like getting up. okay, im gonna show you a picture of ross. okay? and youre going to remember all of the bad things about him. all right? really focus on his flaws. 
<rachel> i can do that. i certainly did it when we were going out. 
<phoebe> okay. umm, before we get started, i just wanna say for the record that i love ross, i think hes such a great guy. here.  okay, now, close your eyes. and imagine that youre with ross okay and imagine that youre kissing him. and youre-youre running your hands all over his body. and then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross its some kind of grease, itsuck! hah? 
<rachel> i dont know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and yknow it was always more crunchy than it was greasy. 
<phoebe> okay, this is going to be harder than i thought. umm, lets try some uh, aversion therapy. 
<rachel> okay. 
<phoebe> okay? 
<rachel> all right. 
<phoebe> so uh, now look at the picture 
<rachel> okay.

<chandler> hey.  
<joey> oh.  sorry! 
<chandler> no-no-no, yknow what? i really shouldnt have said that you were embarrassing me, i mean that really wasnt cool. and if it makes you feel any better, ive had a really lousy day.

<monica> hey!

<monica>  yes, i did! and you are welcome! 
<ross> am i?! and was it your idea to postpone the wedding?! 
<monica> umm 
<chandler> im gonna go to the bathroom. 
<joey> wait up!  
<ross> hey-hey, since youre the fix-it lady, heres a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesnt want to have the wedding at all? 
<monica> she said that?! 
<ross> yeah. 
<monica> why?! 
<ross> i dont know, i told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out. 
<monica> oh my god. youre even dumber than i am! 
<ross> excuse me? 
<monica> ross, how long have you been planning this wedding? 
<ross> i dont know. a month? 
<monica> emily has probably been planning it since she was five! ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. thats what we did! we dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top.  thanks. but the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was. 
<ross> i had no idea. and that-that pillowcase thing, i thought you guys were just doing the flying nun. 
<monica> sometimes we were. 
<ross> come on. you gotta help me figure out what to do. okay? 
<monica> okay. 
<ross> come on.  
<chandler> that was pretty intense huh? 
<joey> yeah.  hey, i hope ross didnt think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here! 
<chandler>  i hope he did!

<phoebe> hey, joey! hey! ooh! ooh! i just say someone on thethat looks just like you on the subway. and i was gonna go over and say hi! but then i figured, he doesnt care if he looks like you. 
<joey> that just cost me four bucks. but uh listen, i just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing? 
<phoebe> ohh, theyre having a great time with their aunt phoebe! aunt rachel hasnt been helpful at all. so, do you miss me? 
<joey> kinda, but ive just been having way too much fun.

<rachel> yeah, i know, i know, i know he does. but i have to tell him how i feel! he deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision. 
<phoebe> thats not why youre going! youre going because you hope hes gonna say, "yeah, i love you too, rach. forget that british chippy." 
<rachel> ohhdo you think he will?!

<s> ...and that was all before 10 o'clock. the caterer rang and said it was going to be chicken kiev instead of chicken tarragon. and then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. we're not gonna be... 
<ross> whoa-whoa-whoa! emily,  honey, okay? 
<s> well, up yours too! 
<ross> what?! 
<s> oh, that's not what it means? 
<ross> no! no! that's-that's time-out! 
<s> sorry. 
<ross> sweetie, you gotta relax. everything's gonna be great, okay? come on. come on. 
<monica> chicken kiev? 
<ross> um-hmm! doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute? 
<monica> yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. and, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella.  but of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... so, i can't wait to see this place you're getting married! 
<ross> yeah. yeah. yes, this place is beautiful. emily's parents got married here. 
<s> i still can't believe they're tearing it down. it really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. i mean it's over...  oh my god! 
<monica> it's nice. 
<s> oh. oh.   
<s>  oh. oh my god. how can this be happening? what are we going to do? 
<ross> it's all right! everything's gonna be all right. 
<s> how's it gonna be all right?! 
<ross> uh-huh, i see that. 
<monica>  okay, i talked to the guy with the shovel and i found out what happened. 
<ross> what? what? 
<monica> they tore it down a few days early. 
< 
< 
<joey> all right! westminster abbey! hands down, best abbey i've ever seen. hey!  okay. what do you think of the abbey, chandler? 
<chandler> i think it's great. it's great. y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place. 
<joey> really? to what? 
<chandler> to put the camera away!!! 
<joey> man, you are westminster crabby.  
< 
<monica> don't worry. you'll find some place to get married.  
<monica> oowww!! 
<s> sorry. lucky this dress is red! 
<s> we can't find another place. then we can't have the wedding! i've ordered chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. what should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just sunday with a spectacular amount of food! 
<monica> you're gonna find a place. but even if - god forbid - you didn't.. so you postpone the wedding. is that really so bad? i mean, think about it. you could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. you could have tulips, you could have salmon.... mmmmm... salmon!! 
<s> i suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... oh, thank you! 
<monica> but either way... you're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me.  
<monica> oh, god... she's told you that already, didn't she?! 
< 
<phoebe> oh. oh. 
<rachel> oh, honey! don't get up! what do you need? 
<phoebe> oh, no. oh, nothing. 
<rachel> come on! i am here to take care of you! what do you need? anything. 
<phoebe> okay, i have a wedgie. 
<rachel> okay, that is all you. 
<phoebe> so-so, what do you want for lunch? 
<rachel> oh, i don't know. i guess we have to eat. 
<phoebe> yeah, i do. what's the matter? 
<rachel> i'm just bummed about the way i left things with ross. i shouldn't have lied to him about having to work. he seemed so mad at me. 
<phoebe> eh, don't be so hard on yourself. if someone i was still in love with was getting married... 
<rachel>  still in love with?! 
<phoebe> yeah! 
<rachel> i'm not in love with ross! 
<phoebe> oh. no. no. good! yeah, me neither. 
<rachel> phoebe, i'm going to ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. not because, i'm still in love with him! i mean, hey, y'know, i like ross as much as the next guy, y'know? clearly i have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love! i mean, i still have loving feelings for ross. yeah! but, i have, i have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that i'm still in love with him. y'know? i-i have sexual feelings for him, but i do love him-ohh! oh my god! oh my-why didn't you tell me?!! 
<phoebe> we thought you knew! 
<rachel> we?! 
<phoebe> yeah, we all know! we talk about it all the time! 
<rachel> you all know? does ross know? 
<phoebe> oh no, ross doesn't know anything. 
<rachel> oh, i can not believe you didn't tell me! 
<phoebe> well, because we thought you knew!! it's so obvious! god, that would be like telling monica, "hey, you like things clean." or, y'know, "hey, joey, you're gay."  
<rachel> what?! 
<phoebe> oh, please! she's always got a broom in her hand! 
< 
<joey> hey! post cards... 
<joey> check this out? huh?  yeah. that's the stuff. what do you think? 
<chandler> well, i don't have to buy that, "i'm with stupid" t-shirt anymore. 
<joey> well, i like it. here you go.  
<chandler> all right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day? 
<joey> oh, i embarrass you? 
<chandler> how can i answer that when i'm pretending i don't know you? 
<chandler> oh really? then how come no one here is wearing them? 
<chandler> all right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself. 
<joey> oh yeah?  if you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? i choose the hat. 
<joey> thanks. 
<chandler> okay, wait. all right, that's it, okay, i'm out of here. i am not going to be embarrassed anymore!   
<joey> how you doin'? joey tribbiani, america.  
< 
<s> hello? 
<ross> hey! i just spoke to your dad, and you know what? he seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding. 
<s> we don't have to. 
<ross> whoa-whoa-what? you found a place? 
<s> no. but, monica and i were talking, and-and i was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit. 
<ross> she said what? 
<s> she said, "if i'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it." 
<ross> postpone it? emily, do you think monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?  this isn't right. 
<s> i realise that people are going to be disappointed. but, i'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right. 
<ross> i can't ask people to do that? would you ask people to do that?  
<s> don't you point your pants at me!  we have no choice! anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, ross don't you understand? this is our wedding i'm talking about. 
<ross> the only thing i understand is; postponing it is not an option. this is when we're getting married. 
<s> so what are you saying? it's now or never? 
<ross> no. i'm saying it's now.  
<s> or? 
<ross> there's no 'or' in mind. what is wrong with these pants?!! 
<s> it's not the pants. it's you that is backwards. and if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all!  
<ross>  no, wait! emily! no, wait, stop! emily, please- commercial break 
< 
<phoebe> hey! 
<rachel>  hi. 
<phoebe> so, did shopping make you feel any better about ross? 
<rachel> manhattan does not have enough stores. 
<phoebe> well, i think i can help you get over him. 
<rachel> you can? 
<phoebe> yeah. i just need you to bring me some photos of ross. 
<rachel> um-hmm. 
<phoebe> and a small piece of chocolate. 
<rachel> okay. 
<phoebe> and a glass of tepid water.  
<rachel> ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree? 
<phoebe> uh, only if you have the hiccups too. yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. i just didn't feel like getting up. okay, i'm gonna show you a picture of ross. okay? and you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. all right? really focus on his flaws. 
<rachel> i can do that. i certainly did it when we were going out. 
<phoebe> okay. umm, before we get started, i just wanna say for the record that i love ross, i think he's such a great guy. here.  okay, now, close your eyes. and imagine that you're with ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him. and you're-you're running your hands all over his body. and then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck! hah? 
<rachel> i don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy. 
<phoebe> okay, this is going to be harder than i thought. umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy. 
<rachel> okay. 
<phoebe> okay? 
<rachel> all right. 
<phoebe> so uh, now look at the picture... 
<rachel> okay. 
<phoebe> all right, and umm...  
<rachel> ow! 
<phoebe> okay, how do you feel now? 
<rachel> well, i like you less! 
< 
<chandler> well, this is just as boring in england.  
<joey> hey. 
<chandler> hey.  
<joey> oh.  sorry! 
<chandler> no-no-no, y'know what? i really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, i mean that really wasn't cool. and if it makes you feel any better, i've had a really lousy day. 
<joey> me too. 
<chandler> yeah? 
<joey> noo!! i've had the best day ever! dude, check this out! now, i'm gonna fastforward past the part with you, 'cause it is boring. 
<monica>  hey! 
<joey> sh-shh-shh!   
<joey>  okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat. 
<s>  okay, so umm, what's your friend's name? 
<joey>  oh, chandler. 
<s> hi chandler!  
<chandler> that's... that's was... 
<monica> oh my god! 
<joey> that's fergie baby!! 
<s> joey says you don't really like his hat, but i think it's kinda dashing. 
<joey>  so, i hear you're single now... 
<s> yeah, ummm, i don't like the hat that much.  
<chandler> how did you? how? how? 
<joey> well, i was trying to figure out how to get to buckingham palace, right? so, i'm in my map and-and... hey! 
<monica> hey! 
<ross> hi. i understand you had a little talk with emily. 
<monica>  yes, i did! and you are welcome! 
<ross> am i?! and was it your idea to postpone the wedding?! 
<monica> umm... 
<chandler> i'm gonna go to the bathroom. 
<joey> wait up!  
<ross> hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all? 
<monica> she said that?! 
<ross> yeah. 
<monica> why?! 
<ross> i don't know, i told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out. 
<monica> oh my god. you're even dumber than i am! 
<ross> excuse me? 
<monica> ross, how long have you been planning this wedding? 
<ross> i don't know. a month? 
<monica> emily has probably been planning it since she was five! ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. that's what we did! we dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top.  thanks. but the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was. 
<ross> i had no idea. and that-that pillowcase thing, i thought you guys were just doing the flying nun. 
<monica> sometimes we were. 
<ross> come on. you gotta help me figure out what to do. okay? 
<monica> okay. 
<ross> come on.  
<chandler> that was pretty intense huh? 
<joey> yeah.  hey, i hope ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here! 
<chandler>  i hope he did! 
< 
<phoebe> ooh! i thought of a good flaw! ross pops his gum! 
<rachel> oh, right!  wait a minute, i do that too. 
<phoebe> yeah, i know. it drives me crazy.  
<phoebe> i'll get it.  
<phoebe> hello. 
<joey>  hey, pheebs! it's joey! 
<phoebe> hey, joey! hey! ooh! ooh! i just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. and i was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then i figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you. 
<joey> that just cost me four bucks. but uh listen, i just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing? 
<phoebe> ohh, they're having a great time with their aunt phoebe! aunt rachel hasn't been helpful at all. so, do you miss me? 
<joey> kinda, but i've just been having way too much fun.

<s> let's see what we got here. ohh, y'know, fonzie dated triplets. 
<chandler> this-this fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?

<chandler> all right.  
<s> it's not that weird, is it? 
<phoebe> it's very weird! i don't want some guy down there telling me, i'm y'know, dilatedamundo! 
<ross> to be fair, he doesnt seem to be impersonating fonzie 
<phoebe>  what are you doing?!! why are you defending him?! just get me another doctor! one who is not crazy and who is not fonzie! 
<ross> again, it's not that he  
< 
<chandler>  oh-hey-hey-hey! there you are! 
<monica> umm, listen there's something i think you should know. 
<chandler> oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? yeah, joey already told me, and i am so-so fine. i mean, you and i we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around. 
<monica> umm, actually i was about to tell you that i was, i was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe i will go out with him. 
<chandler> fine! maybe i will too! 
<joey>  hey, you guys! look what i found in the giiiiiiift shop.  get up! get up! get up!  
< 
<ross> okay, phoebe, this dr. oberman. he has no strong feelings about fonzie or any of the happy days gang. 
<phoebe> hi! and you're going into what grade? see, i-i graduated early 
<phoebe>  uh-huh, me too. ross, maybe i should've specified that i'd be needing a grown up doctor. 
<phoebe> shh! doogie, shh! doesn't anybody understand that i'm gonna be having babies soon? huh? go! go little boy, go!  
<s> oh cool! you made him cry!

<rachel> phoebe, no! this is, this is insane. 
<phoebe> oh, just ask him! 
<rachel> me?! 
<phoebe> i can't ask him! do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! all i'm saying is just talk to frank. okay? just, y'know, feel him out! 
<rachel> no! forget it! i am not gonna ask frank to give you one of his kids!! 
<phoebe> you're right.  
<phoebe> tell him it's for you.

<chandler> y'know, i don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary well, i have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. but if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. i am so bad at this. 
<monica> i think you're better than you think you are.

<joey>  he's talking to london! 
<monica> but why?! did he get in touch with emily? 
<joey> well no, not yet. he's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her. 
<ross>  i-i-i don't care if i said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit! 
<joey> ross! way to suck up to the family. 
<chandler>  ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. i'm so glad you guys are all here! my office finally got wrinkle free fax paper! opening credits 
< 
<joey>  hey!

<joey> don't worry, i had it dry-cleaned. 
<monica> vomit tux? who vomited ony'know what, what you up to joe? 
<joey> well, i'm doing this telethon thing on tv and my agent got me a job as co-host! 
<monica> oh that's great! 
<joey> a little uh, good deed for pbs and a little tv exposure, now that's the kind of math joey likes to do! 
<phoebe> ugh, pbs! 
<monica> what's wrong with pbs? 
<phoebe> ugh, what's right with them? 
<joey> why dont you like pbs, pheebs? 
<phoebe> okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, i was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. so, i just thought that it'd make me feel better if i wrote to sesame street, 'cause they were so nice when i was a little kid! no one ever wrote back. 
<chandler> well y'know a lot of those muppets don't have thumbs. 
<phoebe> all i got was a lousy key chain! and by that time i was living in a box. i didn't have keys! 
<joey> i'm sorry pheebs, i just, y'know, i just wanted to do a good deed. like-like you did with the babies. 
<phoebe> this isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on tv! this is totally selfish. 
<joey> whoa! whoa! whoa! what about you, having those babies for your brother? talk about selfish! 
<phoebe> what-what are you talking about?! 
<joey> well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right? 
<phoebe> yeah. so? 
<joey> it made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry. 
<phoebe> yes there are! there are totally good deeds that are selfless. 
<joey> well, may i ask for one example? 
<phoebe> yeah, it's y'know there'sno you may not!  
<joey> that's because all people are selfish. 
<phoebe> are you calling me selfish?! 
<joey> are you calling you people?  yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. okay? and you the deal on santa clause right? 
<phoebe> i'm gonna find a selfless good dead. i'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.  
<ross>  hello. 
<s>  hello, ross? 
<ross> emily? emily! oh my god! oh my god, it's emily!  it's emily everyone! shush-shush-shhst!  hi!

<ross> no wait! look, wait! okay, you can hang up, but i'm gonna keep calling! i'm gonna, i'm gonna call everyone in england if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me! 
<s> really? about what? 
<ross> look you're my wife. we're-we're married. y'know? i-i love you. i-i really miss you. 
<s> i miss you to. well, at least i think i do. 
<ross>  she's talking. 
<s>  yay!  
<phoebe> hey, joey, when you said the deal with santa clause, you meant? 
<joey> that he doesn't exist. 
<phoebe> right.  
< 
<rachel> so chandler, have you heard about monica's secret boyfriend? 
<chandler> uhh, yeah. she uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him. 
<rachel> so mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man? 
<monica> ohh, he's really shy. i-i dont think he's up to meeting everyone yet. 
<chandler> yeah, i don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet. 
<rachel> i dont care! i wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!  
<chandler> really?! that's what you heard?  you said that? 
<monica> i might've said that.  why is that funny? 
<chandler> because i'm very happy for him!  and you, you lucky dog! 
<ross>  hi! 
<monica> hey! 
<ross> well, emily's willing to work on the relationship. 
<chandler> yes! 
<monica> that's great! 
<ross> in london! 
<monica> what?! 
<ross> she wants me to move to london. 
<monica> but you live here!  you know that. 
<rachel> what-what-what are you gonna do? 
<ross> i bet if i talk to carol and susan i can convince them to move to london with ben. 
<monica> yeah, i'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife. 
<ross> it could happen. 
< 
<joey>  how ya doin'? welcome. good to see ya! 
<joey> that's great. but uh, i'm not really expecting a lot of calls. 
<joey> but i'm the host! 
<joey> you don't seem to understand. see, i was dr. drake remoray. 
< 
<phoebe> i cannot believe i can't find a selfless good deed! y'know that old guy that lives next to me? well, i snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. but he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. then i felt wonderful. that old jackass! 
<rachel> maybe joey's right. maybe all good deeds are selfish. 
<phoebe> i will find a selfless good deed! 'cause i just gave birth to three children and i will not let them be raised in a world where joey is right! 
<chandler>  hey, monica? can i ask you a cooking question? 
<monica> sure! 
<chandler> if you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than richard? 
<rachel> chandler!  is he? 
<monica> well, y'know i-i-i think i'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend. 
<chandler> why?! i mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, i'd be going like this.  
< 
<ross> all right emily, as much as i love you, i'm sorry, i can't move to london without ben. 
<s> i understand that would be difficult. 
<ross> yeah, would you please consider moving here? i mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that? 
<s> i don't know, it's just 
<ross> oh-oh-okay, but-but i know, that even though i've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, i mean, i mean you-you-you have to come here. you have to come here so we can work this out. 
<s> all right. 
<ross> all right, did you just say all right? 
<s> i did. now i'm the idiot. 
<ross> oh, emily that is, that is so great. it's gonna be so great! we're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!  
<s> ross, there's one thing that really scares me still. 
<ross> yes, tell me. 
<s> well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends. 
<ross> i know. i am, i am so sorry. 
<s> and then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her. 
<ross> again, very sorry. 
<s> i mean, i can't-i can't be in the same room as her! it drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her! 
<ross> emily, there is nothing between rachel and me. okay? i love you. 
<s> all right. i'll come to new york and we'll try and make this work. 
<ross> oh that is so great! that's 
<s>  as long as you don't see rachel anymore. commercial break 
< 
<ross> so i asked emily if she would come to new york, and she said yes. 
<chandler> yes! 
<phoebe> ooh-ohh! 
<monica> great! 
<ross> no-no-no! only if i promise never to see rachel again. 
<phoebe> why? 
<monica> what?! you can'twhat did you tell her? 
<ross> i told her i'd have to think about it. i mean, how the hell am i supposed to make this kind of a decision?  i'm actually asking you! 
<chandler> well, you can't just not see rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends. 
<monica> yeah! but, he can't not exactly see emily, i mean that's his wife. 
<phoebe> yeah. 
<chandler> that's true! 
<phoebe> yeah, but you've known rachel since high school and you cannot just cut her out of your life. 
<chandler> that's true! 
<monica> no, you cannot. 
<ross> thanks for the help, problem solved.   
<monica>  hello. 
<joey>  hey mon! 
<monica> oh hey joey! we've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on tv? 
<joey> see, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but i'm still on tv and that's good exposure. 
<monica>  you're not on tv. 
<joey> oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?  
<chandler> hey, there he is! there he is! 
<joey> hello new york!  
< 
<s>  now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! who cares, y'know? now i got the legs  
<chandler> how many times have i told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel! 
<monica>  hi chandler. 
<chandler> hey! 
<monica> uh, listen, i need that broiling pan that joey borrowed the other day. 
<chandler> oh that was yours? uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars. 
<monica> william sonoma, fall catalog, page 27. 
<chandler> expect it in 4-6 weeks.  umm, hey, umm, joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves. 
<monica> yeah, so? 
<chandler> well i just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had. 
<monica> y'know what, champ? i think i'll pass. 
<chandler> why? 
<monica> why?  
<chandler> what's your point? 
< 
<joey>  pbs telethon. 
<phoebe>  hey joey, i just wanted to let you know that i found a selfless good deed. i just went down to the park and i let a bee sting me. 
<joey> what?! what good is that gonna do anybody? 
<phoebe> well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. the bee is happy and i am definitely not. 
<joey> now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya. 
<phoebe>  aw, dammit!   
<joey> hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me? 
<joey> come on man! you've been here all day! performance of cirque du soleil,  and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. all you have to do  is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to  
< 
<ross>  okay, that's it. i cannot make this decision! it is too difficult, so i'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate.  
<monica> a magic eight ball?! you can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy! 
<phoebe> ooh, it's not a toy. 
<ross> well, i don't know what else to do. i mean, i either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or i keep my friend and get divorced the second time before i'm 30! so-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'cause i-i got nothing! all right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.  okay then. here we go. magic 8 ball, should i never see rachel again?  ask again later. later is not good enough.  ask again later. what the hell! this is broken! it-it is broken! 
<monica> all right, let me see.  will chandler have sex tonight?  don't count on it. seems like it works to me. 
< 
<joey>  pbs telethon. 
<phoebe>  hi joey. 
<joey> hey pheebs! 
<phoebe> i would like to make a pledge. i would like to donate $200. 
<joey> $200? are you sure pheebs? i mean, after what sesame street did to ya? 
<phoebe> oh, i'm still mad at them but i also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, i'm doing a good thing, but i'm not happy about it. so there, a selfless good deed. 
<joey> and you don't a little good about donating the money? 
<phoebe> no, it sucks. i was saving up to buy a hamster. 
<joey> a hamster? what, those things are like 10 bucks. 
<phoebe> yeah, not the one i had my eye on. thank you viewers! the pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers  oh boy! and may i say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers,  mr. joseph tribbiani! 
<phoebe> oh, look-look, joey's on tv! isn't that great? my pledge got joey on tv! oh that makes me feeloh no!  
< 
<chandler>  look, maybe i got carried away before. but there's something you gotta know. if i'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best. 
<monica> keep talking. 
<chandler> i mean i was nothing before you. call the other girls and ask. which wouldn't take long. but when i'm with you, and we're together, oh my god. 
<monica> really? 
<chandler> oh-aw my god! now, i understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. we're too good! we owe it, to sex! 
<monica> well, if we owe it?  oh my when is joey gonna be home? 
<chandler> well, i was kinda hoping we could do this without him.  oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on. 
<monica> but, i just cleaned the bathroom. 
<chandler> yeah, why don't we lose the gloves. 
<monica> yeah.   
<chandler> all right, let's show them how it's done. 
<monica> okay.  
<monica> ow!

<rachel> sure. i guess. hey, i hear you don't have to go to london. yay! 
<ross> it's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff. 
<rachel> like what? 
<ross> just stuff. y'know kinda what emily wants. 
<rachel> well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe i can help. 
<ross> no. no. you-you can't help. i mean, i kinda have to do this without your help. 
<rachel> well, i-i know you can do that too. i'm just, i'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to hi! 
<ross> thanks. 
<rachel> ross? look, whatever this relationship stuff that emily wants, just give it to her. come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. so just fix whatever she wants fixed. just do it.  i mean, you're gonna have to try. you'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't.  oh come on answer it! it's driving me crazy! 
<ross>  hello.  hi sweetie.  good. look umm, yes i've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, i can do it.  so will you come to new york?  ending credits

<monica> well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! this is what 9 looks like. 
<joey> i guess i'll get washed up then. watch that sunrise.  
<monica> i'm really getting tired of sneaking around. 
<chandler> i know, me too. hey! y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time. 
<monica> all weekend? that's a whole lotta naked. 
<chandler> yeah, i can say that i have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing. 
<monica> ohh, i've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in jersey!

< 
<monica>  hey, guess what i'm doing this weekend! i'm going to this culinary fair in new jersey. 
<phoebe> oh weird, chandler just told us he's got a conference there! 
<monica> oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like chandler's conference could've been in connecticut or vermont. 
<chandler> i'm not in charge of where the conference is held. do you want people to think it's a fake conference? it's a real conference. 
<ross>  hey. 
<joey> hey!

<ross> i told emily to come. and i just need to y'know, talk to rachel about it. 
<phoebe> wait a minute! so when emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see rachel anymore? 
<ross> well look, i'm just trying to focus on the "i get to see my wife," part, all right? and not the part that makes me do this.  
<monica> wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? how is that even gonna work? 
<ross> i have no idea. i mean but-but i assure you i will figure it out.  
<joey> doesnt seem like it's going to work, i mean 
<rachel>  hi, guys! 
<joey> hi! 
<chandler> uh, hey! 
<rachel> what's going on? 
<chandler> we're flipping monica's mattress.

<phoebe> yeah that's better than my way.  
<rachel> oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too? 
<chandler> aww, man!  
<rachel>  oh look! a letter from my mom.

<chandler> oh yes, somebody just said, "can you hear anything?"  
<monica> hey, joey's ass! what are you doing? 
<joey>  well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? well, when ross said rachel at the wedding, i figured it was gonna happen again, so i hid this in here. 
<monica> ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles 
<phoebe> ooh, madlibs, mine!  
<chandler> condoms? 
<joey> you don't know how long we're gonna be in here! we may have to repopulate the earth. 
<chandler> and condoms are the way to do that?  
<ross> anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time i talked to emily 
<rachel>  oh my god! my dog died! 
<ross> what?! 
<rachel> oh my god, le poo, our dog! 
<ross> le poo's still alive?! 
<rachel> oh god, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. oh.  oh my god. 
<monica> sweetie, we heard you crying. please don't cry. 
<rachel> it's le poo. 
<phoebe> i know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.

<chandler> oh yes! monica, get in here! there's a high-speed car chase on!  
<monica> we're switching rooms. 
<chandler>  oh dear god, they gave us glasses! 
<monica> no, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! i mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change.  come on sweetie, i just want this weekend to be perfect, i mean we can change rooms, can't we? 
<chandler> okay, but let's do it now though, because chopper 5 just lost it's feed!

<ross> hey, so uh, y'know how there's something i wanted to talk to you about? 
<rachel> oh yeah!  
<ross> well, y'know how i'm trying to work things out with emily. well, there's this one thing okay,  here goes. i made a promise that--oh hey!

<rachel> oh god.  no! oh not again!  this-this happened when my grandfather died. it's ugh! sorry.  oh, okay, so i'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me? 
<ross> umm

<rachel> yeah, i know. it's ridiculous! i can't see you either. 
< 
<chandler> okay, great.  
<chandler> half a tank? we still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do! 
<monica> we're switching rooms again. 
<chandler> what? why? 
<monica> this is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room. 
<monica>  excuse me, umm, can i talk to you over here for just a second? 
<chandler> uh-huh.  
<monica> chandler! 
<chandler>  yeah. 
<monica> look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and i'm not gonna let 'em! and we're not a couple of suckers! 
<chandler> i hear ya, mugsy! but look, all these rooms are fine okay? can you just pick one so i can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you. 
<monica> okay, this one i like! 
<chandler>  nothing! it's over! dammit! this is regularly scheduled programming! 
<monica> can we turn the tv off? okay? do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this? 
<chandler> oh, i'm sorry, am i getting in the way of all the room switching fun? 
<monica> hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight! 
<chandler> oh, who should i blame? the nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms? 
<monica> i don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from albany to canada on a half a tank of gas! 
<chandler> do not speak ill of the dead. 
<monica> we're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you? 
<chandler> i just want to watch a little television. what is the big deal? geez, relax mom. 
<monica> what did you say? 
<chandler> i said, "geez, relax monnnnn." 
< 
<rachel> hi! 
<ross> hey. rachel, i-i-i've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and i really, i just have to get it out. 
<rachel> okay, what's up? 
<ross> okay, y'know how you told me i should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage? 
<rachel> yeah, i told you to give emily whatever she wants. 
<ross> and while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants 
<rachel> yeah? 
<ross> is for me not to see you anymore. 
<rachel> that's crazy! you can't do that! what are you going to tell her?   oh god. ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you? 
<ross> it's awful i know, i mean, i feel terrible but i have to do this if i want my marriage to work. and i do, i have to make this marriage work. i have too. but the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here. 
<rachel> ohh! lucky me! oh my god! that is good news, ross! i think that's the best news i've heard since le poo died! 
<ross> you have no idea what a nightmare this has been. this is so hard. 
<rachel> oh yeah, really? is it ross? yeah? okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you. 
<ross> what are you doing? 
<rachel> storming out! 
<ross> rachel, this is your apartment.

<joey> how was your conference? 
<chandler> it was terrible. i fought with  my colleagues y'know, the entire time. are you kidding with this?  
<joey> oh, so your weekend was a total bust? 
<chandler> uh, no, i got to see donald trump waiting for an elevator. 
<monica>  hi! 
<joey> hey, you're back too! 
<monica> yeah. umm, chandler can i talk to you outside for a second? 
<joey> hey, how was your chef thing? 
<monica> oh, it was awful.  i guess some people just don't appreciate really good food. 
<chandler> well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea. 
<monica> chandler!  
<chandler> monica.   
<monica> okay, i'd like to know how much the room was because i'd like to pay my half. 
<chandler> okay, fine, $300. 
<monica> 300 dollars?! 
<chandler> yeah, just think of it as $25 per room! 
<monica> urghh!! 
<joey>  what are you guys woofing about? 
<monica> chandler stole a twenty from my purse! 
<joey> nooooo!!! y'know what? now that i think about it, i constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots! 
< 
<ross> you should've seen the look on her face. i don't want rachel to hate me! i don't know what to do. 
<joey> you want my advice? 
<ross> yes! please! 
<joey> you're not gonna like it. 
<ross> that's okay. 
<joey> you got married to fast. 
<ross> that's not advice! 
<joey> i told ya. 
<ross> i'm going to the bathroom.  
<joey> man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, i couldn't do it. 
<s> yeah, me either. 
<monica> maybe i could do it. 
<rachel>  hi! 
<joey> hi, rach. 
<chandler> hi! 
<phoebe> hey. 
<monica> hey. 
<rachel> look, i know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and ross but y'know, i've been obsessing about it all day and i'd just love not to talk about it. all right? 
<joey> i-i-i don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, ross is right back there.  
<rachel> that's not ross! 
<phoebe> oh no! not that guy! he does look like him though. 
<chandler> okay, ross is in the bathroom. 
<rachel> oh my god, its happening. it's already started. i'm kip. 
<joey> hey, you're not kip! 
<rachel>  do you even know who kip is? 
<joey> who cares? you're rachel!  who's kip? 
<chandler> kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together. 
<joey> oh, that poor bastard. 
<rachel> see? yeah, you told me the story. he and monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? he got phased out! 
<monica> you're not gonna be phased out! 
<rachel> well, of course i am! it's not gonna happen to ross! he's your brother.  he's your old college roommate. ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. i just always assumed phoebe would be the one to go. 
<phoebe> ehh!! 
<rachel> honey, come on! you live far away! you're not related. you lift right out. 
< 
<chandler>  hey! 
<joey> hey, mr. bing. that uh, hotel you stayed at called. said someone left an eyelash curler in your room. 
<chandler> yes that was mine. 
<joey> 'cause i figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there. 
<chandler> yes that would have made more sense. 
<joey> y'know, i-i don't even feel like i know you anymore man! all right, look, i'm just gonna ask you this one time. and whatever you say, i'll believe ya.  were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?! 
< 
<rachel> phoebe?  i'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing.  you gotta come with me! 
<phoebe> come where? 
<rachel> wherever i go. come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones. 
<phoebe> okay, but try and get joey too. 
<ross>  pheebs, you mind if i speak to rachel alone for a sec? 
<phoebe> oh, sure!  bye ross!  forever. 
<ross> hi. 
<rachel> hi. what are you doing here? isn't this against the rules? 
<ross> i talked to monica, look, i'm the one who made the choice. i'm the one who's making things change, so i should be the one to y'know, step back. 
<rachel> oh, ross 
<ross> no, no, it's okay. really. they're plenty of people who just see their sisters at thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see joey at burger king. so is, is that better? 
<rachel> no, it's not better. i still don't get to see you. 
<ross> well, what-what would you do? rach, if you were me, what-what would you do? 
<rachel> well, for starters i would've said the right name at my wedding! 
<ross> i can't believe this is happening. 
<rachel> i know. 
<ross> i am so sorry. 
<rachel> i know that too. 
<joey>  hey, rach? sorry to interrupt but umm, phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something. 
< 
<chandler>  hey! 
<monica> hi.

<monica> yeah, it did. 
<chandler> so, i guess this is over. 
<monica> what? 
<chandler> well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime. 
<monica> why, exactly? 
<chandler> because of the weekend, we had a fight. 
<monica> chandler that's crazy! if you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer thanohhh!  
<chandler> so, this isn't over? 
<monica>  you are so cute! no. no, it was a fight. you deal with it and move on! it's nothing to freak out about. 
<chandler> really? okay. great! 
<monica> ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!

<monica> i'm afraid so. 
<chandler> okay.

<monica> yes, but you cannot tell anyone! no one knows! 
<joey> how?! when?! 
<chandler> it happened in london. 
<joey> in london!!! 
<chandler> the reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it. 
<joey> but it is a big deal!! i have to tell someone!  
<chandler> no-no-no-no-no! you can't! 
<monica> please? please?! we just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? just promise you won't tell.  
<joey> all right! man, this is unbelievable! i mean, it's great, but 
<monica> i know, it's great!  
<joey> aww, i don't want to see that!  
<phoebe> we're so stupid! do you know what's going on in there? they're trying to take joey! ending credits 
< 
<phoebe> the most popular phoebe in tennis is called the overhand phoebe. and if you win, you must slap your opponent on the phoebe and say, "hi, phoebe!" 
<monica> oh that's cute! we really all enjoyed it. but y'know, it doesn't count. 
<phoebe> count for what? 
<monica> count in our heads as-as good madlibs.  
<joey> i guess i'm done. 
<chandler> fun's over! 
<monica> wait-wait, guys! if-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something! 
<rachel> uh-huh! 
<joey> i think i'm gonna take-off. 
<monica> guys, rules are good! rules help control the fun! (they all leave and 
< 
<joey>  hey! hey! hey! hey!! none of that, not while you're living under my roof! 
<monica> what?! 
<joey> look, just because i know about you two, doesn't mean i like looking at it. 
<chandler> aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour? 
<joey> well, i'm sorry if i'm not a middle-aged black woman!  and i'm also sorry if sometimes i go to the wrong audition! okay, look, if i have to pretend i don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about. 
<monica> sorry. 
<chandler> sorry.  
<joey>  i can hear that! 
<monica>  rachel's at work.   
<joey> i can still hear you! opening credits 
< 
<phoebe> hey! 
<joey> hey! 
<chandler> hello! 
<monica> hey, what's that? 
<phoebe> yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. can you believe it?! a year ago i didn't even have a family, and now i have heirlooms for crying out loud.  
<phoebe> eeeee--ohh!! god!  
<joey> argh-argh!!  ooh, soft. is this mink? 
<phoebe> yeah! why would my mother send me a fur? doesn't she know me but at all! plus, i have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make! 
<chandler> yeah, just some 9-year-old filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.  that didn't happen, i made that up! 
<ross>  hey! 
<s> oh, ross? ross! you can't put up flyers in here. 
<ross> how come? everybody else does. 
<s> you can't. 
<monica> what is that? 
<ross> oh, umm, i'm just getting rid of a couple of things. 
<monica>  this is all of your things. 
<ross> yes, yes it is! no, but it's good it'semily thinks we should get all new stuff. stuff that's just ours, together. y'know brand new. 
<monica> so basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-rachel-ever-used sale. 
<ross> touched. used. sat on. sleep on. 
<s> i'll take it all. 
<joey> hey, ross, you're okay with that? 
<ross> look, if i can just do what emily wants and get her to new york, i'm sure everything will be fine. 
<chandler> okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme? 
<ross> after what i did? can you blame her? 
<phoebe> oh my god! you got off easy! when my friend silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.  
<joey>  what is he doing? what, emily, thinks ross's furniture has got rachel coodies? 
<monica> now calm down joey. 
<joey> no! everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? emily won't let ross see rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing rachel, hence ross stops seeing us! 
<phoebe> oh, i hate this. everything's changing. 
<chandler> yeah i know, we're losing ross, joey said hence 
<monica> look, i'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about emily to ourselves. are you cool with that? 
<joey> no! but y'know, i'm an actor, i'll act cool. 
< 
<rachel> ohh, whoa god! storage rooms give me the creeps! monica, come on please hurry up honey! please? 
<monica> rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until i find the little waffle iron. 
<rachel> i want the little round waffles. 
<monica> all right.  op, here it is! right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. i wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?  
<rachel> okay, y'know what? i'll-i'll have toast!  
<rachel> arghhhh!!!!!!  
<monica> oh my god! fog him! fog him!  
< 
<phoebe> i don't know what i'm gonna do about this coat. 
<joey> i'll take it! 
<phoebe> that might work!  
<joey> ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah!  enh? all right, what do you think? 
<chandler> you're on in 5 ms. minnelli. 
<ross>  no-no-no, it's just a bit sudden.  no, it's great. okay? i'm totally on board. i love you too, all righty. bye.  
<joey> what's the matter ross? 
<ross> nothing. oh, actually, great news! i just got off the phone with emily and it looks like i'm moving to a new apartment. woo-hoo! 
<phoebe> why? 
<ross> well, her thought is, and i agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and columbia on the other. 
<joey> that's way uptown! that's like three trains away!  which is great! i love to ride that rail! 
<chandler> so you're really okay with this? 
<ross> yes! yes! i mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, i'll get so much done on the commute. i-i've been given the gift of time! 
<chandler> now that's so funny, because last christmas i got the gift of space. we should get them together and make a continuum.  
<joey> now he's movin'? man, what is emily doing to him?  ow!! he's not even here!!!  
<rachel> you guys! you guys! 
<monica> we were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man! 
<rachel> it was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! he was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something! 
<monica> and he came at us with an axe, so rachel had to use a bug bomb on him! 
<rachel>  yeah, i-i-i just pulled the tab and i just fogged his yeti ass! 
<joey> uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard? 
<rachel> yeah! 
<joey> yeah, you fogged danny. 
<rachel> please! we did not fog danny! who's danny? 
<joey> dan just moved in downstairs. yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the andes. nice fella. 
<monica> oh he's nice. he's nice! y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog! 
< 
<s> yeah? 
<rachel> hi! you might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you. 
<monica> we're-we're really sorry we fogged you. 
<s> okay.  
<rachel> hi! just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something. 
<s> okay.  and he answers it.) 
<s> yesss? 
<rachel> hi! sorry to bother you, but i don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it. 
<monica> yeah. 
<s> o-kay!  
<monica> wow! that guy is so rude! 
<rachel> really! what is with that guy? i mean you'd forgive me if i fogged you. 
<monica> well you did a little bit. 
<rachel> oh my god, honey, i'm so sorry! 
<monica> i totally forgive you! 
<rachel> really? 
<monica> yes! 
< 
<phoebe> hey! 
<monica> hey! 
<phoebe> so listen, you know my friend chris who owns the crematorium? 
<monica> crematorium chris? sure! 
<phoebe> he says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if i umm, y'know, bring in the next person i know who dies.  
<rachel> oh my god! oh my god, look at these pelts! 
<monica> don't get too attached, she's having it cremated. 
<rachel> what? uhh, phoebe, honey, honey, i know you're quirky and i get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! not nature, fashion! 
<phoebe> this is fashion?!  okay, so to you, death is fashion?! that's really funny.  here's phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry russia. i mean, you really thing this looks good?  'cause i do. 
< 
<ross>  i know i miss you too. i can't wait to see you. i love you. bye.  
<chandler> okay, what is in here? rocks? 
<ross> no-no, this is my collection of fossil samples. 
<chandler> so, rocks.  
<ross> i'm really gonna miss this apartment. y'know, ben-ben took his first steps right over there.  
<joey> ohh. hey, remember when i ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little? 
<ross> i loved this place! to tell you the truth, i wish i didn't have to move. 
<joey> uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this? 
<ross> well, i mean if uh, if emily gave me a choice 
<joey> you do have a choice!! ross, why are you listening to her?! are you, are you crazy?! 
<ross> why? 
<joey> it's not right what emily wants you to do! she is totally--owww!! stop pinching me! look, now you guys said i only had to keep my mouth shut as long as ross was happy, right? well he just told me that he's not entirely happy. 
<ross> what's going on? 
<joey> we all hate emily! 
<phoebe> nooo!! 
<monica> no, ross, we do not hate emily. we-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy. 
<joey> yeah! 
<chandler> look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable. 
<joey> yes! yes! unreasonable! 
<ross> unreasonable? how about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! you have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! all right, it's about compromise! do you always like it? no! do you do it? yes! because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at central perk all the time! it's real life, okay? it's what grown-ups do!  
<phoebe> i think he's right. you guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much. commercial break 
< 
<monica> god, i feel so guilty about ross. 
<phoebe> oh, i know. 
<joey> i kinda feel like it's my fault.  
<chandler> kind of? if you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened. 
<joey> well, i'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!  
<chandler> well, i think it's very brave what you said.  
<phoebe> all right, i can't sit here anymore. i have to walk places.  
<chandler> pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? how about the whole animal rights thing? 
<phoebe> well, i've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. okay, i admit it! i love this coat! okay, iit's the best thing i've ever had wrapped around me, including phil huntley!  remember phil huntley? he was fine! 
< 
<rachel> hi! 
<s> so you like the short hair better. 
<rachel> what? yetii mean danny? 
<s> i had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell. 
<rachel> oh. listen, i'm so sorry. i would, i would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so . y'know. 
<s> absolutely. some people are just into appearances. 
<rachel>  what? 
<s> that's cool. cool.  
<rachel> what? hey! no-no-no! this not cool! you don't even know me! 
<s> come on, you got the shopping bags and the sack's catalog. 
<rachel> so from that you think you've got me all figured out? well, you don't! y'know i-i could have toys for underprivileged kids in here! 
<s> do you? 
<rachel> well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with capri pants. 
<s> okay.  
<rachel> and stop saying that! i hate that! 
<s> okay!  
<rachel> fine! i judged you. i made a snap judgement. but you did it too! and you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! you can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! what does that say about you? 
<s> the pizza-place across the street any good? 
<rachel> what?! 
<s> i'm hungry. wanna get some pizza? you can keep yelling if there's more. 
<rachel> okay. okay. 
<s> stop saying that. i hate that. 
< 
<chandler> uh, ross? 
<phoebe> are you still mad at us? 
<ross> yep. 
<phoebe> oh good! because we have an "i'm sorry" song. 
<ross> y'know what? i'm really not in the mood. 
<joey> look, ross, i feel really bad. i mean, you're going through all this stuff and i just acted like a jerk. 
<chandler> yeah, we are so sorry. 
<phoebe>  you're kinda stepping on the song.  
<joey> look, we were way out of line, we totally support you. 
<monica> whatever you decide, whatever you do. 
<phoebe> okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song! 
<ross> look, this is hard enough! i really need you guys right now.

<rachel> yeah. 
<monica> and when he's naked i can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him! 
<rachel> then, you will definitely get him back!

<rachel> okay, oh, here's what you do. just act like everything around you turns you on.

<phoebe> okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between cathy and heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in england. which i think represents the wildness of heathcliff's character. i totally get symbolism. here , rachel green? 
<rachel> umm, well i would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story. 
<rachel> oh-oh-oh, symbolism! and uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which i think is-is mirrored in the wildness of heathcliff's character. 
<phoebe>  you completely stole my answer! 
<rachel> well, honey that was pretty obvious. 
<phoebe> well how would you know?! you didn't even read it! 
<phoebe> i think that uh, yours is a question with many answers. 
<phoebe> would you care to venture one? 
<phoebe> are you just repeating what i'm saying? 
<phoebe> okay then. 
< 
<phoebe> yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!

<ross> phoebe! you're note, amazing! not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. yeah, a guy called me mental! mental geller, yeah, i always wanted a cool nickname like that.

<monica> we're so sorry. 
<chandler> yeah. 
<joey> well, i'm telling everyone about you! that's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig! 
<chandler> no-no, wait! there's got to be a better explanation. you can tell them you had to make an adult film for your  adult film class. 
<joey> yeah, i like that. but no-no, how does that explain why rachel found my underwear at your place? 
<chandler> ohi don't know.

<monica> okay, just wait, please. i promise we'll come up with something. just give us a little more time.

<ross> yeah, of course, donald. part. 
<ross> what?! people now call you mental. 
<ross>  yeah. 
<ross> oh no, you-you don't understand. ugh, this is so silly. umm, this is all because of a sandwich. 
<ross> yeah. you see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; i call it the moist maker. anyway, i-i put my sandwich in the fridge over here 
<ross> what? 
<ross> you ate my sandwich? 
<ross>  oh-oh really? did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a moist maker? 
<ross> do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it? 
<ross>  that said it was my sandwich?! be in the trash. 
<ross>  what? away. 
<ross> you-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!

<rachel> well, i was gonna, but i accidentally read something else. 
<phoebe> what? 
<rachel> vogue! hey, so tell me about this jane eyre woman. 
<phoebe> no! you should've read it yourself! 
<rachel> come on phoebe! dont be such a goodie-goodie! 
<phoebe> fine! okay, all right, so jane eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. she's a cyborg. 
<rachel> a cyborg?! isn't that like a robot?! 
<phoebe> yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time. everybody think about jane eyre? 
<phoebe> umm, rachel and i were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights. 
<rachel> uh, thank you phoebe. umm, well, what struck me most when reading jane eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time. 
<rachel> yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots. 
< 
<chandler> hey. 
<monica> hey. okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, i thought that i would give you just a little preview.  
<chandler>  you're naked in this picture! 
<monica> i know.  
<chandler> ross? 
<ross>  hey chandler.  monica! 
<monica> ross, are you okay? 
<ross> i'm fine! i saw a psychiatrist at work today. 
<monica> why?! 
<ross> on account of my rage. 
<chandler> which i may say, right now, is out of control. 
<ross> he gave me a pill for it. 
<monica> a pill? 
<ross> uh-huh. well, when the psychiatrist told me i had to take a leave of absence because i yelled at my boss i started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. and i thought was a good idea so, i took it. 
<monica> wait a minute, they're making you take time off work? 
<chandler> and you're okay with that? 
<ross> i don't know. it's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but i, i definitely don't care about my sandwich. 
< 
<rachel>  ugh, that was so embarrassing! i can't believe you let me go on and on like that! 
<phoebe>  i'm sorry. it was just so funny when you started comparing jane eyre to robocop. 
<rachel> that was not funny! 
<phoebe> well, i snapped! okay? you weren't taking the class seriously. 
<rachel> phoebe, come on! what is the big deal? i thought this was going to be something we could do together! y'know, i thought it would be fun! 
<phoebe> well, yeah! fun is good, but y'know i also wanted to learn. y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and i never went to high school. 
<rachel> ohh. oh, so you really wanted to learn. yeah, y'know, pheebs i just wanted to have fun. ohh, you know who you should go with?

<rachel> look!  
<ross>  dude! that's my sister!  
<monica>  give me that! 
<phoebe> all right, wait! just wait. everybody just calm down. okay? let's give our friend joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert! 
<joey> no! i am not a pervert! okay? it's just i just kinda 
<chandler> all right, look! look. i think i can explain this.  
<joey> thank you! 
<chandler> joey's a sex addict. 
<joey> what?!!  no i'm not!! 
<monica> it's okay! it's good! it's good. it's a disease! 
<joey> no! no! i am not a sex addict! 
<monica> yes you are! that's the only way to explain all this stuff! 
<joey> no it isn't! no, it's not. because you can also explain it with the truth! 
<rachel> well, what is the truth? 
<ross> yeah, what's going on? 
<phoebe> what's going on? 
<joey>  i slept with monica. 
<chandler> well let's .let's see what everybody thinks of that? 
<monica> oh no! 
<ross> you slept with my sister? 
<joey> uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in london. 
<ross> this is not good for my rage.  
<rachel> monica, is this true? 
<joey> of course it's true! how else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on? 
<monica> yes it's true. 
<rachel> okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day? 
<joey> ahhoy! that was the underwear i was wearing that night in london. right monica? 
<monica> i guess i wanted to keep it  as a souvenir. 
<ross> my god monica!! 
<chandler> are you sure joe? are you sure you're not just a sex addict? 
<joey> no! if anyone's a sex addict here, it's monica! yeah. yeah. she has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since london! 
<phoebe> so that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself. 
<joey> that makes sense! 
<rachel> and the video camera? 
<joey> uhh, monica? 
<monica> i guess i set up the video camera to try and entice joey. 
<joey> but sadly i could not be enticed. 
<ross> unbelievable! i mean you really kept joey's underwear?! why? why would you do that?! 
<monica> i'm monica. i'm disgusting. i stalk guys and keep their underpants. 
<joey> well, i think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. eh? all right, now, i'm going to get back to my bucket. i'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.  ending credits

<ross> joey's not going. 
<joey>  i didn't finish my five pages. 
<chandler> well, why can't you do them tomorrow? 
<ross> because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages. 
<joey> yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work. 
<chandler>  why don't you cut him a little slack? okay? maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done. 
<ross> i think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and fireball. 
<joey> dude, if you think fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played. 
<chandler> the only reason you're doing this to joey is because you're bored. okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed. 
<ross> i am not unemployed. i'm on sabbatical! 
<joey> come on look guys, don't fight. 
<ross> and the reason i'm doing this is because i am joey's friend. and if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing. 
<chandler> oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk? 
<ross> if it does? then you're an amazing friend of mine. 
<joey> hey-hey guys, hey! how about we settle this over a friendly game of fireball? huh? i'll go unhook the smoke detectors! 
<ross> how about we settle this right now!  there! now, no one's going to the game. ha-ha-ha! 
<chandler> i paid for those tickets! 
<ross> no you didn't. you said you would, but you never did! 
<chandler> oh yeah!  
< 
<s> so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here  forgets the camera! 
<joey> oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time. 
<chandler> when did that happen to you?! 
<joey> don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picturei didn't have my camera! 
<chandler> oh yeah. first off all, chasing the churo guy isn't jogging.

<rachel> yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it. 
<s> what?! why?! 
<rachel> umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and 
<s> oh great! that special bond again! why do women have such a problem with the fact that i'm close with my sister? 
<rachel> well, okay, look. i don't know, listen, i don't know what's going on here but let's 
<s> do-do you, do you have brothers? 
<rachel> no, i have two sisters. but one of them has a very masculine energy. 
<s> are you close with them? 
<rachel> no-no, they're not very nice people. 
<s> okay, listen, i really like you. okay? i think this can go somewhere. so what if i'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?

<chandler> great! now, we can go to the ranger game!  last night! 
<joey> no dude, ross tore up the tickets! 
<ross> i guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. huh? 
<chandler> yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck all the live long day!! 
<joey> yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that i finished it. and uh, i think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if i could hear it. so would you guys read it for me?

<chandler> do you want us to leave the room, or? 
<ross> everyday i am gonna do one thing that i haven't done before. that my friends is my new year's resolution. 
<phoebe> ooh! that's a good one! mine is to pilot a commercial jet. 
<chandler> that's good one too, pheebs. now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths. 
<phoebe> maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to europe for free on their own plane. 
<monica> she has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us. 
<ross> in fact, i'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. eh, y'know what, better yet? a week. 
<chandler> i'll take that bet my friend. and you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!"  and it starts right now! 
<joey> all right, my new year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar. 
<ross> ohh. 
<phoebe> really?! how come? 
<joey> well, y'know those special skills i have listed on my resume? i would love it would be great if one of those was true.

<monica> hey rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less. 
<rachel> i don't gossip!  
<rachel> well, maybe sometimes i find out things or i hear something and i pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean i'm a gossip. i mean, would you call ted kopel a gossip? 
<monica> well if ted kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, i would.

<phoebe> hey everybody, rachel was so good today. she didn't gossip at all. 
<rachel> i didnt! even when i found out umm, all right, well let's just say i found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.

<joey> yeah!  
<monica> i like them a lot. 
<chandler> that's not what i had in mind! see, people like ross don't generally wear these types of pants. you see, they're very tight.  maybe there's something in that area.  
<ross> oh see, i-i needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and i thought to myself, "wow,  i never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."  
<chandler> oh come on!!

<chandler> i'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. and i wanted to give it up i justi didn't know what it was! 
<joey> chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her. 
<chandler> look, for the first time in my life i'm in a real relationship. okay, i'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth. 
<ross>  hey. 
<joey> whoa, dude, look out! you almost crushed my hat!  
<ross> sorry. 
<chandler>  and the bunny got away.  
<ross>  this would be the place where you explain the hat. 
<joey> oh! yeah, look there's this play all right? and i'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. a real clothes horse. so i figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff. 
<chandler> and you're gonna make them all disappear. 
<joey> yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.  
<chandler> done. 
<rachel> joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? i'll help you out. 
<joey> great! thanks, rach! 
<rachel> sure!  god, please take those off! 
<joey> all right.  
<ross> hey pheebs, how's it going? 
<chandler> hey. 
<phoebe> hey! umm, well, only okay because i just got back from, from the hospital.  
<rachel> what? 
<ross> is everything okay? 
<joey> are you all right? 
<phoebe> oh yeah, no-no-no. i'm fine. i'm okay, but umm, my grandma sorta died. 
<joey> pheebs! sorry! 
<phoebe> it's okay, i mean she had a really incredible life. and it's not like i'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit. 
<rachel> well maybe, maybe she's with us right now? 
<phoebe> yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse! 
<monica>  guys! guys! i just saw two people having sex in a car right outside. 
<ross> uhh, pheebs' grandmother just died. 
<monica> ohh my god, i'm so sorry. 
<phoebe> it's okay. actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins. 
<monica>  not the way they're doing it. what, what happened? how did she die? 
<phoebe> well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again. 
<joey> pheebs, i'm so sorry. 
<phoebe> it was really sweet. the last thing she said to me was; "okay dear, you go get the eggs and i'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." and y'know what? we will meet at the checkout counter. 
< 
<rachel> okay now joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear? 
<joey> all right, then you'd better show me some of that too then. 
<rachel> okay, it's missing something. ooh, i know! umm, okay.  
<joey> really? a purse? 
<rachel> it's not a purse! it's a shoulder bag.

<rachel> no joey, look. trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. look.  see look, men, carrying the bag. 
<joey> see look, women, carrying the bag.  but it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.

<rachel> why?! why not?! 
<phoebe> come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! what do you think? he's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned! 
<joey> what did you say to him? 
<phoebe> well, i said, i told him y'know, that i was the executor person of francis' will and that i needed to talk to him so i'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later. 
<phoebe> all right, well, i just can't think about that right now. i just wanna say good-bye to my grandma.

<chandler> and a date with a man! 
<joey> y'know what? make fun all you want. this is a great bag! okay? and it's as handy as it is becoming. now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. all right? so from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that joey,  comes with a bag!

<rachel> ooh, pheebs, what are you gonna say? are you gonna tell him who you are?

<ross> well, but aren't you pissed at him?! i mean this guy abandoned you! i gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger!  i mean i-i-i'd walk in there and i'd be like, "yo, dad! you and me outside right now!"  i kinda scared myself. 
<monica> well, at least you scared someone. 
<phoebe> y'know it's funny, you'd think i'd be angry. i mean, you'd think i'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. fortunately, i'm past it. 
<monica> phoebe, you do seem a little tense. here, let me help you. 
<phoebe> all right.  
<phoebe> oh! get off!! ow!! oh, stop it!! why?! why are you doing that to me?! 
<monica> what are you talking about?

<monica> what?! 
<chandler> i'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww! 
<monica> you've been lying to me? i can't believe you'd do that. 
<ross> well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings. 
<monica> but the minute we start to lie to each other  and by 'we' i mean society. 
< 
<joey>  well, you must be new here. why don't we get a table and i'll buy you a drink. without the purse? 
<joey> yeah, sure.  well, you must be new here. maybe we shouldi'm sorry, can i ask you something?  
<joey> well, first it's not a purse. 
<joey> i mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. it's a man's bag! 
<joey> all right look, let me show you the catalog!  see? huh? it's the latest thing! everyone's got one! men! women! children! everyone's carrying them!

<chandler>  i don't like your massages. 
<monica>  see? it's no big deal. 
<chandler> okay, but now see you're crying! 
<monica> i'm not crying about that! i'm crying about something that happened at work. 
<chandler> what? 
<monica>  my boyfriend said he didn't like my massages. 
<chandler> it's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything. 
<monica> oh my god! you don't know me at all! 
<chandler> okay, you give the worst massages in the world. 
<monica> i'm crying here!! 
<chandler> okay, hear me out. okay? you give the best bad massages. if anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "who's the best of that?" they'd have to go to you. 
<monica> huh. so you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that? 
<chandler> oh, it would be you! you! monica! and you'd get all the votes! 
<monica> so maybe they could umm, call the award the monica? 
<chandler> absolutely! 
<monica> okay. i suck! 
<chandler> yeah!  
< 
<phoebe> umm, thank you for meeting with me.

<s> yes, yes i was. 
<phoebe> okay, umm, question 2) umm, did that marriage end a. happily, b. medium, or c. in the total abandonment of her and her two children? 
<s> it really says that?! 
<phoebe> yeah. see?  
<s> well then i guess then i-i would i would have to say c. 
<phoebe> hmm, okay, total abandonment. okay, reasons for abandonment, a. top secret government work, b. amnesia, or c. or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man? 
<s> y'know, i don't think i want the lipstick that much.  but umm oh, would you do me a favor? and umm, would you, would you give lilly that, please?  
<phoebe> what?! 
<s> well lilly, when you see lilly would you give her that, that note? because i wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well i pictured her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and i well, i chickened out. so, uh, i wrote her that note, would you give it to her please? 
<phoebe> but you-you-you came to see lilly? 
<s> yeah, yeah. why? 
<phoebe> lilly's dead.  
<s> she what?! 
<phoebe> she's dead.

<phoebe> 17 years ago. 
<s> oh! what about, what about the girls? 
<phoebe> well, ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in soho. and phoebe,  is on this couch.

<phoebe> yes. well, that's neither here nor there. 
<s> so would it, would it make you feel better if i said i was very, very sorry that i left? 
<phoebe> y'know what, it doesnt matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go. 
<s> all right. well, y'know in my defense i was a lousy father. 
<phoebe> that's a defense? 
<s> yes. yes it is. i burned the formula and i put your diapers on backwards. i mean, i made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more! 
<phoebe> you make up songs? 
<s> well no, just-just that one. but, it was stupid. let's see, how did it, how did it go. umm.  sleepy girl, sleepy girl. why won't you go to sleep? sleepy girl, sleepy girl. you're, you're, you're keeping me uppp!  yeah.

<joey> well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag! 
<chandler> oh my god! 
<ross> nooooo!

<rachel> honey wait, joey, im sorry i mean as terrific as i think you are with it  
<chandler> oh, hey!  
<rachel> i just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag. 
<joey> i can't believe i'm hearing this! 
<rachel> wait a minute! wait a minute! i'm not saying that you shouldnt have a bag, i justit's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial. 
< 
<phoebe>  oh hey, you guys, look! ugly naked guy is putting stuff in boxes!  
<rachel> i'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving. 
<ross> ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes. 
<rachel> ohh, i'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt. 
<chandler> and we're done with the chicken fried rice. 
<ross> hey! hey! if he's moving, maybe i should try to get his place! 
<s> good idea! yes! 
<ross> it would be so cool to live across from you guys! 
<joey> hey, yeah! then we could do that telephone thing! y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string! 
<chandler> or we can do the actual telephone thing. opening credits 
< 
<ross> oh my god! i love this apartment! isn't it perfect?! i can't believe i never realized how great it is!

<joey> you mean how they're friends and nothing more?  
<rachel> no. joey, she knows! we were at ugly naked guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window.  actually, we saw them doing it up against the window. 
<phoebe> okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that rachel knows? 
<joey> yes, but y'know what? it doesn't matter who knows what. now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over! 
<phoebe> or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own. 
<rachel> wh-what do you mean? 
<phoebe> well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do. 
<rachel> ohhh, i-i would enjoy that! 
<joey> no-no-no! no-no wait rach, you know what would even be more fun? telling them. 
<rachel> ehhh, no, i wanna do phoebe's thing. 
<joey> i can't take any 
<phoebe> no! you don't have to do anything! just don't tell them that we know!

<joey> oh yeah? well, you don't know about hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.  
<rachel>  so umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them? 
<joey> ugh. 
<phoebe> well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate. 
<rachel> okay. 
<phoebe> and then. i would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. my sexuality. 
<chandler>  hello children!

<phoebe> well actually you're the one person i can't tell this too. and the one person i want to the most. 
<chandler> what's going on? 
<phoebe> i think it's just y'know that i haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just dont even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffeeoh no, have i said to much? well it's just something to think about. i know i will.  
< 
<monica> you are so cute! how did you get to be so cute? 
<chandler> well, my grandfather was swedish and my grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny. 
<monica> okay, now you're even cuter!! 
<chandler> y'know that is a popular opinion today i must say. 
<monica> what? 
<chandler> the weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, i think, i think phoebe was hitting on me. 
<monica> what are you talking about? 
<chandler> i'm telling you i think phoebe thinks i'm foxy. 
<monica> that's not possible! 
<chandler> ow! 
<monica> i'm sorry it's just, phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way. 
<chandler> oh, y'know i-i can't hear that enough. 
<monica> i'm sorry, i think that you just misunderstood her. 
<chandler> no, i didn't misunderstand, okay? she was all over me! she touched my bicep for crying out loud! 
<monica> this bicep? 
<chandler> well it's not flexed right now!

<ross>  hey!

<ross> well, i called over there and it turns out ugly naked guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants. 
<rachel> oh. 
<ross> no-no, i got the edge. i know it's not exactly ethical but i sent him a little bribe to tip the scales in my direction. check it out, you can probably see it from the window.  
<monica> oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it? 
<ross> no. 
<chandler> that new mountain bike? 
<ross> no. 
<monica> well what did you send?

<phoebe> yeah, why don't you just find another apartment? 
<ross> look i've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one! 
<rachel> y'know what you should do? 
<ross> huh? 
<rachel> you should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. yeah! like if i would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. or uh, or my underwear. 
<joey> i'm listening. 
<rachel>  see? 
<ross> that is a great idea! and! i know ugly naked guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.

<joey> so he likes to break stuff. 
<ross> okay, i've got to go pick up ben but i-i will figure something out.  hey, didn't he used to have a cat?

<s> i came to talk to you about howard. 
<ross> howard? 
<s> yeah, he's the handy man. he's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing. 
<ross> oh that's nice. 
<s> yeah. so, do you want to give a check? or 
<ross> oh. uhh 
<s> oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! you can slip it under my door.  
<ross> no-no, it's not that, it's just i-i just moved in. 
<s> well, the guy's worked here for 25 years. 
<ross> yes, but i've lived here for 25 minutes. 
<s> oh, okay, i get it.  
<ross> no wait, look. look! i'm sorry, it's just i've never even met howard. i-i mean i don't know howard.

<s> okay, fine, whatever. welcome to the building.  
<ross>  ugh, can you believe that guy! 
<phoebe> yeah. i really like his glasses. 
< 
<ross> so then president steve told everyone that i was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! a little kid spit on my knee! y'know what i'm gonna do? i'm gonna throw a party. that's right. for everyone in the building, and i'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, i am not a bad guy. i am not a cheap guy! i'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. a man with principles. 
<chandler>  sounds like a fun party. 
<rachel> hmm. look, ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? the party's gonna cost you way more than that. 
<ross> it doesn't matter! it's my principles! we're talking about my principles! 
<rachel> okay, i thought it was about your neighbors liking you. 
<ross> oh, they'll like me. once they come to my awesome par-tay! okay, i gotta run. i gotta go get some nametags.  
<rachel> and that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law. 
<chandler> very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of monica. i don't want you putting any ideas in her head. 
<rachel> umm, chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in monica's head. 
<chandler> wh-wh-why?! 
<rachel> well, because she loves you and because you love her. 
<chandler> yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?! 
<rachel> hey, chandler, don't freak out! i'm telling you something you already know! come on, she broke up with richard because he didn't want to have babies. and she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's monica. 
<chandler> i don't see it that way. okay? because, i see two monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new monica, who i just started to date. now, who's to say what she wants?! im right. i'm right. am i right? 
<rachel> no, you're right, you are absolutely right. i mean that makes, that makes everything different. 
<chandler> okay. it's not different at all, is it? 
<rachel> not unless different means the same. 
< 
<s> you were so funny with that waiter! you're such a nut!  
<joey>  y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny. 
<s> no, you make them funny. you're the funny one!  
<joey> uhh, look katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. okay? umm, look i like you. i-i really do, i like you a lot. okay? but sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat. 
<s> aww, like i could hurt you. are you making fun of my size? don't make fun of me because of my size!  
< 
<monica> isn't this great? 
<chandler> hmm. 
<monica> couldn't you just stay like this forever?  chandler! couldn't you just stay here forever? 
<chandler> yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.  
<monica> are you okay? 
<chandler> yeah, i'm cool. casual. 
<monica> what-what are you doing? 
<chandler> i'm just hanging out. y'know, having fun. y'know with the girl that i'm seeing casually. 
<monica> man, i knew it! i knew you were going to do this!!

<chandler> well, you do want all that stuff, right? 
<monica> oh and you know what i want! 
<chandler> yes! you want babies! you have baby fever! 
<monica> i do not have baby fever! 
<chandler> oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! i've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?! 
<monica> have you lost your mind? chandler, this isn't about me! this is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap! 
<chandler> nah-uh! i know you! okay? i know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head! 
<monica> you don't know everything. did you know that i'm going out with rachel tonight instead of you? hmm? and did you know that the only baby around here is you?! and did you know that i can't even look at you right now?!  
<chandler> well, i did not know that. commercial break 
< 
<chandler> it's gonna be okay, right? i mean she's not gonna leave me? this is, this is fixable. 
<chandler> by me? 
<ross> oh, no! 
<joey> no-no. 
<ross> well, unless you make some kind of big gesture. 
<joey> yeah, big!  
<joey> uh-oh, shht! the misses. 
<monica> gunther, can i get a coffee  to go? 
<chandler> monica.  
<monica> i'm still not done not wanting to talk to you. 
<chandler> just tell me what i need to do to make things right. 
<monica> what?! 
<chandler> well, that's what we do. y'know, i-i mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then i do and then y'know you think i'm all cute again. 
<monica> really? i'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. you're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. all right? y'know what? if you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.

< 
<phoebe> obviously i didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. i just thought if i kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero. 
<ross> oh wow, yeah! see, i did not get that. 
< 
<chandler> where's monica?! where is she? i need to talk to her! it's urgent! is she here?

<monica> wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?! 
<chandler>  monica 
<monica> no-no, don't-don't-don't do it! 
<chandler> will you marry me?  
<ross> oh-no. no. no. 
<joey> what a bad idea! 
<rachel> ohhhh, i cannot look at it!  
<monica> chandler, why are you doing this? 
<chandler> i don't know. but i know i'm not afraid to do this. 
<monica> chandler. 
<chandler> i'm doing this because i'm sorry? 
<monica> do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry? 
<chandler> no, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married.  will you be my wife? 
<monica>  chandler, umm, i want you to take just a minute and i want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds. 
<chandler> yeah, i'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now. 
<monica> honey! do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! i mean i never said i wanted to have babies and get married right now! 
<chandler> yeah i know, but i was really confused and then i talked to these guys.  
<monica> who? two divorces and joey?! 
<ross> hey! 
<joey> she's right y'know. 
<ross> yeah, but still, cheap shot! 
<monica> y'know what? y'know when i said that i want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? well, you're not ready for that. 
<chandler> i didn't think i was!  
<monica> oh my god, what would have done if i said yes? 
<chandler> well i would've been happy because i would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that i love. or, you would've seen a chandler shaped hole in that door.  ending credits

<phoebe> aw, and i was gonna ask you to marry me because i forgot to say hello to you last week. 
<rachel> oh no wait pheebs, i think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. but i'm not sure, chandler? 
<chandler> okay, how long is this going to go on. 
<monica> well i think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time. 
<ross> this is fun. hey rach, remember that whole "we were on a break thing?" well, i'm sorry, will you marry me?  
<chandler> that's not funny. 
<joey> that's not funny at all!

<monica> wow! 
<chandler> oh that's so cool! why would a cop come in here though? they don't serve donuts.  y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? i think i can come up with something better than that. 
<rachel> phoebe, i bet somebody's missing that badge. 
<phoebe> yeah, i should probably take it back. ooh, but you know what? while i'm at the police station, i could check their ten most wanted lists because my friend fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!

< 
<phoebe> so this guy was all  and i'm all, buffay, homicide.  it was just so cool! 
<monica>  phoebe, you were supposed to take that back! 
<phoebe> i know but i'm having so much fun doing good deeds. 
<chandler> okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. you could get arrested. 
<phoebe> you could get arrested, right now!  all right, yeah, i gotta take it back. i'm totally drunk with power.  
<phoebe>  hey. 
<joey>  hey!  oh. 
<chandler> hi, joe. 
<joey> yeah, i didnt know you guys were going to be here. 
<monica> hey joey, sweetie, taste this.  
<joey>  what?! why?! 
<monica> what is going on with you? 
<joey> nothing! 
<chandler> oh, come on! you've been acting strange all day! 
<joey> all right! there is something. i kinda had a dream,  but i don't want to talk about it.  
<chandler> whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if martin luther king had said that?  i kinda have a dream! i dont want to talk about it. 
<joey> well, it involved monica. 
<chandler> you had a dream about a girl that i am seeing?! oh, that is so cool!  i can't tell you how many times i've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing.  anyway we're talking about your dream.  i love you.  your dream?  
<joey> don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. i haven't dreamt about her like that since i found out about you two--ish. 
<monica> what was the dream about? 
<joey> well, okay. you were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. y'know like you guys were doing last night. so, that's it. i'm in love with monica and i'll be moving out. 
<monica> wait, joey! joey! that doesnt mean that-that you're in love with me! 
<joey> it-it doesnt? 
<monica> no! 
<chandler> no, it can mean anything. like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because i've become the apartment stud. 
<joey> that kinda sounds like your dream dude. 
<monica> or, it could mean that-that you saw chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too. 
<joey> in the dream i did enjoy the closeness. 
<monica> um-hmm. 
<chandler> joey, look, are you attracted to monica? right here, right now, are you attracted to her? 
<joey>  not really. 
<chandler> well there you have it! 
<monica> well sure! i'm just wearing sweats!  but that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend! 
<joey> no, i don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. y'know? i mean, yeah, i can get a girlfriend! yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have? 
<chandler> well y'know, monica and i were friends before we started dating. so maybe-maybe that's it? 
<joey> friends first? that's interesting. 
<monica> you become friends after? 
<joey> no, never done that either. 
<rachel>  hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure? 
<chandler> oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.  
<monica>  that's right.  
<rachel>  what's up joey? 
<joey>  how you doin'?  commercial break 
< 
<phoebe> excuse me, is this your car? 
<s> yeah. 
<phoebe> well i don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance. 
<s> don't worry about it. it's not a problem. 
<phoebe> well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause i'm a cop.  
<s>  so am i! 
<phoebe> ohh, no.  oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause i know that 'cause i'm a cop too. so, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4.  
<s>  hey, wait a second! so wait, what precinct are you with? 
<phoebe> i-i'm with the umm, the 57th. 
<s> oh, i know a guy in homicide up there. 
<phoebe> i'm in vice. yeah, in fact i'm undercover right now. i'm a whore. 
<s> who-who else is in vice up there? 
<phoebe> umm, do you know, umm sipowicz? 
<s> sipowicz? no, i don't think so. 
<phoebe> yeah, big guy, kinda bald. 
<s> no, i don't know him. 
<phoebe>  dont try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. his umm, his partner just died. 
<s> wow umm, tell sipowicz i'm real sorry for his loss. 
<phoebe> i-i sure will, take care.  
<s>  hey by the way, i'm sure sipowicz is gonna be all right. i heard that kid from silver spoons is really good.  and where did you find my badge? 
<phoebe> oh.  
< 
<rachel> hey! joey, would you mind giving me and ross a hand moving his couch? 
<joey> oh, i'd love too, but i got acting class. but y'know what? i guess i can blow that off,  for you.  
<rachel> thanks! 
<joey> uh, hey, rach let me ask you something. uh, i was just over there talking to monica and chandler, boy they are really tight. 
<rachel> i know. 
<joey> yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. i'm thinking of getting me one of those. 
<rachel> what's up joe? 
<joey> well, the reason i think monica and chandler are so great 
<rachel> yeah? 
<joey> is because they were friends first. y'know? so i asked myself, "who are my friends?" you and phoebe, and i saw you first. so 
<rachel>  what are you saying? 
<joey> i'm saying maybe you and i crank it up a notch. 
<rachel> y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as i am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, i just, i-i don't think we should be cranking anything up. 
<joey> i'll treat you real nice.  
<rachel>  yeah, well, y'know umm no honey, listen i think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but i think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. don't hit on your existing friends! 
<joey> won't-won't that take longer? 
<rachel> yeah. yeah. oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait. 
<joey> yeah. i understand. i understand.  man, i wish i saw phoebe first! 
< 
<ross> come here to me. no-no, you come here to me. 
<rachel>  hey ross! i brought reinforcements. 
<ross> oh great! what, you brought joey? 
<rachel> well, i brought the next best thing. 
<chandler>  hey! 
<ross> chandler?! you brought chandler?! the next best thing would be monica! 
<chandler> y'know, i would be offended, but monica is freakishly strong, so 
<ross> look, i-i drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it.  okay rach,  that's you. that's the couch.  
<rachel> whoa-oh, what's-what's that?  
<ross> oh, that's me. 
<rachel> wow! you certainly think a lot of yourself. 
<ross> no! that's-that's my arm! 
<chandler>  oh, i see. i thought you just really, really liked your new couch. 
<ross> y'know what? just-just follow my lead.  
<rachel> okay! 
<chandler> okay. 
<ross> come on, chandler.  
<ross> all right.  okay, here we go!  
<ross> all right, ready? 
<chandler> yeah. 
<ross> turn. 
<chandler>  okay. 
<ross> turn! turn!  
<chandler> okay, i don't think we can turn anymore! 
<rachel> ross, i don't, i just don't think it's going to fit. 
<ross> oh yeah it will! come on, up! up-up-up! up! yes! here we go! pivot!  pivot! piv-ot! piv-et!! piv-ett!!! piv-et! 
<chandler> shut up! shut up! shut up!!  
<ross> okay, i don't think it's going to pivot anymore. 
<ross> all right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.  
<chandler> okay, yeah, i think it's really stuck now. 
<ross> i can't believe that didn't work! 
<rachel> i know, me neither! i mean, you had a sketch! 
<chandler> oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot? 
< 
<joey>  hey! 
<rachel> hey! how's it going? did you make any new friends? 
<joey> yeah, yeah, i met this woman.  
<chandler>  hey, whoa-whoa! what's she like? 
<joey> uhh, well, she's really good in bed. 
<monica> joey, i thought you were gonna try to be friends first! 
<joey>  well look, hey, it's all your fault! 
<rachel> what?! why?! 
<joey> well because you didn't give me advice! no! you gave me a pickup line! as soon as i told her i wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. i suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her!  and her roommate! 
<monica> what about the closeness? 
<joey> closeness-shmoshness! there was three of us for crying out loud! 
< 
<joey>  all right! hey, who wants pizza?! 
<chandler> ooh, i do! i do! i do!  
<joey>  oh, great! can you believe i found it on the second floor?

<phoebe> ooh, god, it's him! it's that cop! god, i can't believe it! he found me! 
<rachel> oh my god, phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?! 
<phoebe> well, if i'm going down, i'm taking you  with me.  harboring a fugitive? that's one to three years minimum. good luck chandler.  okay, you can arrest me. fine. but you'll never make it stick and you know it! 
<s> yeah, but i kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. i mean, you understand right? 
<phoebe> yep! as long as you understand that i'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. a fool! 
<s> i don't like looking foolish. y'know what? maybe uh, i don't arrest you today. maybe i came by and you weren't here. 
<phoebe> i would love it if i weren't here! 
<s> okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight i was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me? 
<phoebe> me?! 
<s> yeah. ever since you flashed my badge at me, i kinda can't stop thinking about you. you're the prettiest, fake undercover whore i've ever seen. 
<phoebe> wow! i didn't see that coming! you're-you're asking me out! 
<s> yeah. i mean, i coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me.

<ross> i don't, i don't think we've meet. i-i'm ross. 
<ross> nevermind!  mean you had just moved in. 
<ross> i had just moved in. thank you! listen umm 
<ross> jen, i know this may sound a little  but uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or 
<s> sure! that would be nice. 
<ross> umm? 
<s> oh! my number is on there.  give me a call. 
<ross> i will give you a call. 
<s> i'll see you later.  
<ross> okay!  
<s> i forgot my paper.  
< 
<chandler> that was amazing! 
<monica> phoebe and gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner. 
<chandler> that was amazing. 
<monica> we are the hottest! huh? no one is hotter than we are! you're the best. 
<chandler> no, you're the best. 
<monica> no, you're the best. 
<chandler> no, you're the best. 
<monica> i am the best.  
<joey>  hey guys!  what 'cha been doin'?  
<monica>  hey joey! isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day? 
<joey> i don't know. but i can see through your sheet.  yeah, yeah, that's her. but y'know what? doesn't matter, i'm never gonna get to meet her anyway. 
<monica> why? 
<joey> because it's impossible to find her apartment! she lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something. 
<monica> what are you talking about?  she obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left! 
<joey> no. no. no. she lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left. 
<monica> no, those first two windows,  that's the lobby. and y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. you've been counting wrong. 
<joey> i did not know that! thank you monica.  i can't believe i almost lost another girl because of counting. 
< 
<ross> so uhh, you ready? 
<s> sure, i'll just get my coat.  could you get that? 
<ross> sure.  joey 
<joey> dahhhhh!!  no! noooo!!  
< 
<rachel> ah, first, i-i would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again. meeting is being videotaped. 
<rachel>  okay. umm, well, first i would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you. 
<rachel> now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah,  who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and i think that's a big mistake and here's why. i made a huge fool of myself and i came back, that shows courage. when i thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, i said no. that shows integrity. and, i was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage.  okay umm, now i know i already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. and umm, and finally when i thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, i said no and i was not litigious. {by the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.  so she didn't want to sue him. don't worry, i had to look it up too.} so there you go, you got, you got  courage, you got integrity, you got  courage again, and not litigious. look mr 
<rachel> zelner! right! i knew that! i really, really want this job and i think, i think i would be really good at it. 
<rachel>  oh! you are? 
<rachel> really? oh thank you! oh oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug? 
<rachel> okay, well then how about a handshake?  oh god i'm sorry! oh god, i'm sorry! i did not mean to touch thati mean you there. there. uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, i'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you sohey! i'll see you monday!  
< 
<phoebe> you tired chandler? 
<monica> you better believe he's tired, after the day we had! if you know what i mean. you know what i mean? 
<chandler> honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean. 
<s> so uh chandler, you like that badge i got you? 
<chandler> oh yeah, it's so cool.  now i gotta go, officer bing has gotta, 10-100.  that's pee-pee.  
<monica> phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair. 
<phoebe> ohh,  umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here. 
<s> yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so 
<monica> you didn't! 
<phoebe> we did! we violated section 12 paragraph 7 of the criminal code! 
<monica> the park huh? a public place. 
<s> uh-huh. 
<monica> i hear ya. excuse me for just a second!   
<monica> hi chandler. 
<chandler> monica! this is the men's room!  isn't it? 
<monica> yes it is. you see i've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. haven't you? 
<chandler> no. and if i did, i don't think we'd be going out. monica, this is getting ridiculous! 
<monica> come on, we can't let them win! 
<chandler> ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! okay? so why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?! 
<monica> because phoebe and gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase! 
<chandler>  so? 
<monica> i feel really sad that we're not really there anymore. 
<chandler> oh wow! is that what this all have been about? 
<monica> wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time? 
<chandler> yeah that was great. that was really great! but to tell you the truth, i'm more excited about where we are right now. 
<monica> really? 
<chandler> yeah! i've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, i think that's pretty incredible. and the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah i think that's pretty exciting.  
<monica> that is so sweet. i know that i was acting a little crazy but umm, i feel the same way. 
<chandler> yeah? 
<monica> yeah.  
<chandler> y'know what i just realized? you just freaked out about our relationship. 
<monica> did not. 
<chandler> yes you did! admit it! you freaked out! 
<monica> okay, i freaked out a little. 
<chandler> little?! you freaked out big time! okay? and i fixed it! we have switched places! i am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up!  and now we're back. ending credits 
<  
<rachel>  i cannot believe ross is buying this! 
<monica> thank god! i can't watch him anymore! 
<chandler>  you guys ready fore the movies? 
<rachel> yeah! oh by the way, thank you for loaning us pamela and yasmine.  
<ross>  man! they cannot get enough! (makes like he's a robot 
< 
<joey> okay, pick a card. 
<chandler> okay.  
<joey> all right now, memorize it.  you got it? 
<chandler> oh yes. 
<joey>  is that your card?  
<chandler>  yes.  
<s>  hey guys! 
<ross> hi! 
<chandler> hi there! 
<s> hi!! 
<s> guess what? ben is going to be in a tv commercial! 
<phoebe> what are you talking about?! 
<ross>  well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning. 
<joey>  whoa! this guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town!  ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!!  i mean, way to go ben!  man! i've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition. 
<ross> i know, it's crazy! we were just pushing ben on the swings 
<joey> i'm always on the swings! what am i doing wrong?! 
<chandler> that. opening credits 
< 
<rachel>  okay, gotta go! wish me luck! 
<joey> luck! 
<chandler> hey rach, now that you're working at ralph lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts? 
<rachel> uh well, y'know what? i don't think if i feel comfortable stealing on my very first day 
<chandler> unwilling to steal from work, interesting. 
<monica> besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me. 
<rachel> okay guys, way to wish me luck! 
<s> good luck! go get 'em!  
<phoebe> okay, let's discuss rachel's birthday. i say we throw a surprise party this weekend. 
<joey> whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month. 
<phoebe> yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise. 
<monica> i think it's a great idea. yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends. 
<joey> ross!! we're having a surprise party for rachel!! 
<ross>  okay!! 
<joey> done. 
<phoebe> okay, great so do you want to do it together? 
<monica> i would love to do it together!  
<joey> they're gonna do it together. 
<chandler> dude! that's my girlfriend! 
<joey> what, so i gotta shut it down now? 
<ross> all right, i gotta take off. i'm picking up ben then we're off to the big audition. 
<monica> it's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be ben's dad. 
<ross> yeah. 
<chandler> weirder than watching his two moms make out?  
<joey> whoa-whoa dad? there's a dad in the commercial? 
<ross> yeah the dad and ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it. 
<joey> whoa, hey, maybe i'll go down there with ya and see if i can get an audition to play the dad. i mean who better to play ben's father than his godfather. 
<ross> you're not his godfather. 
<joey> what?! are you kidding?! 
<ross>  of course i am!  okay, let's go godfather. 
<joey> all right!  
< 
<joey> hey! i'm in, they're gonna let me audition! 
<ross> really? that's great! 
<joey> i know! i know! it turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so i steered clear of her 
<s>  hey, that kid looks familiar. 
<joey> oh yeah, yeah! he's done tons of commercials. i've seen him in like sugar smacks, playstation, and that one for the phone company. in fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. chandler was mad . 
<ross> yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. ben is way cuter than that kid. i mean look at him, look at you,  
<joey> that's great. listen, wouldn't it be great though if i got to play ben's dad? 
<ross> joey, you look nothing like ben. 
<joey> i look more like him than you do!  
<s> y'know, i don't really know you well enough for you to do that. 
< 
<s> so it's down to these two, nancy i know you like this one and i think i agree. rachel, what do you think? 
<rachel> well umm, that one is pretty but uh, i just, i just love this fabric  sorry. 
<s> oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then i take credit for them--i'm kidding. 
<s> she is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. okay, now i'm kidding! 
<rachel>  oh, what a fun office. 
<s> i don't know which one, but i do know i need a cigarette. so what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?  
<s>  rachel? do you smoke? 
<rachel> oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories  about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke. 
< 
<rachel> and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me! 
<monica> that doesn't seem fair. 
<rachel> i know! it's like i'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit! 
<chandler> yeah, it is the best. 
<rachel> i mean what if this keeps happening? y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and i'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? and then when the day comes when kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? me or smokey smokerson? 
<monica> rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. just say you wanna get some fresh air. 
<rachel> yeah, i can do that. 
<chandler> yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke. 
<phoebe>  hey! 
<monica> hey! 
<phoebe> hey rach, you wanna get some coffee? 
<rachel> i would love to! 
<phoebe> oh good! 
<chandler> yeah, i wanna go to babe. 
<phoebe> oh good.  
<phoebe> oh wait, i change my mind!  okay, let's talk about the party! i have so many ideas!  
<monica> yeah, me too!  
<phoebe> oh, look at that. 
<monica> all right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what i thought we would start out with tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my cds! i've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food. 
<phoebe> what happened to the intimate dinner party? 
<monica> oh, we're not doing that. okay 
<phoebe> so wow, it looks like you took care of everything. thanks a lot, co-host. 
<monica> what?! i didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do! 
<phoebe> like what? 
<monica>  cups. 
<phoebe> cups? you're giving me cups? 
<monica> and ice! 
<phoebe> cups and ice? ooh, i get to be in charge of cups and ice?  all right. fine, okay, i will be in charge of cups and ice! 
<monica> wait a minute, i can get ice at the restaurant 
<phoebe> i got it! mine! 
<ross>  hi. 
<monica> hey! how'd the audition go?! 
<ross> not so good. 
<monica> wait a minute, are you doing joey's  "audition didn't go so well.  yeah it did?" 
<ross>  yeah i am! yeah, ben got a second audition! 
<joey>  yeah, i had to teach ross my bit because i actually didn't get a callback. 
<monica> you got a callback too didn't you? 
<joey>  yeah i did! 
< 
<s> hey rachel, what are you doing out here? 
<rachel> oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so i just thought i would come out here and get some fresh air. 
<s> nancy and i were talking about the fall collection. 
<rachel> oh great! 
<s> so anyway we really  honey, we're just smoking all over you. 
<s> oh, sorry!

<rachel> excuse me, can i, can i bum one of those?  y'know what, actually  okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here? 
<s> i thought you didn't smoke. 
<rachel> oh, i thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? y'know what i mean, like dubbies? and i actually, i thought to myself, "wow, those guys are crazy!" but no, i actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time. 
<s> we get high. 
<rachel> oh, me too. 
<s> i'm kidding. 
<rachel>  oh, me too. 
< 
<ross> oh god, this is so nerve wracking! how-how do you do this?

<joey> who knows? ben, kyle, and joey. the rest of you, thank you very much. 
<ross> yes!! i knew it!!  bye-bye! so long! later! 
<joey> oh this is great! i might actually get to play ben's dad! 
<ross> yeah! such different looks, we're putting you with raymond and kyle with ben. so it'll be either you two  or you two.  
<joey> man, this is gonna be kinda weird. 
<ross> yeah, it is. 
<s> yeah. it's gonna be weird. 
<ross> no, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird. 
<s> oh, oh, i thought we were just talking. commercial break

<phoebe>  hey! 
<phoebe> is it okay if i leave this stuff here 'til rachel's birthday party? 
<chandler> ah sure. what's in 'em? 
<phoebe> umm, cups. 
<chandler> oh good, because uh we got rachel 800 gallons of water. 
<ross> seriously that's a lot of cups. 
<phoebe> yeah well, that's 'cause monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice. 
<chandler> y'know i rued the day once didn't get a whole lot else done. 
<phoebe> okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  oh, hi joey!

<ross> what's up? 
<joey> well, i've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. so, i think i'm just gonna step aside. i'm gonna tell them that i won't audition. 
<ross> wow, uh, joey that's-that's great. thanks man. 
<joey> that's it? you're-you're gonna let me do this?! this-this is my career we're talking about here! 
<ross> well, you just

<ross> what?! 
<joey> what? chandler! tell 'em! 
<chandler>  well i mean, let me get the door first.  oh, hi! no one.  
<ross> why should ben step aside? it was his audition in the first place! you-you just tagged along! you're like the uh, tag-a-long dad. 
<joey> at least i care about his feelings! 
<ross> what?! 
<joey> do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesnt get it? 
<ross> and why wouldn't he get it? 
<joey> oh, come on! have you seen what my kid can do?! huh?! i mean he dials phones! he-he-he eats tortilla chips! he-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger! 
<ross> are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?

<joey> yeah? well look ross, you don't have to. okay? it's not your fault i suck. i mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "hmm, noodle soup."  
<ross> yeah y'know what? maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson. 
<joey> what you do mean? 
<ross> i think, sub-consciously 
<joey> wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me. 
<ross>  i think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that ben would get the part. 
<joey> well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine.  yeah. yeah! it's not that i'm a bad actor 
<ross> no! 
<joey> no, it's just ah, i care so damn much about little ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed. 
<ross> there you go. thank you!

<ross>  i'm good. opening credits 
< 
<rachel> i am so proud of joey, i can't believe he's going to be on law & order! 
<phoebe> i know. but don't you think that it should be called order and law? 
<rachel> no because first they arrest the guy and then they try him. 
<phoebe> don't get me started on that.  
<chandler> i was not flirting. 
<ross> and on your anniversary, for shame! 
<rachel> what's going on? 
<ross> chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl! 
<chandler> i was not and oh god, shh! 
<ross> well i'm sorry but you were! okay? and besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it. 
<phoebe> sounds like somebody wants to be mr. pizza delivery girl. 
<ross> well 
<chandler> is that what this is about? you like caitlin?

<rachel> okay, y'know what? we don't need her measurements. 
<phoebe>  okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay ross, i know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! she forgot my vegetarian! 
<ross> this is perfect! she'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, i'll turn on the charm-o-ross. oh i'm so glad you don't eat meat. 
<phoebe> see? vegetarianism benefits everyone.

<monica> that was some hot love you gave me! i'm gonna go get ready.

<phoebe> these are her earrings. 
<rachel> nooo! nooooo! you lent me monica's earrings?! i'm not allowed to borrow her stuff! 
<phoebe> why not? 
<rachel> because i lose her stuff! rest of the episode takes place in monica and rachel's apartment. why are they called apartments when they're all stuck together? something to think about.] 
<joey> okay, see that blind guy right there? i'm gonna bash his head in later.  
<joey> oh umm, my big scene is coming up. big scene coming up.

<s> what?! 
<ross>  the uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and i'm just saying i like it. the hair. 
<s> oh. thanks.

<chandler> you're welcome. 
<ross> you couldn't let me have her, could ya?! 
<chandler> what? 
<ross> this is a girl that i really like and had too swoop in there! 
<monica> what's goin' on? 
<ross> chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl! 
<chandler> thank you for that!  i was not flirting. 
<monica> it's okay. i don't care. it's uh, it's fine. 
<ross> really?! 
<chandler> really?! 
<monica> it's no big deal, i do it all the time. 
<chandler>  so umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time? 
<monica> sure! it doesn't mean anything! just like i know it doesn't mean anything with you! 
<chandler> okay, but there is a big difference. you are a lot hotter than i am. 
<joey>  true story!  
<monica> chandler, this actually bothers you? 
<chandler> yes, it does bother me! and i think it would bother a lot of people. rachel, when you were going out with ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women? 
<rachel> uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women. 
<ross> and thank you, for that. 
<rachel> but y'know, i never really had anything to worry about. ross was never very good at the flirting thing. 
<ross> what?  what-what, what are talking about? it-it worked with you. 
<rachel> oh! y'know what? you're right! we meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me! 
<ross> all right, all right. you-you-you know what i'm going to do? i am going to order another pizza and when caitlin gets here, you-you--i will show how well i flirt. yeah! i will, i will get her phone number!  and not the one on the menu! 
<phoebe>  i found it! 
<rachel> ohh! thank god! where was it? 
<phoebe> on your dresser. 
<rachel> okay that is the one we already have! 
<joey> okay, here's my big scene. my big scene's here!  oh my god. 
<monica> what? 
<joey>  okay, everybody just keep smiling. it'll kill my grandmother if she finds out. 
<chandler>  well, what is it? 
<joey>  oh, they cut me out of the show. 
<rachel>  what?! 
<ross>  are you sure? 
<phoebe>  maybe your scene's coming up? 
<joey>  not likely.  'cause you see that body bag right there 
<rachel>  yeah. 
<joey>  i'm in it. commercial break 
< 
<phoebe>  this is terrible, what are you going to do? 
<joey>  i don't know. this little, old lady lives for my career. when they dumped me off of days of our lives she almost died. 
<phoebe>  that's not good. 
<joey>  no, smile! not that face, smile! everybody smile!  
<rachel>  joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? it's not your fault. 
<chandler>  if we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon? 
<joey> soon, soon, i'm gonna be on soon. there i am!  
<joey> no-no-no, that-that's me, that's me. capricorn one. 
<chandler> doesn't know, "hello." but she knows capricorn one.  
<monica>  phoebe! i have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over. 
<phoebe> but i already gave them back to you! 
<monica> no you didn't. 
<phoebe> all right, i already didn't give them back to you, that's what i said.  where is that other earring? 
<rachel> it's not here pheebs, it's not here. ohh, i went to joey and chandler's last night! okay!  
<phoebe> make sure you check chandler's jewelry box. 
<rachel> wait a minute. chandler has a jewelry box? 
<phoebe> okay, we have like ten minutes. do you want me to get into that now?!  
<ross>  hey pheebs! how's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? you and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh? 
<phoebe>  why are you being weird? 
<ross> do you like it? 
<phoebe> no, that would be, "why are you being cute?" 
<ross> okay, i'm working on my flirting. 
<phoebe> ohh! i did not get that.  
<chandler> so uh monica, do you, do you like the law & order? 
<monica> yeah, it's good. 
<chandler> see, i'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the law & order and that you flirted with every guy in the tri-state area! 
<monica> chandler!  okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me. 
<chandler> oh, i'm so glad we cleared that up. look, i'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women. 
<monica> go on, teach me something about men and women. 
<chandler> okay, i've already taught you so much already, but whatever. see when you flirt with a guy you think, "i'm just flirting, no big deal." but the guy is thinking, "finally! somebody who wants to sleep with me!" 
<monica> no way! 
<chandler> it's true. 
<monica> well that's pathetic! 
<chandler> again true. 
<monica> and this goes for all guys? 
<chandler> all guys that are awake. then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way. 
<joey>  all right, it's another commercial; i still haven't told her! 
<ross> joey! this is like the last commercial. you've got like  ten minutes left! 
<joey> i know, i know! what am i going to do?  ooh! 
<monica> no! you are not gonna run out and leave her here! 
<joey>  yeah, all right.  ooh!  
<chandler> uh, joey is gonna be right back. right back!  meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you.  so, you're old and small. 
<rachel>  hey!

<monica> i'm his sister, okay? i love him! i don't want to see him get hurt! come on! doesnt that give me the right to control himhelp him? 
<rachel> i don't think he's the one who needs help.  
<monica> no, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? i mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day.  okay, fine! but i mean, look at the position she's putting him in! what's he gonna do? ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! i mean, who would do that?!  okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! although it did involve a lot of the same people. 
<rachel> ugh! 
<monica> y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.

<monica> all right, i guess we should go. 
<rachel> no, wait. wait. 
<monica> oh yeah right!  
<rachel> no, monica! monica! we have to fix this! 
<monica> there's nothing we can do. you erased the message! 
<rachel> yeah well unless we tell him. 
<monica> well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, i can't argue with you! all right? fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. i just don't want to be a part of it.  
<rachel> oh, maybe that's emily calling back to leave the exact same message. 
<ross>  hey ross! it's you! i just want you to remember this feeling. you are lucky to be alive! so live everyday to the fullest. love yourself, okay? okay. oh, and also get stamps. bye!  
<monica> wow! play that message for emily and this whole problem goes away! 
<rachel> right?

<s> hey, anybody want to meet a hero? 
<phoebe>  john glenn is here?! 
<s> no, joey! 
<ross> pheebs, we had the most incredible night! okay, so, we're in the car 
<s> wait! hold on!  hi! 
<phoebe> hi! 
<s>  okay, go ahead. 
<ross> okay, okay, so we're in the car. right? and bang! a shot was fired. and joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me! 
<phoebe> my god, joey! 
<chandler>  it was a car backfire! 
<ross> yeah, but-but he didn't know that! 
<joey> yeah, i didn't know that. 
<ross> and it could've just as easily have been a bullet. 
<s> hey joe, you ever think about joining the force? we could use a guy like you. 
<chandler> who jumps at loud noises! 
<ross> wow! i could've died tonight. 
<chandler> yeah! if the car that backfired had run over you! y'know what, i think i'll go home before ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.  
<ross> i do have a newfound respect for life. 
<chandler>  oh my god!  
<s>  so you wanna get some dinner? 
<phoebe> yeah! sure! yep!  oh, y'know what? if i heard a shot right now, i'd throw my body on you. 
<s> oh yeah? well maybe you and i should take a walk through a bad neighborhood. 
<phoebe> okay! 
<s> all right. 
<phoebe> bye!  
<joey> cut it out ross! i hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day! 
< 
<joey> dude! how come you took off? 
<chandler> oh, i just went for a walk, around the living room. whatever 
<joey> is something wrong? 
<chandler> no. no i'm just tired. y'know, from-from the walk. 
<joey> okay. 
<chandler> you dove in front of ross! ross! 
<joey> that's what this is about! oh my god, you hate ross! 
<chandler> i do not hate ross! 
<joey> of course you do! i saved him! you're mad at me! it all adds up! you want ross out of the picture. 
<chandler> what picture? 
<joey> i don't know, but i don't like what i'm hearing! 
<chandler> look i'm very glad that you saved ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me! 
<joey> ohh, you're upset because you think i chose ross over you! no! i knew you could take care of yourself. y'know, i mean ross, he need help. he's not street like us! 
<chandler> when it comes down to it, you would risk your life for ross before you would for me. that's the bottom line. 
<joey> well, no, not exactly! all right, look, i, i wasn't trying to save ross. okay? my sandwich was next to ross. all right? i was, i was trying to save my sandwich. 
<chandler> from a bullet! 
<joey> i know it doesn't make much sense 
<chandler> much sense?! 
<joey> look chandler, it was instinct! okay? i just went for it! 
<chandler> so you risked your life, for a sandwich! 
<joey> i know it sounds crazy, but chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world! 
<chandler> so you didn't uh, choose ross before me. 
<joey> no! i would never do that! you-you're like my brother! 
<chandler> really?! 
<joey> yeah! in fact, to prove how much you mean to me,  here. 
<chandler> thanks.  
<joey> no, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!  
<joey> how good is that? 
<chandler>  oh-oi-ho, yeah! 
<joey> see? 
<chandler> hm-hmm.  
<joey> oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?! 
<chandler> i thought you were showing me how much you mean to me. 
<joey> yeah. with a bite!  gee-e-e-eez! 
< 
<rachel> hey! hi! 
<ross> rach, what uh, what are you doing here? 
<rachel> hey! y'know what? you are in our apartment all the time! okay? this is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister! 
<ross> y'know, it-it doesn't matter. the important thing is that you're here. you're my friend, and you're here. oh!  
<rachel> okay, just a little scared. what's going on ross? 
<ross> the most amazing thing happened tonight. i thought my number was up. i had an actual near death experience! 
<rachel> what?! what? what happened?! 
<ross> okay, okay, we were on the ride along with gary, right? 
<rachel> yeah! 
<ross> and somebody took a shot at me! 
<rachel>  really?! 
<ross> no, a car backfired, but  i thought somebody was taking a shot at me. and rach, i i survived! and i was filled with this-this great respect for life. y'know? i-i want to experience every moment. i want to seize every opportunity. i-i am seeing everything so-so clearly now. 
<rachel> because a car backfired? 
<ross>  okay, why are you here? 
<rachel> well, i-i-i don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, emily called you today. 
<ross> you talked to her? 
<rachel> no, she left a message.  but it-it kinda got erased. there's just  something wrong with your machine. 
<ross> well, okay, what-what did she say? 
<rachel> well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her. 
<ross> wow! 
<rachel> now, that-that was a good thing that i told you, right? 
<ross> huh? yeah! yes, of course! 
<rachel> okay. thank you! thank you! becausei'm sorry, all right. because y'know what? she didn't want menot important. the point is, i was right. your decision. okay? i was right.  your decision. 
<ross> right. i guess, i guess i should call emily. 
<rachel> okay, no, that's not the right decision. that's not, that's not right, no ross-ross, come on! i mean, that woman made you miserable! okay, ross, do you really want to get back into that? 
<ross> okay, look, yesterday i would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day i have a near death experience. i mean, that-that has got to mean something! 
<rachel> ugh, ross! that was not a near death experience! that was barely an experience! 
<ross> you weren't there! okay, maybe this is something that i-i'm supposed to seize! y'know? 
<rachel> okay, y'know what? maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. maybe this is about escaping stuff. 
<ross> huh. 
<rachel> i mean, look-look today you escaped  death, y'know? and maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with emily? 
<ross> that does make sense. because i do wanna seize some opportunity, but i-i really don't wanna see or talk to her. 
<rachel> well, there you go! 
<ross> yeah. maybe today is just, close call day. 
<rachel>  close call day. 
<ross> hey, thanks rach.  
<rachel> ohh, honey no problem. okay.  
<ross> oh wait-wait-wait! the message is blinking. maybe you didn't erase it. 
<rachel> oh?  
<ross>  "hey ross, it's you!"  oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that. 
<rachel> no.  
<ross>  hey umm, was-was monica here? 
<rachel> yeah. 
<ross> yeah, i want my money back. 
<rachel>  yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?  ending credits 
< 
<ross> hey pheebs, has gary ever been shot at for real? 
<phoebe> yes. once. yeah, a little. he kinda did it to himself. it's not really a good story. 
<ross> i wonder how i would react under fire, y'know? and not backfire but-but heavy fire, like i was in a war or something. 
<monica> man, i would be great in a war! i mean, i really, i think i would make a fantastic military leader. i mean i know i would make general way before any of you guys. 
<chandler> before or after you were shot by your own troops? 
<ross> i know where joey would be. he would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us. 
<chandler> yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches. 
<joey> yeah, hero sandwiches.  
<phoebe> well you all know that i'm a pacifist so i'm not interested in war in any way.  but y'know what? when the revolution comes, i will have to destroy you all.  not you joey.  
< 
<s>  would you like some more coffee, baby-doll? 
<phoebe> i'm fine, thanks. 
<chandler>  yeah, see, i can't pull of baby-doll can i? 
<monica> no. i think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. i'm gonna get some tea. 
<chandler> okay.  
<chandler> hiya doin' pumpkin? 
<phoebe> nope.   
<monica> so it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh? 
<s> i know, really well. in fact, i'm gonna ask phoebe to move in with me. 
<monica>  oh my god! 
<s> what do you, what do you think? 
<monica> i think that is so great! when are you gonna ask her? 
<s> tonight, but don't say anything. okay? 
<monica> i swear, i promise. i promise. oh my god, i'm so excited! {and i just can't hide it! i'm about to lose control and i think i like it! sorry, just couldn't resist it.} all right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. okay? because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral 
<s>  i'll see you after work sweetie.  
<phoebe> okay. bye!  
<phoebe> so, what movie should we see? 
<monica>  gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!! 
<phoebe> what?! really?! 
<monica> he just told me at the counter. he made me promise not to tell, but i couldn't hold it in any longer! 
<phoebe> i can't believe this! 
<chandler>  right, because it's fast. because, it's so fast. it's fast! 
<monica> relax! it's phoebe! not you! 
<chandler> oh! good for you pheebs, way to go!  
<phoebe> no, but it is fast. isn't it? 
<monica> ohhhh! 
<phoebe> no, i like him a lot but i don't think i'm ready for this! 
<chandler> so, what are you gonna do? 
<phoebe> i don't know. i'll just handle iti'll ask you to talk to him! 
<chandler> me?! why me? 
<phoebe> because you are so afraid of commitment! you talk to him, make him scared like you! make him a man! 
<chandler> i'll try, but i'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? because i'm a lot less afraid of commitment than i used to be. 
<monica> that is so sweet!  
<chandler>  still terrified, i'll take care of it. no problem.  opening credits

<joey> hey ross, is uh, is staten island really an island? 
<ross> uh-huh, that's why they call it staten island. 
<joey> ohhh. i thought it was like long island. 
<ross>  also an island.  
<joey> hey, what time is it? 
<ross> . 
<joey> wow! you realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour? 
<ross> are you serious?! 
<joey> yeah. i realized it about a half-hour ago but i didn't want to say anything 'cause i didn't want to jinx it. 
<ross> wow! we are pretty good at this! hey! we totally forgot about lunch! 
<joey> oh, i-i, i think that's the first time i ever missed a meal!  yeah, my pants are a little loose! 
<rachel>  hey, you guys 
<joey> hey! 
<rachel> is monica here? 
<rachel> all right listen umm, i just bought something i'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that i wanted since i was a little girl. 
<ross> you bought shawn cassidy! 
<rachel> noo! i wish! okay, you ready? 
<rachel> okay!  check it out!  
<ross> what-what is it?! 
<joey> what the hell is that?!! 
<rachel> it's a, it's a cat! 
<joey> that, is not a cat! {i have to agree with joey on this one.} 
<rachel> yes it is! 
<ross> why is it inside out?! 
<rachel> excuse me! but this is a purebred, show-quality sphinx cat! 
<ross> how much did you pay for that? 
<rachel> well, it was a little extravagant, but i a pretty good deal. 
<ross> yeah? how much? 
<rachel> a thousand bucks. 
<ross> on a cat??!!!! 
<joey> it's not a cat! 
<rachel> all right listen ball boys! my grandmother had one of these when i was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! i mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and i would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it! 
<ross> free cats do that too, y'know. {which reminds me, if i might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. if you want a leash, go to the pet shop. if you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. now back to regularly scheduled programming.} 
<joey> it's not a cat! 
<rachel> ugh! look you guys, i'm really excited about this! okay? i don't care what you think! i'm gonna go set up a little litter box for mrs. whiskerson.  well, what am i gonna call her? fluffy?!  
<ross>  hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? huh? 
<joey> uhh, the ball thing. 
<ross> yeah? 
<joey> hey ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?! 
<ross> uhh, yeah it would! let's do it! 
<joey> okay!  
<joey>  uh-oh. 
<ross> what? 
<joey> i have to pee. and rachel's in the bathroom!  
<joey> man, i didn't think we were gonna make it! 
<ross> i know!  don't switch hands, okay? 
< 
<chandler> hey ladies! what are you in here for?  
<s> hey chandler, what are you doing here? 
<chandler> gary, i'm here to report a crime. 
<s> yeah? 
<chandler> it is a crime that you and i don't spend more time together. 
<s>  what's up? 
<chandler> well, i heard that you thinking about asking phoebe to move in with you and i thought maybe, we should have a talk. man to uh, me. 
<s> sure. okay. 
<chandler> uh, are you crazy? are you insane? if you live with phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together! 
<s> yeah, i-i considered that. i just know it would make me happy. 
<chandler> you mean scared. 
<s> no, i mean happy. 
<chandler> scared? happy? 
<s> chandler, what-what are you doing? 
<chandler> i am trying to open your eyes, my man! don't you see, if you lived with phoebe she's always gonna be there. you're gonna get home, she's there. you go to bed, she's there. you wake up and oh yes, she's there! 
<s> i know! i can't wait! 
<chandler> were you're parents happy, or something? 
<s> listen chandler, the way i see it is that i was lucky enough to find someone that i really love. i justi wanna be around her as much as i can. 
<chandler> wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary. 
<s> so you know what i'm talking about, right? 
<chandler> yeah, i think i do! y'know what? you move in with her! you move in with her right now! maybe i should in with monica! 
<s> no, it's too soon for you guys. 
<chandler>  yeah, you're right about that. 
< 
<ross> now when they found the remains of the mesozoic mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a paleozoic amphibian in its jaws! how did it get there?! {y'know, sometimes i think the script writers throw in a line like that to try to trip me up. but it won't work. i'll always have the last laugh! <manical_laugh.wav> okay, so maybe i'm a little deluded, it's probably just my spellchecker. but, i must admit i did get mesozoic and paleozoic on the first attempt. yay me! anyhoo } 
<joey> maybe this should be more of a quiet game. {oh, all right!  geez, i can't have any fun!} 
<monica>  hey guys! 
<joey> hi! 
<monica> joey, i left my watch on the counter last night.  it was right here, where is it? 
<joey> i don't know. 
<monica> all right, come on, i'm-i'm late for work! 
<ross> how do you know? you don't have a watch. 
<monica> guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it! 
<joey> oh, i don't know . yeah, can't do it.  
<monica> what?! 
<ross> monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball! 
<joey> yeah, we haven't dropped it in  
<ross> 2 hours, 27 minutes. 
<monica> really?! 
<monica>  i-i'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, i don't feel very good.  yes!!  wow! uh, for a second there i thought i was really better, but i'm not.   
<ross> hey rach! 
<rachel> hey. 
<ross> check it out! almost 3 hours without droppin' it! 
<rachel> oh, wow! congratulations, that's quite a waste of time. 
<monica> rach? 
<rachel> yeah? 
<monica> you have scratches all over you, what happened?  
<rachel> well, it's my cat. 
<monica>  what?! 
<rachel> oh yeah, i got a cat. 
<monica> i don't want a cat! 
<joey> oh, don't worry, it's not a cat. 
<ross> yeah. 
<rachel> you guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. i mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, i even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. and i swear, i know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me i know it's saying, "rachel!" 
<ross> doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat. 
<monica>  what?! you paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!! 
<rachel> well, i was gonna let you play with it. 
< 
<chandler> hi! 
<phoebe> hmm, did you talk to gary about the moving in thing? 
<chandler> yes i did, and i think you should do it. 
<phoebe> what?! 
<chandler> he's a great guy, y'know? and he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady. 
<phoebe> you are useless! freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! the one thing! and you can't even do that right! god! 
<chandler> im sorry.  if you ask me, i'd move in with him. 
<phoebe> ohh!! god!  ooh!  get out of here, good for nothing. 
<s> hey chandler.

<phoebe> thanks! okay.  
<s> here's the thing. 
<phoebe> yeah? 
<s> y'know i really want to move this relationship forward. 
<phoebe> uh-hmm. 
<s> because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards. 
<phoebe> no that's not true. if you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. and staying still is good. watch this.  
<s> phoebe? 
<phoebe> yeah? 
<s> i want you to move in with me. 
<phoebe> that is so sweet. but don't you think it's a little too soon? i mean there's so much we don't know about each other. 
<s>  oh. oh-oh-okay, i get it. 
<phoebe> i justi don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for. 
<s>  uh-huh. 
<phoebe> i really don't want to mess up what we have. i'm justi'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake. 
<s>  yeah. 
<phoebe> which is why my answer is yes! 
<s>  really?! 
<phoebe> uh-huh!  i'm so happy.  commercial break 
<

<chandler> all right, let me in.  
<monica>  no-no! don't do it! don't! 
<chandler> what? 
<monica> he's a dropper! 
<joey> oh yeah, that's right! 
<chandler> i'm not a dropper! 
<ross> it's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know? 
<chandler> it's throwing and catching! 
<ross> all right.  
<chandler> oh! oh! that's so hard.   
<joey> whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat! 
<monica> oh myoh good god! 
<rachel>  i give up you guys, i don't know what i'm going to do with this thing! 
<ross> baking it didn't help, huh? 
<monica> so, why don't you just take it back to where you got it? 
<rachel> i tried! they won't take her back. 
<chandler> maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-christ. 
<monica> rach, why won't they take it back? 
<rachel> well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. i mean, what am i going to do, get a thousand regular cats? 
<monica> look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it. 
<rachel> no mon that's not the point. i'm out a thousand dollars, i'm all scratched up, and i'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!   
<monica> oh my god, the cat's made my eyes water! don't-don't throw it to me! my vision's been compromised!!  oh god! okay. okay. it's okay. man, that was close.

<s> hey! 
<s> we have great news!

<s> congratulations! congrats! 
<phoebe> i know, i'm so excited!

<s> all right.  
<monica> so you're moving in with him. what happened? 
<phoebe> i couldn't tell him no. he got so sad. maybe it'll be all right. i do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money i'll save on stamps. 
<monica> why, do you write him a lot? 
<phoebe> no, i just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. don't they? 
<s> yeah! that's right. yeah-yeah! yeah!  
<phoebe> oh, i'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out. 
<

<phoebe>  are these for rent! i thought people were just bragging! 
<s> let me tell you what i think might be going on.  no-no-no, don't look at the table. look at me.  okay, i think somebody asked someone to move in with them. and i think someone said, "yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. does that sound at all possible to you? 
<phoebe> yes. yes! fine! i am someone! you want me to say it? i have doubts!  i'm sorry!  
<s> phoebe 
<phoebe> yeah? 
<s> phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. i mean it is soon. and there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and i just figure that everything i really like. and the things i don't know, i get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox. 
<phoebe> that's so sweet. 
<s> sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. it's fine! we don't have to move in together. i justi want you to be happy

<rachel> oh, terrific! that'll be $2,000.

<chandler> yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? do i need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?   
<chandler> what? 
<monica> i love you. {there's another continuity error here. before monica says i love you, chandler's holding the vests so that you couldn't see the collar, you could see all three, and they were folding nicely. after she says the line and the camera cuts back to chandler, you can only see two out of the three, you can see the collar of the top one, and it looks like it was folded sloppily, unlike before. hey, you notice things while spending this much time on this!} 
<joey> man, i wish ross was coming with us! y'know? i'm gonna miss him! 
<phoebe> thanks a lot! i just got that jerk out of my mind! 
<chandler> hey, so where are we staying? is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite? 
<joey> uh no, not really. it's an independent film y'know? so we don't have a real big budget. i figured i'd just stay in your room. 
<chandler> i see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? i mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot? 
<joey> oh yeah! for every dollar shutter speed makes, one penny of it goes right in joey's pocket. 
<chandler> so you don't get paid unless the movie makes money? 
<joey> did you not hear the plot of the movie? "she's been dead for ten years." i'm gonna be a millionaire! 
<ross>  hey! 
<joey> hey! 
<ross> i just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? twenty bucks on black 15. 
<joey> you got it! 
<ross> all right!  
<chandler> all right, bye-bye now! 
<phoebe> bye! 
<rachel> bye you guys! 
<joey> bye-bye! 
<monica> i wanna say good-bye at the car! 
<chandler> okay!

<phoebe> i don't know! i don't remember! 
<ross> well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this? 
<phoebe> oh no, i am mad at you. i know that much. but, i am sorry about the fat ass thing. you actually have a very sweet little hiney.  
< 
<joey> man, i'm getting pretty tired. you're might have to take over soon. 
<chandler> we've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once. 
<joey> don't worry, it's out there!  i think i just need lunch.

<joey> what are you talking about?! i'm the lead in a movie! 
<chandler> they're not even paying ya! this doesn't even sound like a real movie! 
<joey> y'know what? i don't need this! okay? i don't know why you're dumping all over my big break. 
<chandler> joe, i don't think this is going to be your big break. 
<joey> is that why you're on this trip, huh? make me feel like a loser? 'cause if it is, i'll tell ya, i-i-i'd rather be alone. 
<chandler> oh, you don't want me on the trip? 
<joey> not if you're gonna be like this! 
<chandler> all right, i'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that i'll lie. 
<joey> yeah! i don't want you on the trip! 
<chandler> all right, fine! fine! why don't you pull over? i'll get out right now! 
<joey> fine!  get out! 
<chandler> you're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge. 
<joey> get out!! 
<chandler> all right!!  wait! wait, there's no sidewalk! yeah, i'm gonna die here. commercial break

<ross> okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells? 
<phoebe> no. 
<ross> are you angry at me because i said your handwriting is childlike? 
<phoebe> no that made me feel precious.

<ross> hey! 
<chandler> joey kicked me out of the car on the george washington bridge! 
<s> why?! 
<chandler> i don't know! he went crazy! y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast. 
<phoebe> that game should not be played without my supervision. 
<chandler> well, i don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? all i said was that uh, i didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge. 
<phoebe> what's in the bag? 
<chandler> oh, i figured you guys would all be mad at me. so i got you some gifts that i found on the side of the road.  who wants the teddy bear with one leg?

<chandler> y'know, he won't even talk to me. how am i going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me? 
<monica> well, maybe you should send him something. so that when he gets to las vegas he'll know that you're sorry. 
<chandler> that's a good idea. i wonder where i could  get a basket of porn 
<phoebe> no, don't-don't say i'm sorry with porn! 
<chandler> really? 
<phoebe> y'know what you should send him? a cartoon of cigarettes. 'cause that why he could trade it for protection. no. that's prison.

<phoebe> that is so weird! i had a dream that you'd have lunch with richard. 
<monica> really? 
<phoebe> but again, simmons. go on. 
<monica> the strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but i didn't feel anything at all! 
<phoebe> ooh! so now why can't we tell chandler? 
<monica> because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. i just don't want anything to spoil that.

<joey> oh my god! thats huge!  wait a minute, why come i wasnt invited? and who was going to be your best man? dont say, "ross." do not say, "ross." 
<chandler> look, i just dont think monica and i are ready to get married yet! yknow? i mean, i love her and everything but seeing ross and rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that monica and i are moving so fast. yknow? and, how do i tell her without crushing her? 
<joey> oh! tell her shes not marriage material. 
<chandler> what?! 
<joey> girls say it to me all the time! and believe me, if shes anything like me, shes just gonna be relieved.  
<monica> how do i tell chandler that its too soon. its gonna break his heart, hes not gonna think that i dont love him anymore. 
<phoebe> well you dont. 
<monica> yes i do! 
<phoebe> good! good! i was just testing you.

<chandler> hey!  
<ross> what? 
<chandler> are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? or 
<rachel>  i dont know.  what do you mean last night? nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.

<rachel> oh my god. 
<ross> ithey would not let us get married when we were that drunk! 
<rachel> no! 
<joey> they let you get married when youre drunk! most people who get married in vegas are drunk! 
<phoebe> hell, im drunk right now!  what? i cant have a mimosa with breakfast?! im on vacation! 
<monica> what are you guys gonna do? 
<rachel> well, i guess we just find a divorce lawyer?  
<chandler> well, i think, i think, ross already has one. now, this ones free, right? because you paid for the first two, so the third ones free. 
<ross> laugh it up, but the jokes on you. because we dont need to get divorced, okay? we were just gonna get an annulment. 
<joey> an annulment? ross! i dont think surgerys the answer here. 
<phoebe> oh-oh, thats your thing. 
<ross> what? 
<phoebe> youre thing. youre thing. yknow? youre the guy who gets divorced. 
<s> oh yeah! 
<ross> no-no, thats-thats not my thing! i do not love getting divorced! 
<phoebe> yes you do! this is your third divorce! you love divorce so much youre probably gonna marry it! then it wont work out and youre gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy.  im so drunk. 
< 
<monica> so, what do you think we should do? 
<chandler> i dont know. but i-i-i know i love you! 
<monica> i know i love you!  
<chandler> so where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? i love you. 
<monica> thats a good question. look umm, last night we let the dice decide. maybe we should leave it up to fate again. i love you! 
<chandler> yes, we dont get married unless theres a sign! okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight  then theres a definite sign that we should get married. 
<monica> all right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we dont get married. 
<chandler> sounds great.

<monica>  come on eight. 
<chandler>  yes, yes eight.  
<s> eight! easy eight.  
<monica> wow! i cant believe i actually rolled an eight. 
<chandler> that was so unlikely. well, lets get married! i guess. 
<monica> wait a minute. that wasnt a hard eight! last night i rolled a hard eight. 
<chandler> thats right! it was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! damnit! 
<monica> i wanted it so bad!  wanna go pack? 
<chandler> yeah.  were doing the right thing, right? 
<monica> ohh, of course we are!  we left it up to fate.  if we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.  
< 
<phoebe> okay, you have 19 questions left. use them wisely.  come on joey! you cant win if you dont ask any  questions!!! 
<joey>  what?! 
<phoebe> well, you promised me a fun road trip! weve been on the road six hours and youve been asleep for five and a half! we are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! that will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!

<rachel> ohh, okay, im sorry. youre right. yknow what? we absolutely can stay married, because i was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. all right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what youre asking of me. 
<ross> im asking you to do me a favor. 
<s> does anyone else want to smack ross right about now? raise your hands. okay, put them down before you stink out the person next to you.} 
<rachel> you are asking me to be your wife!

<rachel>  no! ross, come on! no! listen, look i thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, ross, is we can not stay married. 
<ross> i dont know if its true. 
<rachel> oh b-b-but it is! 
<ross> oh, okay, yknow what this is? this is a difference of opinion. and when that happens in a marriage...

<ross> could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? all right? my life is an embarrassment! i should go live under somebodys stairs! 
<phoebe> ross, its not that big a deal! so youll been divorced three times, youll still have a life, youll go on dates 
<ross>  no! no, i wont! ill be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. the only guys below me will be four divorce guy uh, murderer guy, and-and, geologists. 
<phoebe> ross, youre being ridiculous! okay? you are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces! 
<ross> oh yeah? have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times? 
<phoebe> yknow thats really fair. yknow? most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. ross, nobody cares about this except you! this-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! here, ill show you! come here.

<rachel> ugh, the worse day! yknow, you think youre making progress at work and then your boss calls you raquel. 
<chandler> hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me sha-la-lap.  seriously. 
<rachel> i believe you. so, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me raquel! by the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me rocky! 
<chandler> well, i-i still think youre very-very nice and very pretty 
<rachel> what? 
<chandler>  all yours babe.

<monica>  well be waiting for you what theyre talking about. where the towels are hers and hers and his, threes company too! yeah, thats the theme song for threes company.} commercial break 
< 
<ross> once you know the stories, its not that bad. first marriage, wifes hidden sexuality, not my fault. second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. third marriage, well they really shouldnt allow you to get married when youre that drunk and have writing all over your face, nevadas fault. 
<phoebe> okay, so what do you think ladies? who wouldnt be interested? who wouldnt want to date him? 
<s> well the divorces dont bother me, id date him. but, not while hes still married. 
<phoebe> okay, what about you?  wouldnt you want a date? 
<s> actually, im dating at all anymore. see, i figured out that i was only dating guys that were like yknow bad for me, so until i work that out 
<phoebe>  whatever! what about you meg? 
<s> well, i dont care about the divorces either, but i wouldnt date him. its just that hes obviously still in love with this rachel girl. 
<ross> what?! 
<phoebe>  she said, "hes obviously still in love with this rachel girl."  
<ross> this is crazy! i mean, yes-yes rachel is my good friend and i-i have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! phoebe, will you-will you help me out here? 
<phoebe> well, i thought you loved her when you-when you married her. 
<ross> we were drunk! i wouldve married uh, joey with that amount of alcohol! 
<phoebe> hey! you could do a lot worse than joey tribbiani!! 
<ross>  look, im sorry, but you guys are wrong. i just dont want to be divorced three times. 
<phoebe> yes, and now hes using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. i must say, "well done!" bravo meg. 
<ross>  okay! fine! fine! if-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! okay, i-ill go to my lawyers office right now and get this marriage annulled! okay?! because she means nothing to me! nothnothing!! 
<s> okay now i wouldnt date you because you seem a little creepy. 
<s> i am so attracted to him right now. 
< 
<chandler> okay, when are we gonna tell rachel what is actually gonna happen? 
<monica> soon! i-i just couldnt before. you saw how upset joey got! i couldnt do that to her, shes my best friend! 
<chandler> well, joeys my best friend. 
<monica> im not your best friend? 
<chandler> you just said of course youre my best friend. would you please tell rachel though? 
<monica> all right, all right, at least im prepared. 
<chandler> okay.  oh yes.  
<monica>  hey! 
<chandler> hey-hey! 
<monica> these arent for you! are you upset? 
<chandler> i am now! 
<rachel>  hey roomie! 
<chandler> okay, bye!  
<monica> rach, theres something uh, important i have to tell you. 
<rachel>  are you pregnant?! 
<monica> no! but, im throwing this shirt away! i think there was a little misunderstanding before. 
<rachel> um-hmm. 
<monica> umm, when i said that uh, that chandler and i wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together. 
<rachel>  oh my god! oh, thats funny, i cant believe i did that. 
<monica> oh no sweetie, no! this is my fault, i wasnt clear! im really sorry. and listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? theres absolutely no rush. 
<rachel> okay.  
<monica> okay. dont you want a cookie? 
<rachel> sure?  thanks. 
<monica> maybe, do you need a tissue?  
<rachel> monica, where did you get these?! 
<monica> i made them! 
<rachel> ooh, good god, theyre so yummy!  
< 
<joey> god, its gonna so weird like when i come home and youre not here. yknow? no more joey and chans. no more j and cs. "you wanna go over to joey and chandlers?" "cant, its not there." 
<chandler> look, im just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff. 
<joey> yeah but we wont be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future. 
<chandler> not once did we do that. 
<monica>  hi. 
<chandler> hey! 
<joey> hi. 
<monica> so i, i told rachel it was just gonna be the two of us. 
<chandler> oh yeah? well, howd she take it? 
<monica> really well. yeah. surprisingly well. yeah, she didnt cry. she wasnt angry or sad.  
<chandler> and youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry? 
<monica> i mean, all im asking for is just a little emotion! is that too much to ask after six years?! i mean what? are-are-are rachel and i not as close as you guys?! i mean do we not have as much fun?! dont i deserve a few tears?!! i mean we-we told joey, he cried his eyes out! 
<joey> hey! i did not cry my eyes out!! come on! its like the end of an era! no more j-man and channies!! 
<chandler> okay, i gotta ask, who calls us that?! 
< 
<s> you got married again. 
<ross> yes. 
<s> so thats your second marriage in two years. 
<ross> yes, second in two years. third overall. 
<s> ross, i have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had i so much business from one client. why dont you tell me what happened. 
<ross> basically, rachel and i were in vegas and we got drunk 
<s>  im sorry, is this the same rachel whos name you said at the altar in the second marriage? 
<ross> yes-yes-yes! but, i-i do not love her. 
<s> oh, thats better then. 
<ross> this was just a drunken mistake and i need to get it annulled. 
<s> i see. have you considered therapy? 
<ross> i think just the annulment for today. 
<s> there are a couple of forms to fill out. 
<ross> easy. 
<s> and well need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind. 
<ross> no problem. 
<s> and well need you and rachel to testify before a judge. 
<ross> ooh! theres no way to do this without her? cause i kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of. 
<s> of course you did. look ross, you cant get an annulment unless you and rachel are both there. 
<ross> uh-ha, what about someone who looks like rachel?  i will think about the therapy. 
< 
<rachel> hey! 
<monica> hey. so um, i was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff. 
<rachel> okay! 
<monica> yknow, no point in dragging it out. dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore. 
<rachel> okay. 
<monica> hey rach, what about this?  huh? who-who gets this? see, i dont know if i want it because it might be yknow, too many memories! 
<rachel>  what the hell is that? 
<monica> i dont know.  hey, rachel, you want the big plate? i want you to have the big plate. 
<rachel> wow! mon, thanks! i love this plate! 
<monica> something to remember me by! 
<rachel> mon, honey youre not dying. im just moving out. yknow, i mean were gonna see each other all the time. 
<monica> but still, its a big change. the end of an era, you might say! 
<rachel> are you okay? youre not blinking. 
<monica> im fine! i just, im thinking how much its an end of era. 
<rachel> oh, all right. but yknow i gotta say, i dont, i dont think six years counts as an era. 
<monica> an era is defined as a significant period of time. now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasnt significant to you! 
<rachel> what is the matter with you?! 
<monica> what is the matter with you?!! why arent you more upset?! arent you gonna be sad that were not gonna be living together anymore?! i mean arent you gonna miss me at all?! 
<rachel> all right, fine, but dont get mad at me. its-its just a little hard to believe. 
<monica> whats hard to believe? 
<rachel> well yknow, its you guys. you-you do this kind of stuff! yknow? i mean, you-you were gonna get married in vegas and then you backed out! i guess im not upset because i dont see you guys going through with it. im sorry. 
<monica> rachel, its going to happen. chandler is gonna move in here. 
<rachel> but i 
<monica> no-no, wait! just let me finish, okay? this isnt something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in vegas, this is something we both really want. and it is going to happen. 
<rachel> it is? really? 
<monica> yeah, sweetie. 
<rachel>  i mean were not, were not gonna live together anymore? 
<monica> no. 
<rachel> what? oh my god! im gonna miss you so much!  
<monica> im gonna miss you!  
<rachel> i mean its the end of an era! 
<monica> i know! 
< 
<phoebe>  okay, bye! 
<ross> oh no. 
<phoebe> so? did you get the annulment? 
<ross> i couldnt. 
<phoebe> i knew it! because you love rachel. 
<ross> its not that. okay? annulments are more complicated than i 
<phoebe> yeah, complicated cause of the love. 
<ross> i i do, i do not love rachel. im gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. okay? would i do that if i loved her? 
<phoebe> ive never been more convinced of your love for her. 
<ross> i do not have feelings for rachel! okay?!   
<ross> ohh, whats wrong?! 
<rachel> monica and chandler are really moving in here and i have to move out and everything is changing. 
<ross> oh mycome here! come here!  its okay. everythings gonna be okay. 
<rachel> thank you. 
<ross> of course.  ending credits 
< 
<joey> so, ross and rachel got married, monica and chandler almost got married, do you think you and i should hook up? 
<phoebe> oh we do, but not just yet. 
<joey> really?! well, when? 
<phoebe> okay umm, well, first chandler and monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. yeah. but it wont work out. 
<joey> wow. 
<phoebe> i know. then, im gonna marry chandler for the money and youll marry rachel and have the beautiful kids. 
<joey> great! 
<phoebe> but then we ditch those two and thats when we get married. well have chandlers money and rachels kids and getting custody will be easy because of rachels drinking problem. 
<joey> oh-oh, what about ross? 
<phoebe> i dont want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and 
< 
<chandler>  hey! 
<phoebe> hey! check it out! this is unbelievable! joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!  
<joey>  dude! what are yoyou trying to kill me?! 
<rachel>  pheebs, i wanna ask you something. 
<phoebe> uh-huh, what? 
<rachel> well since im movin out and-and youre so beautiful 
<phoebe> oh! 
<rachel> how about i move in with you? 
<phoebe> well, that would be great but then what do we do about denise? 
<monica> whos denise? 
<phoebe> my roommate. 
<rachel> you have a roommate?! 
<phoebe> yes, denise. denise! 
<joey> hey, what is with the secrecy phoebe? huh? and what about this denise, is she cute? 
<chandler> pheebs, i dont understand. how can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about? 
<phoebe> maybe because you never listen to anything that i say. i talk about her all the time! denise!!!!! 
<joey> hey rach, listen i was thinkin uh, im gonna have an extra room over at my place 
<rachel> oh, thats true. 
<joey> yeah, why dont you move in with me? itll be great! we could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about naked thursdays right? 
<rachel> yeah, yeah i think im gonna find my own place. 
<chandler> hey-hey! i thought naked thursdays was just our thing man! opening credits 
< 
<phoebe> hey. 
<ross> hey! 
<phoebe> so, what did rachel say when you told her you were still married to her? 
<ross> oh, that. umm, she took it really well. 
<phoebe> you didnt tell her did you? 
<ross> no. 
<phoebe> of course not, because youre in love with her. 
<ross> i am not in love with her. she was very upset about having to move out so i eh, didnt tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. i-i just comforted her, as a friend. 
<phoebe> what do you mean, comforted her? 
<ross> its nothing, i just gave her a hug. 
<phoebe> ah-ha! a classic sign of love, the hug! 
<ross> its also a sign of friendship. 
<phoebe> yeah, not in your case lovey loverson.  
<ross>  it was a hug! 
<phoebe> okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair? 
<ross> s-s-smell her hair? what if i did? 
<phoebe> ninety percent of a womens pheromones come out the top of her head! thats why, thats why women are shorter. so that men will fall in love when they hug them!  oh come on ross, youre a scientist. 
<ross> i was hugging her as a friend. its not my fault her-her hair got in my face, shes got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh coconutty.  what?! oh, that doesnt mean i have feelings for rachel! maybe it means i have feelings for coconuts! 
<phoebe>  okay, whatever you say. but just be careful, all right? rachels not in the same place you are. 
<ross>  if the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because i am not in that place! 
<phoebe> okay, i didnt understand that, but yknow, maybe thats cause you were speaking the secret language of love!  
< 
<joey> hey!  dude, some guy just called for you. 
<chandler> who was it? 
<joey> i dont know! how about, "thanks for taking the message." jeez!  
<monica> okay listen, yknow when you move in rachels room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it? 
<chandler> sure! 
<monica> okay, i was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! and we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! okay, whatever, i really havent thought about it that much. 
<chandler> well, i like that idea. obviously! i was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yknow? i mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like space invaders and asteroids for $200, the real ones! the big-big ones! 
<monica> no. 
<chandler> okay so you mean no as in, "gee chandler, what an interesting idea. lets discuss it before we reject it completely." 
<monica> oh, im sorry. of course i mean that. interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no. 
<chandler> so, thats it? 
<monica> i just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. the beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques. 
<chandler> which is why asteroids is perfect! its the oldest game! 
<monica> what do you have against the beautiful guest room? 
<chandler> i dont have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away! 
<monica> are you mocking me? 
<chandler> no, im not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room.  
< 
<joey> hey, whats up? 
<chandler> nothing, monica and i had a stupid fight. 
<joey> but youre still moving in together, right? because my ad came out today.  
<chandler>  "wanted. female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." nice! 
<joey> yeah? i just figured yknow, after living with you itd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, yknow? someone i can learn from, someone-someone whos different than me. and whats more different than me; a guy whos not 19 than say a girl who is 19? enh?  not just a hat rack my friend! 
< 
<rachel> pheebs, i have to ask you 
<phoebe> shhhhhh! im swamped right now. 
<rachel> youre just staring into space. 
<phoebe> umm, im trying to move that pencil.  
<rachel> this one?  
<phoebe> it worked! 
<rachel> pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! every place i can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. i mean, look at this;  "wanted. female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." its just, there is nothing! the citys full! 
<phoebe> wait, no, look at this!  "two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, satan worshipers okay " oh, yeah, but its on the ground floor. 
<ross>  hey! 
<rachel> hey. 
<ross> rach, uh, you still looking for a place? 
<rachel> yeah! why? 
<ross> okay, theres this guy, warren, from the museum and hes going on a dig for like two years and hes got this great place he needs to sublet. so uh, you interested? 
<rachel> that sounds great! id love to live at warrens!! i love warren! thank you! 
<ross> dont thank me! if you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.  heres warrens number. 
<rachel> oh, this is great! i am gonna call him right now!  oh, thank you!  
<ross> okay, you go grab it! 
<phoebe> i saw it. 
<ross> i dont know what youre talking about. 
<phoebe> umm, im talking about that which you already know but wont admit. you love her again; you re-love her! 
<ross> look, i do not re-love her. 
<phoebe> i cant believe you wont just admit it!  okay, just promise me that you wont do anything stupid. 
<ross> look, were just friends now! okay? why would i do anything stupid? 
<rachel>  ugh!!! well, the apartment is already subletted! i mean, this is just hopeless. im never gonna find anything. 
<ross> you can live with me. 
<rachel> what?! 
<phoebe> what?! 
<ross> what? commercial break 
< 
<rachel> oh my god! are you serious?! 
<ross> uh-huh.  
<rachel> i would love to live with you ross; thats-thats great! thank you! 
<ross> well, im-im just glad i could, yknow, help you out. 
<phoebe> wow! im-im so happy for you guys.  this is so-so, not stupid. 
<rachel> ross-ross, you have no idea what this means to me! i mean, i mean i was gonna be homeless. you just saved me! youre my hero! 
<ross> hero, i uh, i dont knowwell, all right. 
<rachel> oh, i have to go tell monica what a wonderful brother she has!  
<ross> oh please!  youre gonna say things now, arent ya? 
<phoebe> no. no, i wont. but i should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate denise. she moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didnt love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! and thats how she ended up living with me!  okay, thats a lie. 
< 
<chandler> hi. 
<monica> hi. 
<chandler> hi, listen, im sorry about before. i dont need to have a game room. i mean when i was a kid i only played those games because i couldnt get girls, and now i can emnow, i have you.  not-not that i think that i have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, i see women 
<monica> stop it chandler.  im sorry too. 
<chandler> really? 
<monica> yeah! oh yes! 
<chandler> ohh. 
<monica> listen, we dont have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together. 
<chandler> thats a great idea! we can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room. 
<monica> totally!  
<chandler> we dont have to come up with this now. 
<monica> oh good. 
<chandler> hey, yknow what? why dont we think about changes we can make in the living room? 
<monica> changes? 
<chandler> yeah, i mean were gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.  
<monica> youre-youre-youre gonna bring the barca lounger over here? 
<chandler> is that a problem? 
<monica> well, its a set and they should probably stay together. 
<chandler> oh, thats cool. then ill just bring them both over. 
<monica> see now-now youre taking them away from their home. 
<chandler> okay, i get it. so, i get nothing! nothing here is mine! everything here is yours! ill get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work! 
<monica> yeah-yeah, yknow what? yeah, thats it-thats it, everything will be mine! nothing will be yours! thats-thats what i said! oh come on, chandler! im talking about the barca lounger! it just, it doesnt match! where is it gonna go?! 
<chandler> in the game room! 
<monica> look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly! 
<chandler> all right! thats fine! thats fine! i wont bring over the chairs! i wont bring anything over! i wouldnt want to ruin the ambiance over here at grandmas place!!  
< 
<joey>  everything on your application looks really goodohh! just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out? 
<joey> whoa!! now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. i want you to really think about your answers. okay? 
<chandler>  you can call off the roommate search!  hi! ill be living here.  
<joey> oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but i dont think hes gonna get it. 
<chandler> why did you take the shower curtain down? 
<joey> that thing was a hazard!  im very safety conscious. 
< 
<rachel> hey! 
<ross> hey! oh listen, i was just clearing some space for your stuff. 
<rachel> oh thanks, but listen, i was just at monicas and she and chandler had a big fight and theyre not moving in. 
<ross> what do you mean, theyre not moving in? they-theyre still moving in right? 
<rachel> no-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room. 
<ross> what?! over a stupid room! 
<rachel> yeah, i feel kinda bad for them, but im also really psyched cause i dont have to move in here! 
<ross> oh no, yeah no, that parts great! 
< 
<ross> whats all this about you guys fighting?! is this really over a room?! i mean, that is so silly! 
<monica> ross, we can handle this. 
<ross> well, apparently not, and i cant just stand by and watch two people i care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. i mean, enough of the silliness! 
<chandler> well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly!  
<ross>  okay-okay! two very good points, look ive known you both a long time, and ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together. do you really want to throw that all away over a room? that is so silly. now wh-what is more important, love or silliness? 
<chandler> well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love. 
<monica> love is the best medicine. 
<chandler> thats laughter. 
<monica> why do you do it? 
<chandler> i dont know. 
<ross> okay! all right! now, chandler you-you wanna live with monica, right? 
<chandler> yeah, i do. 
<ross> and mon, you wanna live with chandler, dont ya? 
<monica> yes. 
<ross>  good! a verbal contract is binding in the state of new york!  
< 
<s> so i understand youre looking for a place. 
<rachel> no-no, im staying put. 
<s> oh, i was going to offer you my apartment. 
<rachel> why, where are you going? 
<s> i dont know. 
<ross>  hey rach! 
<rachel> hi! 
<ross> youre never gonna believe it uh, monica and chandler are moving in again. thats great news righti mean for them. right? 
<rachel> oh wow. 
<ross> yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again. 
<rachel> yeah. yknow umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, ross i really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but dont you think its gonna be weird? 
<ross> wh-why?! why-why-why would it, why would it be weird? 
<rachel> well, because of us! because of our history. 
<ross> no! 
<rachel> no? 
<ross> no! no! it would be weird if we were still in that place, i mean are you still in that place? 
<rachel> no! not at all! 
<ross> good! me neither! so its not a problem. were just two friends who happen to be roommates. 
<rachel> okay, but ross, eventually you and i are gonna be dating. 
<ross> really?! we are? 
<rachel> yeah! im gonna have a boyfriend, youre gonna have a girlfriend 
<ross> ohh! that would be great. 
<rachel> but yknow what, if you think its gonna be okay well just work out a system. yknow, itll be like college, ill hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "come back later, im gettin lucky."  
<ross>  yeah, i didnt think of that. 
< 
<ross> so are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! i mean its a really big step! and-and whats the rush?!  
<monica> thats very funny! 
<chandler> hes being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness! 
<ross> no, i-i-im serious, okay? i mean, think about it. you move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing yknow you break up! 
<monica> ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room. 
<ross> okay, there are no stupid fights!! this isnt about the room, this is about what the room represents! and unfortunately, this room  could destroy you!! 
<chandler> yeah, i'm not so worried. 
<monica> yeah, no, me neither. 
<ross> fine! its your life!  i just dont want to see you guys break up! which you will do if you move in together,  but thats what you want, theres nothing i can do.  dont do it!!!!!  
<monica> you still want to move in together right? 
<chandler> of course! 
<monica> ross didnt scare you? 
<chandler> scared me out of ever wanting to live with him. 
<monica> come here, i want to show you something!

<monica> okay! 
<chandler> yknow those big-big uh, road signs that say "merge?"

<monica> oh my god! i love that! 
<chandler> really?! 
<monica> uh, no!! 
<

<joey> umm, listen, ross do you really think this moving in with rachel is a good idea? 
<ross> ive been back and forth. 
<joey> yeah well, maybe you should go back! okay? rachel moves in, and before you know it youre right where you dont want to be! back together! 
<ross> ehh, i dont, i dont think so. shes already talked about yknow, dating other guys. 
<joey> thats not gonna work out! then shes gonna come home all weepy and youll be tellin her, "oh thats okay. youll find someone." and then, bamn! she finds you! 
<ross> yeah, well, m-maybe youre right. 
<joey> i am telling you ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! now, is that what you want?

<phoebe> ross, i know what youre thinking.

<ross> oh my god! i-i see what this is! you are in love with rachel! 
<phoebe> what?!!

<rachel> yeah honey you dont believe her do you? 
<phoebe> i dontshe said yknow that id have triplets! but she also said one of them would be black. 
<chandler> just out of curiosity did she tell you how youre gonna go? 
<phoebe> no, cause she didnt tell me i was gonna die until the very end of the session, and i was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! i mean ive only got a week left, yknow? ive really gotta start living now! , leans back, and starts reading.)

<joey>  uh ross! are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?

<chandler>  "benefits lapsed." 
<joey> hmm thats weird. i dont remember being in a move called benefits lapsed. 
<chandler> okay, its not a check. theyre saying your health insurance expired because, you didnt work enough last year. 
<joey> let me see that! 
<chandler> all right. 
<joey>  oh, i cant believe this! this sucks! when i had insurance i could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, yknow? and it wouldnt matter. now i gotta be careful?! 
<chandler> im sorry man, theres never a good time to  stop catching on fire. 
<joey> all right well, i guess i gotta go get a job. im gonna go see my agent.

<rachel> wow, thats great ross, im sorry we werent more supportive before. 
<ross> i knew all i had to do was let the material speak for itself. everyones all, "ross you have to be funny and sexy." well, i proved them wrong! and now, im gonna pass the news onto joey and chandler. 
<monica> that youre not funny or sexy? 
<ross> thats right!

<chandler> whats wrong with you? 
<joey> nothing! well, i-i got this blinding pain in my stomach when i was lifting weights before, then i uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since. but um, i dont think its anything serious. 
<chandler> this sounds like a hernia. you have toyou-you go to the doctor! 
<joey> no way! kay look, if i have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!  
<chandler> thats a hernia.

< 
<chandler> hey, will you grab me a cruller?  sit down! will you go to the hospital?! 
<joey> dude! hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. besides its getting darker and more painful, that means its healing. 
<chandler> i will loan you the money. just go to the hospital and lets just get that thing pushed back in. 
<joey> thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and i dont want that hanging over my head. okay? besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in i can get all the free operations i want! yeah, im thinking ill probably start with that laser eye surgery too.  
<phoebe> hey! 
<chandler> hey. 
<joey> hey! 
<phoebe> whats going on? 
<chandler> oh joeys got a really bad hernia, but thats nothing a little laser eye surgery wont fix!

<rachel> yeah, i mean, come on ross, no one will even notice. i mean theyre probably not even listening! 
<ross> theyre not listening too me? 
<rachel> of course theyre listening to you! everybody listens to you. 
<ross> monica you really think i should try this phasing out thing? 
<monica> i think you look fine.

<rachel> ross got married againnooooooo!!!!!!!!!

<ross>  all right, keep going. we are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. so without out re-testing the results in the laboratory  the team would never have identified  the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis . were there any questions at this point?  yes.

<phoebe>  please! please! please! please! oh please! please! please! frank and alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and im nervous cause ive never done that before by myself! 
<monica> dont worry about it phoebe, well absolutely do it. 
<chandler> yeah, im gonna pass. cause i was kinda iffy when it was puppies. 
<monica> come on chandler, come on! itll give us great practice for whenpeople with babies come to visit. 
< 
<joey> yeah, its not mine. 
<s>  i love your car. 
<joey> yeah, its  mine. 
<s> i bet its fast. 
<joey> me too! yeah. and comfortable. do uh, do you like leather seats? 
<s> yeah! 
<joey>  its got em! 
< 
<rachel> so, i still have boxes here. i still have boxes at rosss, and i have nowhere to live! wow. i could so easily freak out right now. 
<phoebe> what about me? i just found out that denise is leaving town for a while, i dont have a roommate. 
<rachel> well, maybe-maybe i could be your roommate pheebs. 
<phoebe> maybe you could be my roommate! 
<rachel> well theres an idea!! 
<phoebe> yeah! 
<rachel> that would be great! wait, how long is denise gone for? 
<phoebe> umm, she said shed be back december 26th. 
<rachel> december 26th, huh maybe shes santa clause.  
<rachel>  oh look who it is, my husband. the apple of my eye. 
<ross> okay, i got us a court date for tomorrow at and i picked up all the forms. ill take care of everything. 
<rachel> well sure, if you say youre gonna take care of everything i have no reason to doubt you. give me those forms!  all right, now im gonna do this my way and i dont want to hear a peep out of you! 
<ross> okay rach, but 
<rachel> op! youre peeping!  
<rachel> ross! yknow what, i just gotwhy? why did you do this?! 
<ross> look i told you 
<rachel> i dont wanna hear "three failed marriages!" 
<ross> look, if youd had two failed marriages, youd understand! 
<rachel> well, yknow what? thanks to you im half way there! ugh! oh! i am so mad! ross, i dont think i have ever been this angry! 
<ross> what about the time i said we were on a break? 
<rachel> ugh!  
< 
<monica> pheebs, hows it going? 
<phoebe>  im doing okay. i think its going well. do you think theyre having fun? am i talking to fast? 
<monica> nope, sound like me. pheebs, its going great. look at chandler with little baby girl chandler. 
<chandler> little baby girl chandler, where i have heard that before? oh right, coach ruben.  do you know what pheebs? when youre done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.  
<phoebe> na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies. 
<chandler> see thats where i think that youre wrong. weve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense. 
<monica> what do you mean? 
<chandler> i just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. and yknow mon, you can be in charge of diapering and i can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around  
<phoebe> that sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping. 
<chandler> okay, im a rookie. i should not be in the end zone. chandler adds the powder, begrudgingly, and monica puts the diaper on.] 
<monica> this is so great! this is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant. 
<phoebe> yeah?  well this is not what i ordered. 
<joey>  hey guys! 
<chandler> hey! 
<phoebe> hey! 
<joey> hey babies! oh, im having the best morning. that uh, that porsche ive got the keys too, still there! 
<chandler> shocking! since you still have the keys. 
<joey> you should see the treatment i get when im with that car! people are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! one guy gave me advice about my equity investments. 
<chandler> what equity investments? 
<joey> the ones that got me the porsche! will you keep up!  but i figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, theyre gonna start to think that i dont own it. so i figured ill wash it. right? monica, you got a bucket and some soap i can borrow? 
<monica> oh yeah, i got soap and sponges and rags and carnuba wax and polishing compound. 
<chandler> you dont even have a car! 
<monica> i know. but umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so i washed it. 
<chandler> and? 
<monica> and six others. 
<chandler> there you are. 
< 
<joey> yeah, she tops out at 130. 
<joey> and thats just in the city. i get her up to 160 when i take her upstate. 
<joey> sure! 
<joey> okay, take it easy. 
<joey> really? oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it. 
<joey> oh i-i uh, found the keys and now im just polishing her up. 
<joey> yeah, but its my wax. dont know if youre crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could i have my keys. 
<joey> sure. here.  ill uh, save your parking spot. 
<joey> why not? 
<joey> yeah, so did i.  
< 
<phoebe> i dont know why i was so nervous about this. and i dont know why frank and alice are always complaining. this is so easy. 
<monica> yeah, two hours, a lifetime thats the same. 
<chandler>  check it out! check it out! when the babies wake up, they can meet krog!  
<monica> chandler, what are you doing? that thing can put someones eye out! 
<chandler> he can do more than that! he can destroy the universe! 
<phoebe> no chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! and also, look at his smooth area, thats just gonna mess them up. 
<chandler> theyre not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. when i was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass! 
<phoebe> what?! 
<chandler> glass, sand, whatever.  
<phoebe> oh, look at little leslie stretching in her sleep. 
<monica> oh its so cute. i wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head. 
<phoebe> oh, i can still do that. 
<monica> how are you still single?! 
<chandler>  all right.  i thought about it and maybe youre right. maybe krog is not a safe toy. 
<monica> good. what made you change your mind? 
<chandler> i swallowed the sonic blaster gun. 
<phoebe> how did that happen?!! 
<chandler> well, i was trying to prove that i was right. yknow? and it turns out i was wrong. and now its lodged in my throat.  
<monica> damnit! yknow this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching chandler!  
< 
<s> okay you two are asking the court for an annulment? 
<rachel> yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out. 
<s> so based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that mr._geller is mentally unstable. 
<ross> fine, im mentally unstable. 
<s> and based on the fact that mr._geller is intravenous drug user. 
<ross> what?! 
<rachel> uh yes, heroin and crack. 
<ross> crack isnt even an intravenous drug! 
<rachel> well, you would know. 
<s> now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage? 
<ross> oh, come on! 
<rachel>  ross, please, i found the magazines! 
<s> and finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. well, that makes sense since youre gay and addicted to heroin. 
<ross> okay, im sorry, this is insane! i-i-im not addicted to heroin, im not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! look, ill consummate this marriage right here, right now! 
<s> that wont be necessary. 
<ross> and when we were dating we consummated like bunnies! 
<rachel> ugh! 
<s> now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem. 
<rachel> ross! your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago!  and could you strike "consummated like bunnies" from the record? 
<s> is there, anything in this record that is actually true? 
<rachel> well, yes, we got married in vegas and uh, and the names i think. 
<s> well, based on what i heard, you two certainly dont qualify for an annulment. if you two dont want to be together youll have to file for divorce. 
<ross>  thats great! are you happy now? look what you did with your funny, funny form! 
<rachel>  what?! me?! what about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense! 
<ross> and whatwhat are you typing that for? did you hear what she said? we dont get the annulment. dont type that! what?! stop typing!  hey! stop typing!  stop typing! stop typing!! 
<rachel>  okay, do you see, do you see what youre keeping me married too?! 
<s> you need to get out of my chambers. 
<rachel> all right look lady here is the deal, i came here for an annulment and i am not leaving here until i get one! 
<ross> yeah! 
<s> would you like to spend the night in jail? 
<rachel> and thank you for your time.  commercial break 
< 
<joey>  so the porsche guy took his car back. 
<chandler> but you found the keys to his clothes? 
<joey> no. no, i just uh, i just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks i own a porsche. 
<monica> and people will think you own a porsche because youre wearing the clothes? 
<joey> of course! only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car! right? 
<chandler> that is true. 
<phoebe> yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun. 
<joey> oh, ive been there. yeah, i am gonna go drive my porsche.  
<monica> joey, you know you dont actually have one. 
<joey> come on! what are you doing?! im in character! would you talk to her!  
<chandler> ahh, i think it just moved. its really poking me. 
<monica> all right, thats it, were going to the emergency room. 
<phoebe> what?! no, you cant, you cant leave me here with them! were baby-sitting! 
<monica> the babies are asleep, im sure youll be okay on your own for a while! 
<phoebe> but you-you cant leave me with them! we-were a team! were playing a zone! theyre gonna triple team me! 
<monica> hes got something plastic lodged in his throat, weve got to go to the hospital. 
<phoebe> but no, because a doctor wont be able to help him, its just gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years. 
<chandler> i think thats gum. 
<phoebe> im pretty sure its gun. 
<chandler> okay, listen this really hurts. lets go. 
<phoebe> a real man wouldnt just run to the hospital!  no! what would, what would krog do?  
< 
<joey> why isnt that valet back with my porsche? 
<s> maybe because youve got the keys? 
<joey>  porsche.  
<rachel> this is totally your fault! 
<ross> my fault?! you threatened the judge! 
<rachel> well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporters machine!! 
<ross> that was the only way i could get him to stop typing! 
<joey> hi! how are the gellers? 
<rachel> dont call us that!  
<ross> the judge wouldnt let us get an annulment! now we gotta get a divorce!! did a porsch throw up on you?  
<joey> hey! its porsche!!  
< 
<phoebe> me taking care of you is no problem, huh? you guys feel safe. right? okay, im gonna take that spit bubble as, "yeah, i do!" okay, after i get rid of this dirty diaper leslie, ill set you up with a clean one.  okay, im sorry. i didnt mean to scare you. i just have to clean that up. okay? cause lets face it, were at monicas.  i broke it. all right. well, thats just the way that goes.  okay, good.  why are there only two of you? where is leslie? well, you cant answer.  leslie? where are you leslie? leslie, now would be a good time for your first words!  well, look at you! hey! you are a little bit mischievous! my gosh!  oh, youre a lot mischievous! well, itll dry.  okay, you sit with your brother and sister nowwho arent there!  monicas apartment looks like a tornado, a hurricane, a swarm of locusts, fire, brimstone, hail, and giant man-eating, radioactive ants have torn the place apart. needless to say, its messy enough to cause monica to die of shock right away. parents with small children know what im talking about.] 
<chandler>  hey! 
<phoebe>  how do you feel? 
<chandler> well, lets just say that krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours. 
<phoebe> okay, so i totally took care of the babies all by myself! i fed em, bathed em, and put em to bed. 
<chandler> and protected them from a tornado?  
<monica> oh my god. 
<phoebe> i know, the babies are asleep. 
<monica> phoebe, what, what happened here?! 
<phoebe> i did it! i took care of the babies all by myself! 
<monica> but my apartment! 
<chandler> was the setting of phoebes triumph. 
<monica> but the mess! 
<chandler> is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies all by herself. 
<monica> youre right, youre right i shouldnt freak out. cause this is what will happen when you and i have babies! when will that be?! 
<chandler>  phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!! 
< 
<rachel>  oh honey thank god youre home, i was getting worried. 
<ross> i picked up the divorce papers. uh, ive already signed everything and i put little xs where you need to sign. 
<rachel> oh, little xs! great! that makes up for everything! 
<ross> yknow, i-iyouve done a lot of stupid stuff too! okay? 
<rachel> oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one! 
<ross> okay, how about you flew to london to stop my wedding! ah, how about you told me you loved me after i was already married! 
<rachel> hey! wait a minute! that was different! i did those things because i was in love with you! 
<ross> yeah! right!  
<ross> youre right. thats very different. so lets, lets just sign the papers. all right?  what? 
<rachel> nothing.  
<ross> okay, can we just sign please? 
<rachel> uh-hmm.  
<ross> congratulations.  
<rachel> okay ross, werewait a minute. umm, i uh, i kinda have a little confession. 
<ross> what? 
<rachel> well, yknow this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea. 
<ross> excuse me? 
<rachel> well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married? 
<ross> yeah? 
<rachel> and uh, yeah, i didnt really, i didnt want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. and uh, and i thought it would be funnier if we got married. so as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then  to eat a lot of grapes. so umm, sorry i got us into this mess. 
<ross> so then if-ifi mean if you think about it, this is all  your fault. 
<rachel> yeah, dont push it though. 
<ross> ive got to say; i know i divorce a lot of women, never thought i would be divorcing you. 
<rachel> i know. i always thought if you and i got married, it would be the one that stuck. and it wouldnt be a secret, and we wouldnt have our wedding dinner at pizza hut.  
<ross> did i, did i even treat? 
<rachel> no, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special. 
<ross> that may be the most depressing thing ive heard in my life. i should probably get these to my lawyers office. 
<rachel> hey, thanks ross, for taking care of all of this. 
<ross> eh, no problem.  
<rachel> im gonna need a copy of those. 
<ross> totally.  ending credits 
< 
<joey> hey! hey! be careful around my porsche! 
<s>  hi joey. 
<joey> hey! how you doin? 
<s>  he has the most amazing porsche under there! 
<joey> id love to show ya, but i just tucked her in. shes sleeping.  hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (just then the same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses 
< 
<chandler>  okay!  listen, im gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent. 
<joey> right! and when is that due? 
<chandler> first of the month. 
<joey> and thats every month? 
<chandler> no, just the months you actually want to live here. 
<joey> ahhh. 
<chandler> okay, here is the phone bill.  
<joey>  oh my god!! 
<chandler> thats our phone number. now look, i know i kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why dont i justwhy dont i just cover you for a while? 
<joey> no-no! no way! joey tribbiani does not take charity anymore. 
<chandler> its not charity, joe 
<joey> no! forget it! okayi mean thanks, but im done taking money from you. all right, i can take of myself. now, whats next? come on. 
<chandler> okay uh, heres the electric bill.  
<joey> this is how much we pay for electric?!!! 
<chandler> uh, yeah.  
<chandler> so, well do the rest of the bills later then? opening credits 
< 
<phoebe> so is joey going to have to give up the apartment? 
<chandler> no, i hope not! i tried to offer him some money, but he wouldnt take it. 
<phoebe> well, how much do you think he needs? 
<chandler> i figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, yknow? but i have to trick him into taking it so i wont hurt his pride. 
<phoebe> why dont you hire him as an actor? you could have him dress up and put on little skits. whatever you want. 
<chandler> well that would help the pride thing. 
<monica>  hey! 
<chandler> hey! wow! you look great! wanna move in with me tomorrow? 
<monica>  okay. 
<chandler> okay!  so, what do you girls have planned for tonight? 
<monica> well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with rachel we thought wed go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that rachel is moving in with phoebe. 
<phoebe> and also, my birthday. 
<monica> its not your birthday. 
<phoebe> what a mean thing to say! i would never tell you its not your birthday!  
<joey> hey! 
<ross> hey! 
<chandler> hey! 
<phoebe> hey! so you guys have anything planned for the big last night? 
<chandler> well, instead of just hanging out, we figure wed do nothing. 
<ross> whoa-whoa-whoa, knicks season opener tonight. i thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it. 
<joey> i dont know ross, not if youre gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist. 
<ross> i did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist! 
<rachel>  pheebs, i was wondering 
<monica> youre not dressed yet?! were supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes! 
<rachel> well and clearly not a minute sooner. 
<monica> rachel, you are packed though right, i mean please tell me that youre packed. 
<rachel> of course i packed! monica relax! i just wanted to ask phoebe her opinion on what i should wear tonight. 
<phoebe> my god, i cant get a minute of peace around this place.  
<phoebe> oh my god! monicas just gonna kill you. 
<rachel> yeah, yeah, i know. 
<phoebe> well, what youre wearing is fine for that. 
<monica>  rachel, i need to borrowyoure not packed!!!! youre not packed even a little bit! 
<rachel> surprise!! 
<monica> what? 
<rachel> no, no dont get mad because lookthis is what happened. so i-i started packing, then i realized, "what am i doing? i am lousy at packing!" right? but you love packing! so, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da! 
<monica>  ill be coordinator! oh my god! im so sorry, i didnt get you anything! okay, look everybody has to help! okay? you can help, cant you phoebe?

<monica> okay fine, now ross 
<ross> oh, but-but i cant do it. 
<monica> why not? 
<joey>  ive got ben.

<chandler> hes at a dinner party. 
<monica> is he really coming? because i can see right into your apartment! 
<ross> of course he is! what, do you think id just use my son as-as an excuse? what kind of father do you think i am? 
<monica> all right, sorry.  
<ross>  i gotta go make a fake ben. 
< 
<joey> here it is! our last pizzas together as roommates. 
<chandler> oh, i wish id know you were going to do that, i ordered chinese. 
<joey> oh thats okay. hey, actually in a way its kinda nice. me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!  
<chandler> say, joe, i had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. what do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money? 
<joey> what, are you crazy? you havent beaten me once since my injury plagued 97 season. it would be easier if you just give me your money. 
<chandler> yes it would. what do you say to $50? 
<joey> okay, youre on. 
<chandler> okay, lets play! the big game, italy vs. china, apparently.  
< 
<rachel> ohhhhhh, look its the roller blades.

<monica> no. 
<rachel> i guess you werent there.  
<phoebe> you guys, we said we were gonna have fun! come on, hey, remember the time  you dont remember? 
<rachel> im sorry pheebs, i guess im just really said that im leaving. 
<monica> im gonna miss you so much. 
<phoebe> well, this doesnt have to be so sad though. yknow? maybe instead of just thinking about how much youre gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things youre not gonna miss. 
<monica> i dont think theres anything. 
<phoebe> come on, theres gotta be something. 
<monica> nope, shes perfect. 
<rachel> i have one. 
<phoebe> good! great! you can go first. 
<rachel> uh well, i guess im not gonna miss the fact that youre never allowed to move the phone pen.  
<phoebe> good thats a good one. okay, monica, anything? yknow? does rachel move the phone pen? 
<monica> aw, sometimes. always, actually. 
<phoebe> okay, good. there you go. doesnt anyone feel better? 
<monica> not just the phone pen. i never get my messages. 
<rachel> you get your messages! 
<monica> yeah, well i dont think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch. 
<rachel> so-so, you missed a message from who? chandler or your mom? or chandler? or your mom? 
<phoebe> great! it worked! no ones sad. 
< 
<joey>  yes! i win again! ha-ha! thats like 500 bucks you owe me! whoo-ho-hoo!  $500 that is a loooot of electricity!  whoo-ho-ho!  i gotta buy some food.

<rachel> ooh, your brother. score! 
<monica>  whats up? 
<ross> oh, im just over here with ben. i thought wed say hi.

<ross> ben, say hi to aunt monica.  oh, i guess he doesnt feel like talking right now. hes smiling though! okay, talk to you later. 
< 
<phoebe> yeah, i think it was better when you guys were sad. hey, uh, remember the roller blades? 
<rachel> you know what else im not gonna miss? "im monica. i wash the toilet 17 times a day. even if people are on it!" 
<monica> "hi im rachel, is my sweater too tight? no? oh, id better wash it and shrink it!" 
<rachel> "im monica, i dont get phone messages from interesting people. ever!" 
<phoebe> hey! i call her! 
<monica> "oh my god, i love ross! i hate ross! i love ross! i hate ross!"

<phoebe> yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.  commercial break 
< 
<chandler> still broken? 
<joey> this sucks man! the last night youre here and i lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500. 
<chandler> well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little blackjack?  
<joey> nah, not my game. 
<chandler> okay, uh, how about, how aboutyknow what? we could play a new game. a new game, its fun. 
<joey> well, whats it called?

<chandler> oh yeah! okay, lets play again.  what do you got? 
<joey> a four and a nine. 
<chandler> youre kidding right? 
<joey> no. why? 
<chandler> well thats a full cup!  
<joey> damn! i am good at cups! 
< 
<monica> im not talking to her! 
<phoebe> well, one of you has to take the first step! and it should be you, because shes the one whos leaving. its harder for her! 
<monica> well, maybe youre rightshe made fun of my phone pen! 
<phoebe> i know, i took it hard too.  
<monica> listen rachel, i feel really bad aboutwhat are you doing?  
<rachel> im unpacking! 
<monica> what?! 
<rachel> im not moving!  is that picture straight? 
<monica> it needs to go about 20 blocks to the left! 
<rachel> hey, yknow what? youre the one who wants to make this big change and move in with chandler! you should be the one to go! why should i have to leave?! 
<monica> because its my apartment! 
<rachel> well its mine too! what else you got?! 
<monica> how about, youre moving!!  
<rachel> look! this is ridiculous. we should be packing you!!  
<phoebe> hey, how are you guys doing? 
<rachel> great! monicas moving! 
<monica>  i am not! 
<rachel> oh really?! then how come all your stuff is in this box?!  
<phoebe> okay, you guys. you guys i think i know whats going on here. okay, you guys stop!!  i know that, i know that youre acting mad because you think that itll make it easier to leave. but deep down youre still really sad. deep-deep down. 
<monica> no phoebe i am mad! 
<phoebe> well, deep-deep-deep down! 
<rachel> yeah, im just mad! 
<phoebe> then keep running.  
< 
<chandler> you win. 
<joey> well, what did you have? 
<chandler> it doesnt matter because nothing beats a three and a six. that my friend is d-cup. okay, now much have you won so far? 
<joey> uh,  wow, 700. 
<chandler> not 700 exactly? 
<joey> yeah. 
<chandler> double it!  
<joey> what? 
<chandler> well you see in cups, once you get $700, you have to double it. 
<joey> really? 
<chandler> hey, i didnt make up the rules. now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500.  dont get to excited because thats not gonna happen unless you getno way!  
< 
<monica> well, this is the last box of your clothes. im just gonna label it, "what were you thinking?" 
<rachel> funny, because i was just gonna go across the hall and write that on chandler. 
<phoebe> hey you guys, i dont mean to make things worse, but umm, i dont want to live with rachel anymore. 
<phoebe> youre just so mean to each other! and i dont want to end up like that with rachel. i still like you! 
<rachel> well, phoebe thats fine because im not moving. 
<monica> whoa-whoa-whoa, phoebe you gotta take her! yknow i-i-i said some really bad stuff about her, but yknow rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. 
<rachel> oh really? like what monica? 
<monica> yknow she has 147,000 pairs of boots 
<rachel> oh yeah, good start mon. 
<monica> she lets you borrow them. 
<rachel> yeah and you stretch em out with your big old clown feet. 
<monica> do you wanna live outside?! because its gettin cold!  she gets tons of catalogs and umm, shell fold down the pages of the things she thinks that id like. 
<phoebe> what else? 
<monica> when i take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror. 
<rachel> yeah, i do. i-i do, do that. 
<phoebe> thats nice. i like having things to read in the bathroom. 
<monica> when i fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket. 
<rachel> well yknow, i dont want you to be cold. 
<monica> and when i told her that i was gonna be moving in with chandler, she was really supportive.  you were so great. you made it so easy. and now you have to leave. and i have to live with a boy!!  
<rachel> oh, its gonna be fine. 
<phoebe> okay rachel, i cant wait to live with you! and you know what we should do? bring monica and then we could all live there together! well have so much fun!! 
<rachel> but honey, i think shes moving in with chandler. 
<phoebe> oh thats right. youre still set on that? 
<monica> kinda.  oh my god!  
<ross>  hello?  hey mon, hows the packing going?  ben? hes fine. yeah, hes rightoh my god!  get your head of your shirt there son!  what?  yeah, its a pumpkin. ill come pack. 
< 
<joey> hey! 
<chandler> whats wrong? 
<joey> ross and i were helping the girls pack, took a little break, i lost $1,500 to him in cups! 
<chandler> wh-how did you lose at cups?! 
<joey> the same way you lost. i started out with a king and a queen, bamn! ross gets a 2 and a 3. then i get a jack and a king, boom! ross gets a 4 and a 5! ross was getting the cup card, the d-cup, the sittin down bonus! meanwhile, i didnt even get half a cup! nothin!! 
<chandler> oh man!! 
<joey> and he never played before either! yknow what i think? i think beginners luck, very important in cups. 
<chandler> all right, lets play one more hand! one more! 
<joey> no, no, no more! i cannot lose another dime! im serious this time! in-in fact, look, theres ai wanna give you something. and let me give it too you know before i pawn it for cups money.  now, i want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, yknow, thank you for being such a great roommate. 
<chandler> i cant take the big white dog! you love it! 
<joey> its him, not it! 
<chandler> no, but waitwhat if i bought it from you, yknow? and your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say  $1,500? 
<joey> wait a second, i see what youre trying to do here! you-youre trying to give me money again! 
<chandler> when did i try to give you money? 
<joey> over there!  before, with the bills! you tried to give some charity, i said "no," you dropped it. okay? then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again! 
<chandler> im just trying to help you out! okay? i wanna make sure that youre okay. 
<joey> i will be okay! look chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that i cant take care of myself. okay? look, im not gonna miss you helping me out with money. the only thing that im gonna miss is you. and now the dog. 
< 
<monica> hey. call me when you get there. okay? 
<rachel> okay. 
<monica> im really gonna miss you.  
<rachel> oh! i have your key. here you go.

<chandler> no problem roomie.  
<monica> can i ask you a question? 
<chandler> sure! 
<monica> what the hell is that dog doing here?!   ending credits 
< 
<chandler> i invented the game of cups as a way to give joey money. 
<ross> and now you want that money back. 
<chandler> exactly. 
<ross> chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?  
<chandler> its not a real game! i made it up! 
<ross> im sorry you lost your money, but i won it fair and square. 
<chandler> at a fake game!! 
<ross> now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, id be glad to play you for it. but i should warn you, i am very good at cups. 
<chandler> okay! now i assume the saucer card came up when you played last. 
<ross> no. 
<chandler> hmm, lets see if it comes up this time. (he looks at his cards

< 
<ross> so, i just finished this fascinating book. by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. so theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine. 
<chandler>  and i just realized i can sleep with my eyes open.  
<monica> hey! 
<monica>  honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor! 
<chandler> i didn't nail the boxes to the floor. 
<monica> oh, so you can move them! 
<chandler> yes, and while i'm doing that, ross has a great computer story for you.

<ross> thank you for bringing her into our lives. 
<chandler> unbelievable 
<monica> oh, so you like her too chandler? 
<chandler> hey, look at all the boxes! 
<joey> ugh, i cannot wait to ask her out! 
<monica> wait a minute...joey. joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. it-it'll be way too complicated. 
<ross> yeah, yeah man don't do it. i mean if you date her, then-then-then i can't date her. 
<chandler> all right, think about it. now remember when you were going out with that girl donna and you guys broke up. remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket? 
<joey> oh god, yeah. 
<chandler> now imagine you live at the supermarket. 
<joey>  okay! 
<chandler> no-no 
<joey> oh, oh, you're right! i don't want that. i can't date her! 
<monica> yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble. 
<joey> well, that's gonna be tough mon. i mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt. 
<monica>  hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt. 
<joey> you a little sad about that sweetheart?

<rachel> you guys, i'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between kermit the frog and the six million dollar man. 
<ross> monica had such a crush on him. yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed. 
<rachel> oh! i used to do that too! 
<monica> did you also have his album, it's not easy being green? 
<rachel> aw, mon... 
<monica> so, phoebe runs weird huh?

<monica> why don't you just be straight with her? tell her the truth. 
<ross> yeah. 
<rachel> you're right, you're right. i should just tell her the truth.  
<phoebe> hey!

<joey> boy, it was so hard not to laugh, i tell ya. hey, hey, the place looks great! 
<chandler> yeah, not bad right? you know what, monicas gonna be working late, so i'm gonna make this place spotless. you know what else i'm gonna do, know what else i'm gonna do? i'm gonna go downstairs, i'm gonna get her some flowers. now who wouldn't wanna live with me? 
<joey>  i don't! no, i wanna live with the super-hot australian dancer. 
<chandler> yeah, now how's that going though? are you okay with the not-flirting thing? 
<joey> yeah. well, so far yeah. but it's tough you know? i got all this built up flirting energy and i don't know how to get rid of it.  how you doin?  
<joey>  ohhhh man 
<s> sorry, there's just more room out here. 
<joey> no-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, i need to do my stretches too.  
<s>  why don't you try to do- 
<joey>

<joey> uh-uh nothing. i-i-i-i didn't want you to touch me cause i'm -i'm all sweaty from the workout. i better hit the shower.  oh my god! 
<s> oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. it's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.   
<phoebe>  hi! oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. i saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. you lied so you could run by yourself. 
<rachel> no, no phoebe no, i was...no. you know what, i was, i was actually just checking to, see, if i could run. and i can! 
<phoebe> please rachel, i am not an idiot.  
<rachel> no, wait phoebe.  
<ross>  wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. so, mondler...uh, what uh, what cha doin? 
<chandler> what does it look like i'm doing? i am cleaning! 
<ross> did you get monica's authorization to move all of her stuff? 
<chandler> authorization? i don't need that. i'm gonna put everything back. 
<ross> put it back exactly where you found it? 
<chandler> yes i'm gonna put it back  exactly where i found it. 
<ross> kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping. 
<chandler> she's not gonna care if i put her stuff back in the same stupid place. 
<ross> whoa, hello, did you just meet monica? 
<chandler> she is gonna recognize that i did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it. 
<ross> hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. cause when you have to move back in with joey, joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me. 
<chandler> i see, i see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out. 
<ross> look chandler, monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. believe me, i lived with her for 16 years. she is going to freak out. oh my god, she's going to sit on you. 
<chandler> no, she's not okay? and i'll prove it to you. i'm gonna call her right now.  phone's done ehh. 
<monica>  hi! 
<chandler> hey mon, how's it going? 
<monica> terrible. if-if i want something done right, i have to do it myself. other people just wreck stuff. i really think i might kill someone tonight. 
<chandler> oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad. 
<monica> it's worse. the only thing that's getting me through is knowing that i'm gonna be seeing you soon. i think i may even try to get out of here early. 
<chandler> no! no-no-no-no-no-no. it sounds like they really need you down there. 
<monica>  well, are you just hanging out with ross? 
<chandler> it's, all good! okay bye-bye mon!  she's-she's gonna kill me. 
<ross> yeah, the phone was facing the other way.  and that goes back up there. commercial break 
< 
<chandler> we should start with the big stuff. yknow? that'll be the easiest. uh, let's start with the couch.  i got it.  
<ross> yeah that-that, doesn't look right. 
<chandler> what are you talking about? the couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. and then i can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... ok, ok, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table. 
<ross> whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet. 
<chandler> ok well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch. 
<ross> whoa, whoa, whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area. 
<chandler> yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...rooosss!!!! 
<joey>  look, what am i gonna do? i'm not flirting but still, i'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame!  what the hell's going on over here?!?!?  monica's gonna kill you! look i need your help, i have to do something to-to repel this woman! wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time. 
<ross> hey, i've been married 3 times  
<joey> no-no-no i've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. what's your secret? 
<ross> look, we do not repel women ok? that is completely untrue. 
<chandler> oh no, yes we do my man. remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the irish potato famine? 
<ross> yeah, well what about you? you weren't you know, so hot in college either. after everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh" 
<chandler> yeah, monica doesn't like that either, maybe i should stop doing that. 
<ross> oh y'know what, girls don't like it when i start talking about science. 
<chandler> that's not specific to girls. 
<joey> this is great, this is great, what else, what else? 
<ross> uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar. 
<chandler> and they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny. 
<ross> they don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you. 
<chandler> man, i'm so lucky i have monica. 
<ross>  i'm never gonna find love again. 
< 
<rachel> hey phoebe, can i talk to you for a second? 
<phoebe> sure 
<rachel> okay, um, i... all right phoebe look, i just wanted to say that i'm sorry. ok? i handled the situation horribly and i should not have lied to you. 
<phoebe> so, what should you have done? 
<rachel> well, i-i should've told you the truth. 
<phoebe> uh-huh, which is...? 
<rachel> well, y'know, the reason i didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little... 
<phoebe> so? 
<rachel> well, it's embarrassing. people were looking at us like we were crazy. 
<phoebe> why do you care? 
<rachel> because they're people. 
<phoebe> but people that you don't know and will never see again. 
<rachel> yes, but still. they're people with eyes. 
<phoebe> well, i didn't get embarrassed running next to miss . but no, okay. no, no, i can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. yeah, okay. you're uptight. 
<rachel> i-i am not uptighthey-hey-hey-oh-oh! listen, i am not uptight, man. 
<phoebe> that's okay rachel. i'm not judging you; that's just who you are. me. i'm more free y'know? i run like i did when i was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. y'know, i mean didnt you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from satan?  the neighbor's dog. 
< 
<chandler> okay, is this lamp in the same place? 
<ross> who cares? i repel women.  
<chandler>  no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! you can't come in here! r-r-r-r-ross is naked. 
<monica> what?! 
<ross>  what?! 
<chandler>  i couldn't say that i was naked because she's allowed too see me naked. 
<ross> why does anyone have to be naked? 
<monica> why is ross naked? 
<ross> i-i had to show chandler something? 
<monica> naked? 
<ross> yeah-yeah i uh, i have a uh, a guy problem. 
<monica> is it the same thing that chandler had? 
<chandler> look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later. 
<monica> okay, listen, there's still some of chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. bye! 
<chandler> bye! thank god 
<ross> dude, what'd you have? 
<chandler> look, we have no time okay? we must focus. we gotta get everything back into its original place. 
<ross>  the photo album! there were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. we just go through it and match everything to the pictures. 
<chandler> that's perfect! that's brilliant!  
<ross> so really, what'd ya have? 
< 
<s> hey joey, i got some beer for you. 
<joey> uh, don't you mean "for whom?" 
<s> sure, listen i was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one? 
<joey> pizza, heh, its not like i never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh. 
<s> is there something wrong? 
<joey> all right, all right, let's just get this out in the open okay? you're hot. i'm lovable. clearly there's a vibe going on between us. but, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road. 
<s> joey... 
<joey> no, no, no, i'm telling ya. imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? so the question is, what do we do? 
<s> well, i don't think there is anything to do. i mean i think you're really sweet, but i'm just not interested in you like that. 
<joey> oh! 
<s> no! i mean you're a really nice guy and i'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, i'm just y'know, i just don't feel that way about you. 
<joey> oh! i see what happened. it's because i was trying to repel you. right? believe me, you'd feel a lot different if i turned it on. 
<s> i don't think so. 
<joey> oh, i do.  how you doin? 
<s> i'm ok 
<joey> what?!?! 
<s> what? 
<joey> oh dear god! 
< 
<rachel>  hey! 
<phoebe> hey! 
<rachel> oh honey, i'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great! 
<phoebe> see? and you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone! 
<rachel> gone! i mean its amazing pheebs. i feel so free and so graceful.  hey! look out for the horse! sorry!  
< 
<monica> is it okay for me to come in now? 
<chandler> uh-huh 
<monica> why is everything different? 
<ross> bye!  
<chandler> no, i don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.  
<monica> well, the end table is wrong, the couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets. 
<chandler> okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? but after i unpacked the boxes i wanted to do something nice for you, so, i-i-i cleaned the apartment. so i moved everything around and then i forgot where it, where it went back and i'm sorry, i'm very sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry. 
<monica> it's okay. chandler, are you afraid of me or something? 
<chandler> do you want me to be afraid of you? 
<monica> of course not. i mean gosh, chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and i really appreciate it. i know i have this weird thing where i want everything to be in the perfect place, but i'd never expect you to worry about that. 
<chandler> really? 
<monica> of course! 
<chandler> oh well you're the best. you come here to me. 
<monica> all right, hold on okay? first thing's first.  okay, now did ross sit anywhere while he was naked? closing credits

<chandler> thats weird. i dont think my boss likes me either. 
<monica> i dont think mine likes me either. 
<ross> maybe its a universal thing?

<rachel> what? 
<phoebe> yeah, no, ralph doesnt look anything like that guy. hes-hes young and hes got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack. 
<rachel> oh my god, phoebe, thats not ralph lauren. thats kenny the copy guy. 
<phoebe> what? 
<rachel> oh..go..oh..and i told my boss that someone made out with ralph lauren. if she finds out that i lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. phoebe!! 
<phoebe> why would the copy guy say he was ralph lauren? 
<rachel> to get you to make out with him!!! 
<phoebe> ohhh. 
< 
<monica>  okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white.  nope. okay, colors that dont work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple. 
<ross> i dont know what im going to do. that date starts in like an hour. 
<monica> hey ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. your teeth wouldnt look so bright. 
<ross> oh great. so all i need to do is get some new skin. thank you. 
<monica> im just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you. 
<ross> whoa. whoa. whoa. were not 13 anymore. 
<monica> ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working. 
<ross> but, wont she notice i have makeup on? 
<monica> please. half the guys out there have makeup on. 
<ross> what?? 
<monica> all right, half the people. i mean, just try it and see.

<chandler> yes, god forbid we throw out old underwear. you-you know what? im going to go over to joeys. 
<monica> wait, were supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer. 
<chandler> yes, but i feel like ive really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. you know. in fact i think were two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple. 
<monica> you know what? this has been kind of a girlie day. youre right, im sorry. 
<chandler> nah, nah, its okay. i feel like i need to be in guy place. you know, do kind of like a man thing. 
<monica> yeah. go over to joeys. go over to joeys and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall. 
<chandler> you know when guys hang out they dont just drink some beer and hammer up drywall? 
<monica> when girls hang out, we dont have pillow fights in our underwear.  im sorry. we do. we do. i dont know why i said that. 
< 
<joey> hey chandler. come on in. were knitting pot holders. 
<chandler> no thanks, josephine. 
< 
<chandler> hey ross, i was wondering if oh my god!! where are all the men??? 
< 
<rachel> ohh, hi, kim. 
<s> hi rachel. 
<rachel> yeah, remember that thing i told you that happened yesterday? well it didnt happen. 
<s> you didnt cancel the fabric order from taiwan? 
<rachel> okay, two things didnt happen. remember i told you that someone made out with ralph lauren in the copy room? well, it turns out thats not true. 
<s> thats not true? 
<rachel> no. 
<s> oh thats interesting? because i checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, rachel. 
<rachel> oh no, no, no. oh god, you think i made out with him. 
<s> listen to me. if you think sleeping with ralph is going to get you my job. you are sadly mistaken. 
<rachel> i-i dont want your job. i-i dont. ohh this is such a mistake. i did not make out with him. nobody made out with him. i did not use my keycard yesterday. i dont even know how to use my keycard.  
<s> hi ralph. 
<s> yeah, nothing happen. you could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife. 
< 
<s> and after that, what could i do except become a chef. 
<ross> mmm-hmm. 
<s> and someday soon, i hope to open my own restaurant. 
<ross> mmm. 
<s> you know, youre a really great listener. most guys i go out with, they just talk and talk. 
<ross> mm-hmm. 
<s> after a while its like, shut your mouth, you know? 
<ross>  hmm-hmm. 
<s> ive probably been talking too much. why dont we talk about you a little bit? 
<ross> mmm-unmm. 
<s> come on. i want to know. 
<ross> hmm-hmm-hmm.  okay. i, uh, am from long island. i-i came to the city for college. um, i, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time i like to read spy novels. but, but, lets talk more about you. hmm. 
< 
<joey> so whats really neat. if you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer. 
<monica> oh my god, joey, that is such a great tip. 
<chandler> monica, could you excuse us for a second? i need to talk to the girl with the flowers. 
<monica> okay. oh but joey, come over later because im going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter. 
<joey> ohh, i love birds.  
<chandler> what is the matter with you ?!? 
<joey> what? 
<chandler> youre arranging flowers!  you got dead flowers! you got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! this is not joey!! 
<joey> hey. hey look i am still joey, okay. flowers theyre just, you know, theyre nice to look at. and that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. of a famous baby. 
<chandler> youre turning into a women. 
<joey> no im not. why would you say that? thats just mean. 
<chandler> now ive upset you? what did i say? 
<joey> its not what you said. its the way you said it .oh my god, im a women!!! 
< 
<rachel> now, she thinks that i made out with him and i did it to get her job. 
<phoebe> but why didnt you just tell her the truth. 
<rachel> i did but she doesnt think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse kenny the copy guy with ralph lauren. 
<phoebe> well, hey, what if kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? you know. what if kenny hired that ralph lauren guy to be the pretty front man? huh, did she ever think of that? 
<rachel> you were with kenny today, werent you? 
<phoebe> just for a second. 
<rachel> ohh, phoebe, what am i going to do? 
<phoebe> well, the only thing you can do. sleep with ralph lauren. 
<rachel> im not going to sleep with ralph lauren. i mean, i could, but i wouldnt. 
<phoebe> ohh, sleep with kenny. 
<rachel> that wouldnt help me. 
<phoebe> ohh, yes it would. 
< 
<s> ive had a really good time tonight. 
<ross> mmm. 
<s> you know, i rarely connect with someone this much on the first date. 
<ross>  hmm-hmm-hmm.  me, neither. ive had a really good time too, you know.  
<s> are you going to eat that bread? 
<ross>  ohh, i just like the smell.  mmmm. 
<s>  you make me laugh. 
<ross> hmm-hmm. 
<s> would you like to move over to the couch? 
<ross> mmm-hmm.  
<s> maybe ill just turn the lights down a little. 
<ross>  how about all the way. 
<s> okay.  
<ross>  wow, cool poster. or should i say groovy poster?  so, ahh, where were we? 
<s> are those your teeth?? 
<ross> ohh, you can see them, huh? 
<s> yes. theyre insanely white. 
<ross> i-i, did that for you. 
<s> whats a matter with you? 
<ross> whats a matter with me? youve got a black light. its 1999! 
< 
<rachel> kim, hi. 
<s> hi rachel. ohh, ive been meaning to ask you. have you seen the new ralph lauren sheets? ohh, what am i thinking. of course you have. 
<rachel> okay..okay.. look. im sorry that i lied to you before. you were right. ralph and i were an item but were not anymore. 
<s> oh, really? 
<rachel>  yeah, he dumped me. he said, "rachel, i cant do this. even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. i cant do this. im married and im sorry." and then i dont know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. especially not above kim, who is an integral cog in the ralph lauren machine." 
<s> you expect me to believe.. hi ralph. 
<s> oh my god. he just gave you the coldest look i have ever seen. its like he hates you. then it is true. 
<rachel> of course its true and it hurts so bad. 
<s> ohh honey come here.  ohh it will be ok. weve all been there. 
<rachel> you and ralph? 
<s> kenny the copyboy. ending credits 
< 
<s> hey. 
<joey> hey, uhh, i need to talk to you. 
<s> whats the matter? are you upset? 
<joey> im sorry but weve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. i, uh, i got to be a man! okay. the living room has to remain a guy place, okay? thats just the way it has to be. 
<s> well, if thats what you want. ill just put it all in my room. 
<joey> great great and thanks for being so understanding. i mean, i didnt want to make a big deal out of this, you know.  you could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. i mean, if you want to. 
<s> okay. 
<joey> and, uhh, maybe the watering can there. 
<s> sure. 
<joey> and a couple of these little tiny boxes. 
<s> joey? do you want me to put it all in your room? 
< 
<monica>  okay, great!  bye.  so guess whos coming to thanksgiving dinner? 
<chandler> sydney portier? hehheh.  
<monica>  i miss rachel.  no, my parents. 
<chandler> oh! thats great, they havent seen the place since i moved in!  
<monica> yeah, and yknow, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , i was thinking we would eat around four.  
<chandler>  why cant i tell them that we live together? 
<monica> because they dont know were dating.  do you think we should eat in the kitchen?  
<chandler> why havent you told them?! 
<monica> um, well, i was going to, i-i-i really was. but um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, i didnt. 
<chandler> why havent you told them?! wouldnt they be happy?! 
<monica>  so! dinner in the kitchen around four! ill see you then.  
<chandler> why wouldnt they be happy? 
<monica> well, um, because mainly, um, they dont like you. im sorry. 
<chandler> what? what? why?! 
<monica> maybe because you used to be aloof, or that youre really sarcastic, or that, yknow, you joke around all the time. or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch. 
<chandler> is this why they dont like me or why you dont like me? 
<monica> look, i know that i shouldve told them. i know i shouldnt care what they think. im sorry. 
<chandler> yknow, itll be okay. itll be okay. because when they come over, i will be all charming, i will make them fall in love with me, and then well tell em. 
<monica> you really think thatll work? 
<chandler> hey, i can be pretty charming, babe, i won you over, didnt i? 
<monica>  i dont think youll ever get my parents that drunk! opening credits 
< 
<chandler> hey!  oh, good, ross! youre parents like me, right?  
<ross>  yes, of course they like you! 
<chandler> well monica just told me that they dont. 
<ross>  yeah, they dont like you. 
<chandler>  do you know why? 
<ross> i dunno, maybe its because youre really sarcastic. or maybe its cause you uh- 
<chandler>  well if people dont know they shouldnt just guess!  
<chandler> this is great, another thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for. 
<joey> maybe i could give thanks for you shuttin up, eh? 
<chandler> maybe i could give thanks by taking my playstation over to my new apartment. 
<joey> well maybe i love ya. 
<chandler> .  
<chandler> hey.  
<s> hey guys!  
<ross>  no i dont want to play video games, joey!

<joey> yeah! yeah, why? whats up? 
<s> well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing thanksgiving uptown. i thought you guys might like to come. 
<ross> for real? 
<s> no, but you should go to chandlers. because none of us knows how to cook, well probably just end up drinking all day. 
<joey> ye-ye, we go to yours! 
<ross> yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because its my sister. but, uh, uh yknow actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. yeah, you-you should tell your friends that. 
<s>  okay.   
<joey> how you got three women to marry you, ill never know. 
< 
<phoebe> hey! 
<s> hey! 
<rachel> hey! hey, pheebs, check it out. yeah, for my desert, i have chosen to make a traditional english truffle! 
<phoebe> wow, that sounds great! and what are you making monica, in case rachels dessert is... so good that i eat all of it. theres none left for anybody else!  
<monica> nothing. 
<rachel>  nothing? 
<monica> no, sweetie, i-i trust you. 
<rachel> so, if-if i mess this up, theres nothing else for dessert? 
<monica> youre not gonna mess it up. 
<rachel> wow, monica, i love that, you really have faith in me. thank you. technical question, how do you know when uh, the butters done? 
<monica> well, its done about two minutes before it looks like that.  
<s> hey! 
<joey> oh, ooh the food smells great, mon! 
<ross> and the place looks so nice! 
<joey> yeah, hey hey, happy thanksgiving everybody! 
<ross> happy thanksgiving! 
<joey> well, this has been great! 
<ross> see ya!  
<monica> whoa whoa whoa! wherere you goin? 
<ross> oh, oh, we did say wed stop by this little thing joeys roommate is having. 
<monica> oh, janine, the really hot dancer girl? 
<ross> some would say shes attractive, yes. 
<phoebe> and who else is going to be there? 
<joey> uh, some of her friends, yeah. 
<rachel> her dancer friends? 
<joey>  yes, all right? all of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and theyre gonna be, be drinkin and dancin, and we really wanna go! 
<ross>  dude, we were good! 
<monica> youre not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and youre gonna eat here! 
<phoebe> yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very thanksgivingy. 
<ross> oh, but-but it is, uh, its just like the first thanksgiving, when the indians and the pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner. 
<joey> yeah, yeah, and the indians taught the pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!  
<s> hello everybody! 
<s> hi! 
<s> hi!  
<monica> dad , mom . look! look who it is its chandler! 
<s>  oh yes of course, hello chandler. 
<chandler> mr. and mrs._geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!  
<chandler> whoa, snowing out there? 
<s>  no. of the table, mr and mrs geller are to his right. joey and ross are to his left. monica is serving things. phoebe is in the living room and rachel is at the sink.] 
<s> monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living.  
<s> ok, i have dandruff. theres no need to laugh and point.  
<monica> dad, chandler was just laughing at your joke. 
<s> my joke wasnt funny.  
<phoebe> rach, rach, i just remembered. i had a dream about mr._geller last night. 
<rachel> really?! 
<phoebe> yeah, i dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! and its making me look at him totally differently. yknow, i mean he used to be just, yknow jack geller monica and rosss dad and now hes hes jack geller, dream hunk."  
<rachel> i dunno. yknow to me hell always be jack geller, walks in while youre changing. window. jack and chandler are sitting on the couch while monica sits on the coffee table.] 
<monica> yknow dad, chandler is one of rosss very best friends! 
<chandler> yeah, ross sure is a great guy, yknow ive always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father. 
<s> i always thought that too. tell me, what does your father do?  
<chandler>  hes the headliner of a gay burlesque show.  
<joey> rach, youre killin us here, will ya serve the dessert already? those drunken dancers are waiting! 
<rachel>  look at it, isnt it beautiful? 
<ross> yeah, yeah, what is it? 
<rachel> its a truffle. its got all of these layers. first theres a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which i made from scratch,  then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions,  then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then i just put some whipped cream on top!  
<ross> w-what was the one right before bananas? 
<rachel> the beef? yeah, that was weird to me, too. but then, yknow, i thought well, theres mincemeat pie, i mean thats an english dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, yknow.  oh! by the way, can i borrow some rum from your place? 
<joey> y-sure! 
<rachel>  and while im gone dont you boys sneak a taste.  
<ross> beef in a dessert?! i- no no no, there is no way!  
<joey> i know, and only one layer of jam?! what is up with that?  
<ross> oh my god, the pages are stuck together! 
<joey>  chandler! 
<ross> oh my god, she-she made half a english trifle, and half a...sheperds pie! 
<joey>  oh man! now shes gonna start all over! were never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world! 
<ross> no, no, we will. we just wont tell her she messed up. 
<joey> just let her serve the beef-custard thing? 
<ross> yeah, itll be like a funny thanksgiving story! 
<joey>  vomiting stories are funny...  
<rachel> joey, god, your apartment is like a hundred degrees! 
<joey> did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear? 
<rachel> no! 
<joey>  still not hot enough!   
<phoebe> rachel? 
<rachel> yeah? 
<phoebe> okay, look at him. look at those strong hands. oh what i wouldnt give to be that can of  condensed milk.   
<monica> mom, uh, chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is. 
<s> oh, thank you chandler! i just bought it. 
<chandler> oh, yes. well its very beautiful. its cream-colored and tight  i dont mean tight, i mean its not too tight, not that i was looking at- 
<s> whats the matter with him? 
<s>  i think hes stoned again. 
<chandler>  what? 
<monica>  what? 
<ross>  dude, i need to talk to you a sec.  
< 
<ross> okay, i think i might know why my parents dont like you. 
<chandler> you do? why? 
<ross> okay, remember, we were young. hey, spring break, sophomore year, i got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so i told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window. 
<chandler> what?! why did you do that? 
<ross> i dont know, aheh, yours was the first name that-that popped into my head, im im sorry. i-i didnt think it would matter. 
<chandler> how could it not matter?! 
<ross> how was i supposed to know wed end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister? 
<chandler> what about all that friends forever stuff? 
<ross> i dont know, i-i was all high. commercial break 
< 
<monica> mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you  were trying to get ross stoned! 
<chandler> your parents caught ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me! 
<monica> ross, i cant believe youd do that! 
<chandler> the reason we havent told them were together is because they hate me, okay? so will you fix this? 
<ross> okay, okay, ill tell em it wasnt chandler who got high. now who should i say it was? 
<monica> you! its not like its a big deal! you-you dont still do it or anything! 
<ross> alright, alright, now-now who should i say tricked me into doing it? 
< 
<monica> dad, please dont pick your teeth out here! alright, and if youre gonna put your feet up, why dont you sit on the- 
<phoebe> monica, leave him alone!  
<joey>  will you hurry up? did you not hear me before when i told you that all of janines friends are dancers?! and that theyre going to be drinking alot!? 
<rachel>  no, i did, but tell me again, because its so romantic. 
<joey> well youre whippin so slow! cant you do it any faster? 
<rachel> joey! come on! i dont wanna make any mistakes, alright? this is the only dessert and if i screw it up everybody's gonna be like oh, remember that thanksgiving when rachel screwed up the trifle?  
<rachel> so why dont you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright? 
<joey> oh i am!  
<monica> ross, if you dont tell them, then i will! 
<ross> okay, fine!   
<joey> ross! can i talk to you for a second? 
<ross> oh, uh, can it wait a second joey? i have to tell my parents something. no it cant? okay.  
< 
<joey> okay, look, i think we have to tell rachel she messed up her dessert. 
<ross> what?! what is with everybody? its thanksgiving, not...truth-day! 
<joey> look, when everyone eats that...that...banana-meat thing, theyre all gonna make fun of her, do you want that? 
<ross> okay, okay, well just get everyone to act like they like it. that-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to sweet potatoe pie!  
<joey>  dude, theyre not objects.  
<joey> just kiddin, ill talk to them, you distract rach.  
<ross> hey rach, can i talk to you outside for a second? 
<rachel> okay...  
<rachel> whats up, ross? 
<ross> so um...thanksgiving. the holiday season is upon us, hm? 
<rachel> yeah! 
<ross> and um...you look nice today. 
<rachel> oh no. no ross, dont do this. 
<ross> what? 
<rachel> i just- i dont think us getting back together is a good idea. 
<ross>  eh? 
<rachel> i thought this might happen today. ross, i know the holidays can be rough. yknow? and its probably really hard for you to be alone right now. 
<ross>  youre alone. 
<rachel> no, i-i live with phoebe. i mean youre  alone, alone. and i just-its just not the time for us. im sorry. 
<ross>  ah well, cant blame a guy for trying!  
<joey> oh and  okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, i learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach  or uh, or saying mmm and uh, oh oh! and smiling , okay? 
<chandler> yeah, im not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.  
<joey> rachel, there you are! come on, lets serve that dessert already! 
<rachel> joey, youre gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? you dont get any dessert. 
<joey>  really? 
<rachel> no, im just kidding i would never do that to you! okay, everybody, its trifle time! 
<phoebe> so, now, rach, this is a traditional english trifle, isnt it? 
<rachel> it sure is. 
<phoebe> wow. so then did you make it with beef or eggplant? 
<rachel> beef. 
<phoebe> i cant have any. you know i dont eat meat.  ohhh no.  
<rachel> alright, monica, i want you to have the first taste. 
<monica> really?  
<rachel> oh oh oh, wait! you only got whipped cream in there! ya gotta take a bite with all the layers! 
<monica> okay.  
<rachel> op! wait, you dropped a pea.  
<rachel> well? 
<monica>  mmmm! its good! 
<rachel> really? how good? 
<monica> its so good, that i feel really selfish about being the only one whos eating it, that i think we should have everyone taste how good it is. especially ross.   
<s>  mmm. 
<chandler>  yeah, this is so good, that im gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that i can enjoy the view whilst i enjoy my dessert.  
<s>  ive gotta call my friend mary and tell her how good this is, from monicas room. 
<s>  ill help you dial.  
<monica>  im gonna go into the bathroom so i can look at it in the mirror, as i eat it.  
<rachel> okay, now what was that all about? is it-does it not taste good? let me try it.  
<ross> wha? no no! ah!  all gone! so good! maybe chandler has some left.  
<ross> it tastes like feet! 
<joey> i like it. 
<ross> are you kidding? 
<joey> whats not to like? custard? good. jam? good. meat? gooooood.  
<rachel> ...so a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?  
<chandler>  yes, but if its any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.  
<phoebe> rachel, come here.  okay, i was just starting to take my thanksgiving nap, and i had another dream about jack. 
<rachel> oh, phoebe, do i wanna hear this? 
<phoebe> i dunno, lets see! so, okay, i dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. and, um, so okay, i went to a night club, and i saw him making out with a girl. 
<rachel>  oh my god, he dream-cheated on you! 
<phoebe> yeah, but then jacques cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! it was soo cool! then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.  
<s> boy, im glad i wore the big belt today. 
<phoebe> five minutes ago, a line like that wouldve floored me. now nothing. well, not nothing, i am still a woman.  
<monica> ross? lets go. 
<ross> oh yeah, about telling mom and dad, i was thinking about maybe writing a letter. 
<monica> alright, you know what? thats it. youve had your chance. 
<ross> wha-what? 
<monica>  mom! dad! ross smoked pot in college! 
<ross>  you are such a tattletale! mom, dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana? 
<ross> well i told you it was chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. im sorry. 
<s> it was you? 
<monica> and dad, yknow that mailman that you got fired? he didnt steal your playboys! ross did!  
<ross> yeah, well, hurricane gloria didnt break the porch swing, monica did!   
<monica> ross hasnt worked at the museum for a year!  
<ross> monica and chandler are living together!   
<monica> ross married rachel in vegas! and got divorced! again!!!!  
<phoebe>  i love jacques cousteau! 
<rachel>  i wasnt supposed to put beef in the trifle! 
<joey>  i wanna gooooooo! 
<s>  thats alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! alright joey, if wanna leave, just leave. rachel, no you werent supposed to put beef in the trifle. it did not taste good. phoebe, im sorry, but i think jacques cousteau is dead.  monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me. 
<s> and we kinda figured about the porch swing. 
<s> ross, drugs? divorced? again? 
<s> what happened son? 
<ross> i-i uh, i got tricked into all those things! 
<s> chandler! youve been rosss best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems.  and now youve taken on monica as well. well, i dont know what to say. youre a wonderful human being.  
<chandler> thank you! 
<s> no! thank you!  monica, and ross! i dont know what im gonna do about the two of you! 
<chandler>  ill talk to them! closing credits 
< 
<rachel> you guys! it was bananas, cream, and beef! i-i just cannot believe that you ate that so that i wouldnt feel bad! 
<monica> well actually, i-i didnt eat mine. its still in the bathroom. 
<joey> no it isnt, i ate that. 
<s>  well we left ours in monicas bedroom. 
< 
<chandler> let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? i remember when people used to use big lights. 
<rachel> thats a good story, grandpa.  
<ross> hey 
<s> hey 
<ross> wow, monicas letting other people help decorate her tree! did someone get her drunk again or? 
<monica> having a perfectly decorated tree is not what christmas is about. its about being with the people that you love. 
<phoebe> that is nice and were done. tada!  
<chandler> i dunno what it is, it just doesnt quite feel like christmas to me. 
<monica> oh, here.  
<chandler> see now it feels like christmas! opening credits 
< 
<ross> and thats the story of the dreidle. now, some people trace the christmas tree back to the egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising lifes triumph over death. and that was like 4000 years ago. 
<rachel> so, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.  
<joey> hey you guys. 
<chandler> hey joe whats up? 
<joey> i had to get out of the apartment. janine is like stretching all over the place. yknow, everywhere i look shes like  
<chandler> i can see why thats hard to resist. 
<joey> i like her so much! 
<monica> aw, im sorry sweetie that she doesnt feel the same way. 
<joey> i know. and shes so sweet. i just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair. 
<chandler> you are aware that shes not a monkey, right? 
<ross> i am so over janine. i mean, yeah, at first i thought she was hot, but now shes like old news!  
<s> hey guys! 
<ross> hi janine! 
<s> i just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for new years eve. its called some sort of dickn rockn dickie eve. 
<monica> hold it! are you talking about dick clarks new years rocking eve? 
<s> yeah, thats what i said. 
<monica> oh my god! we love that show! i mean ross and i have been watching it since i can remember! 
<chandler> ah, youre still just a little fat girl inside arent you?  
<s> well im gonna be on it this year. im gonna be one of the party people. 
<ross> youre gonna be a party person! those guys rock the most! 
<s> well they said i should bring someone.  do you wanna be my dance partner? 
<joey> totally! i would love to spend new years with you. 
<s> well actually theyre taping tomorrow. i dont really understand why. 
<ross> oh, well you see how it works is, the part with dick clark in times square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. yeah, not a lot of people know that. 
<s> yeah well, do you guys wanna come too? 
<ross> are you serious? 
<monica> we are there!  
<chandler> what, what are you laughing at? 
<rachel> well, i used to date him, but youre still going out with her!  
<s> thanks.  great so we can all go together! i gotta run. catch you later!  
<s> bye! 
<ross> bye janine! 
<joey> did she just ask me out on a date? 
<chandler> i dont think so. 
<monica> what are you talking about? she just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium! 
<rachel> yeah, but she also invited you and ross. yeah, honey, im sorry, but i dont think that was a romantic thing. 
<joey> oh. maybe. but hey i know how i can find out. were going to a new years eve party, right? so at midnight, i can kiss her. and if she kisses me back, great! yknow? but if she says dude, what the hell are you doing? i can say it wasnt me, it was new years! 
<rachel> well, thats a lot better than ross trying to kiss me in high school, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick. 
<ross> it was a dry day. 
<monica> we are going to dick clarks new years rocking eve! 
<ross> oh my god! 
<monica> oh my god! 
<chandler>  oh my god! 
< 
<joey> ok, listen ive been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? its a show, but were just dancing, ok? its no big deal. the important thing to remember  stay cool. 
<ross> got it!  
<ross> oh my god its just like i dreamed it! 
<s> ok, everyone gather up.  
<s> heres whats gonna happen. the musics gonna start, youre gonna dance, were gonna tape, you dont look at the camera. any questions?

<phoebe> yeah, chandler why dont you take a walk? this doesnt concern you. 
<rachel> we are looking for our christmas presents from monica. 
<chandler> what? thats terrible! 
<phoebe> no-no, we do it every year! 
<chandler> oh well, that makes it not terrible. 
<phoebe> no, yeah, we never find them! shes always best at us that wily minx. 
<rachel> dont worry, were just gonna search here for an hour, them were gonna go over to joeys and search, ok? 
<chandler> no not okay, you cant look for monicas presents! 
<phoebe> but we have to! 
<chandler> no, you dont have to, and you cant because i live here too. 
<phoebe> well then, you should look with us. 
<chandler> why? 
<rachel> chandler, arent you worried about what to get monica for christmas? 
<chandler> no, i have a great idea for a present for her. 
<phoebe> oh, thats it?  a great idea! 
<rachel> chandler, thats not enough. i mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? and youve just gotten her one great present? i mean thats just gonna make her feel bad. why would you do that to her chandler? why? why? 
<chandler> if i help, we can find em faster! 
<rachel> thats right!  
<phoebe> ooh ooh, we have a live one! 
<rachel> oh, its a macys bag!  
<phoebe> ooh, whos it for?

<phoebe> uh-oh. she may be onto us. 
<rachel> we are so gonna find them this year. 
<chandler> yknow when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you dont, you dont do that every year do you? 
<rachel> yeah. 
<chandler> you dont, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?  
<chandler> because thats where joey gave me some stuff to store that ive never seen before in my life! okay, that did not just happen!  
< 
<monica> okay, here comes another camera. 
<ross> right. no biggie. stay loose.  
<ross> why do they keep doing that? 
<monica> if we wanna get on camera, i think we have to get up on one of those platforms. theyve been taping those people up there all day. 
<ross> right.  
<ross> hey, whatd you guys do to get up on there? 
<s> we learned how to dance.

<chandler> you took off your pants and climbed under the sheets! 
<joey>  i was tired! 
<rachel> phoebe hates pottery barn?! 
<monica> yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. she thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it. 
<rachel> well this has story behind it! i mean they had to ship it all the way from the white plains store. 
<monica> its gotta be one of a kind. yknow like umm, yknow uh, whats that god awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter? 
<joey> hey! i made that for her! 
<chandler> you made pottery? 
<joey> yeah! i made it of this fruit bowl i found in the garbage. 
<monica> im tellingif you put that in her apartment youll never hear the end of it. 
<rachel> okay fine! ill-ill just tell her its an antique apothecary table, she doesnt have to know where it came from. oh! look at this little drawers! oh look-look it says that it holds 300 cds. 
<chandler> ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore 
< 
<chandler> so then the farmer says, "thats not a cow and youre not milking it."  
<monica> i am so glad you guys got together, chandler and i are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!

<phoebe> umm, a flea market? 
<rachel> ha! see, i knew, i knew youd get it on the first guess. isnt it cool! its an apothecary table. 
<phoebe> wow! oh you can just imagine that this is where  they kept all the stuff to make their potions. 
<rachel> ohh, yes. 
<phoebe> yknow? ooh, you can almost smell the opium. 
<rachel> almost. 
<phoebe> how much was it? 
<rachel> it was only 500 bucks. 
<phoebe> 500 bucks at a flea market?! 
<rachel> oh, okay see i thought, i thought you meant how much was it when it was new, yknow like back then. 
<phoebe> oh no. 
<rachel> yeah no, i mean it was at a flea market, so it was yknow, it was like a dollar. 
<phoebe> a dollar? 
<rachel> and fifty. so it was like one and fifty dollars. 
<phoebe> ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.

<phoebe> well, what period is it from? 
<rachel> uh, its from yore. like the days of yore. yknow?

<rachel> i know you did! i bought the same one! and if she sees your table shes gonna know that i lied to her. i told her ours was an original. 
<ross> why did you do that? 
<rachel> because she hates pottery barn. 
<ross> she hates pottery barn?!! 
<rachel> i know! i know, she says its all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff.  so come on, shes gonna be here any second! can we please just cover this up with something?! please? 
<ross> what? no! no! i am not gonna hide it from phoebeooh, although i did get some great pottery barn sheets!

<ross> uh, yeah! i still cant believe she hates pottery barn! 
<rachel> ross, get over it! its not like she hates you. 
<ross> yeah but pottery barn! yknow what i think? its just she-shes weird. yknow its because shes a twin. twins are weird.

<rachel> oh my god, phoebe, pottery barn has ripped off the design of our antique! 
<phoebe> wow! oh my god, well if theyve ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars! 
<rachel> oh yes. 
<phoebe> well this doesnt even smell like opium. 
<ross> of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! and thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way. 
<phoebe> oh ross, calm down, ill give you the 80 cents.  
< 
<chandler> okay, one more time. 
<monica> chandler, would you like some more orange juice? 
<chandler> perfect decibel. 
<monica>  i know!!! 
<joey>  hey! 
<chandler> hey. 
<joey> so uh, what are you guys doing? 
<chandler> oh nothing, were just talking. yknow, blah-blah-blah. 
<joey> look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! all right look, i came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and janine. 
<monica> well, id like to but,  im not sure we have time to go. 
<joey> ha-ha, very funnylook! i dont know what to do! i really want you guys to get along. just please come to the movie with us. i mean you owe me! 
<monica> we owe you?! 
<joey> thats right! i helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. huh? i helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and i looked like an idiot! and i was humiliated. and i only made 200 dollars! 
<monica> we didnt give you any money!  
<joey> you dont think i know that! 
< 
<rachel> see i cant decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the sahara desk, or the parker console table. 
<ross> wow! i didnt know that there was a pottery barn up here. 
<rachel> i know, i know. i went a little crazy. 
<ross> a little? your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. oh look at that! the ornamental bird cage! large! 
<phoebe>  hey! 
<rachel> hey. 
<phoebe>  oh ross no. be careful, that is very old! okay? early colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that. 
<ross>  fascinating. 
<phoebe>  another amazing find! wow! oh i bet this has a great story too! 
<rachel> oh it does, it does! it is a room separating apparatus from colonial times. 
<phoebe> ah! 
<ross> hmm, a lot of this stuff is from colonial times. hey, what are some other time periods rachel?  
<rachel> well theres yore. and uh, yknow, yesteryear. 
<phoebe> yeah no, im telling you rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. ross, yknow if you ever decide you need to redecorateand i think that you should. you should, you should ask rachel to help. 
<rachel> oh honey he doesnt need my help. 
<phoebe> oh, come on! i think hes ready to get rid of, what did you call it? the cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk. 
<ross> really?!  hey, yknow what? since you have such a great sense of what i need, uh ooh, heres-heres 60 bucks, why dont you take phoebe down to that colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff. 
<rachel>  yknow what? i dont, i dont think phoebe really wants to come. 
<phoebe> no! i do want to! 
<rachel> oh, she does want to. 
<ross> she does want to. 
<phoebe> yeah! 
< 
<rachel> pheebs, i dont know what to say. i guess the flea market was just better last time. 
<phoebe> well at least i got these sheets for ross. 
<rachel> yeah.  
<phoebe> uck, look at this! pottery barn, yuck! 
<rachel> yeah, yknow what? dont look at it.  seriously, dont look at it.  
<phoebe> no! look-look! theres the coffee table they stole from us! 
<rachel> ugh, those bastards! lets go. 
<phoebe> that fan kinda looks like ours. and the birdcage and the wait a sec! this is our exact living room! 
<rachel> no! no! no! no its not! no its not! come on! phoebe, ours is totally different! i mean we dont have the  we dont have the that lamp! and-and that screen is yknow, on the other side. 
<phoebe> oh my god. this is where you got all our stuff, pottery barn! oh my god! 
<rachel> okay! okay-okay lookno i did, i just wanted this stuff and i know how you feel about pottery barn. just come on dont be mad. 
<phoebe> no-no-no, but i am mad! i am mad! because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! and its all sitting up in my living room and all i can think about is how i dont have that lamp! 
<rachel> well then honey, buy the lamp! hey, we have that 60 bucks from ross. 
<phoebe> i cant! i cant! unless well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if i didnt buy that lamp? 
<rachel> what?! no! im not gonna move out! 
<phoebe> but are you saying that you would move out if i didnt buy that lamp? 
<rachel>  oh. yes! i would so move out! 
<phoebe> okay then i dont have a choice! i have to buy that lamp! 
<rachel> thats right!  
<phoebe> but at least the apothecary table is real. 
< 
<joey> well, this-this-this was great. didnt everybody have a great time? 
<s> well i did. i really did. and you guys, ive got to say, im sorry if i was a little weird after the last time we went out. i guess i was just nervous or something. 
<chandler> thats totally understandable. 
<monica> dont worry about it. 
<s> so we can go out again? 
<chandler> oh yeah! 
<monica> absolutely! 
<s> oh good. 
<joey> oh well then, good night! 
<monica> good night!

<s> we have got to move! 
<monica>  i knew it!! yknow, youre not so quiet yourself, missy! 
<chandler> and im blah? listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it,  "oh chandler, i just lost myself in the moment." 
<s> yknow, i know youre talking, but all i hear is, "blah. blah. blah-blah-blah." 
<monica>  all right! you and me! lets go! right now! 
<joey> all right! all right! enough! enough! enough!! enough!  you two go home! i-i-i gotta talk to janine!  
<chandler>  yknow i think you can take her. 
<monica>  youd better hope i dont see you in the hallway!!  
<joey> all right, uh, weve got a little bit of a problem here. these people are my friends; you cant treat them that way. 
<s> they said stuff to me too, yknow! 
<joey> i know! i know! and im going to talk to them about it. they mean so much to me. they theyre like my family. if you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, i-i i dont think we can be together. it just, it just cant work. it cant.  im very upset. 
<s> okay. okay. would, would it help if i went over and apologized? 
<joey> yeah! yeah! that would be very helpful! yeah.   
<monica> what did i tell you about the hall?! 
<s> i was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! id really like it if we could be friends. 
<monica> well, i know that would make joey happy, so, i would like that too. 
<s> great.

<ross> hey! 
<joey> how ya doin? 
<chandler> hey so, did uh, did she move out? 
<joey> pretty much, yeah. 
<monica> i cannot believe you broke up with her just like that. 
<joey> well, when its not right, you know it. 
<chandler> you okay? 
<joey> yeah! yeah. ill be all right. 
<ross> yknow what would cheer you up? 
<joey> what? 
<ross> im giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, i think you should come. 
<joey>  youre right! that did cheer me up! 
< 
<ross> hey, youre not going to believe this. i made up a joke and sent it in to playboy. they printed it! 
<phoebe> i didnt know playboy prints jokes. 
<ross> yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. its not just about the pictures. 
<monica> that didnt work on mom, its not going to work on us. 
<ross>  here, check it out. its the first one, too.  
<chandler> that is funny. it was also funny when i made it up. 
<ross> what? 
<chandler> i made that joke up. 
<ross> uh, oh-oh, no you didnt. i did. 
<chandler> yes, i did. i told it to dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke hed ever heard. 
<ross> hey, tell dan, thanks.  
<ross> what? 
<rachel> im sorry, i was just reading the joke below it. man, that one is funny.  
<chandler> monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right? 
<monica> no. 
<chandler> seriously? 
<monica> well, you tell a lot of jokes! 
<ross> look, chandler, its my joke. but, hey, if it makes you feel any better they dont print the name, so it doesnt really matter who gets credit, right? 
<chandler> yeah, i guess. 
<joey>  hey guys. 
<chandler>  hey, joey, playboy printed my joke. 
<ross> no, its my joke, its mine. you can call them, theyll tell you. 
<chandler> its my joke. 
<ross> its my joke. 
<joey> whoa-whoa-whoa. jokes? you guys know they have naked chicks in there, right? opening credits 
< 
<chandler> dude, you have got to turn on behind the music. the band heart is having a really tough time, and i think they may break up. 
<joey> lets go watch it at your place. 
<chandler> nah, monicas watching some cooking show. come on, i dont want to miss when they were skinny. 
<joey> chandler, chandler, yknow what we should do? you and i should go out and get some new sunglasses. 
<chandler> what? no, i want to watch this. . did your cable go out? 
<joey> no, thats vh-1. i gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . its like a lotta noise to me. i dont know 
<chandler> joey, why is your cable out? 
<joey> i uh, oh! because, uh, i havent really paid the bill 
<chandler> if you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money? 
<joey> no, chandler. look, forget about it, okay? look, i know things have been a little tight since janine moved out. oh, was she hot. 
<chandler> whoa ho. 
<joey> i know! yeah, but, look i can handle it. all right? look, i can listen to the radio, huh? and ross gave me this great book . 
<chandler>  all right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place? 
<joey> sure. 
<chandler>  paid your phone bill? 
<joey> not so much. 
< 
<phoebe>  hey. 
<monica>  its only you. 
<phoebe> wh-wh-what are you doing? 
<rachel> we are looking at a playboy. 
<phoebe> oh, i want to look too! . yikes! 
<monica> so do you think that these picturesare, are they trying to tell a story? 
<rachel> oh, yeah, sure. i mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, shes crying out, where are they, where are they? 
<monica> well, shes not going to find them lying in the grass like that.  
<phoebe> oh, yeah. aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over? 
<rachel> you see, now, i would date this girl. shes cute, shes outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. i mean, thats got to come in handy 
<monica> okay, ive got a question. if you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be? 
<rachel>  i dont know. 
<monica> me neither. 
<phoebe> rachel. 
<monica> what?! 
<phoebe> i dont know.  me neither. 
< 
<joey> you forget how many great songs heart had. 
<chandler> yeah. 
<ross> you know, barracuda was the first song i learned to play on the keyboard. 
<chandler> so, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it. 
<joey> oh, you guys, with this joke. i gotta say, i know i cracked up, but im not even sure i got it. 
<ross> what, you didnt get it? the doctor is a monkey.  
<chandler> and monkeys cant write out prescriptions.  
<chandler>  you are not allowed to laugh at my joke. 
<ross> your joke? well, i think the hef would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars. 
<chandler> so, you stole my joke, and you stole my money. 
<ross> well, i was going to stick it in the atm, but now i think ill show the sexy teller that i am a published writer. 
<chandler> well, she is going to know that you stole the joke. 
<ross> oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there? 
<chandler> yeah! 
<ross> well, im not going to go now anyway . 
<chandler> okay .  
<s>  here you go. 
<joey> ah, gunther, i cant pay for this right now because im not working, so ive had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin for stuff. 
<s> well, if you want, you can work here. 
<joey> uh, i dont know. ya see, its just, see i was a regular on a soap opera yknow? and to go from that to this, i just plus, id have to wait on all my friends. 
<s> okay, but the moneys good, plus you get to stare at rachel as much as you want. 
<joey> what?! 
<s> flexible hours. 
<joey> maybe i could be a waiter. could i use the phone? 
< 
<monica>  she picked rachel. i mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. she picked rachel. 
<chandler>  he took my joke, he took it. 
<monica> its wrong. you know what else is wrong? phoebe picking rachel. 
<chandler> you know who else picked rachel? ross, and you know what else ross did? he stole my joke. you know what? im going to get a joke journal. yknow? and document the date and time of every single one of my jokes. 
<monica> thats a good idea. 
<chandler> yeah! 
<monica> do you know whats a bad idea? 
<chandler> picking rachel. 
<monica> thats right.  did you hear something? 
<chandler> maybe its the sound of ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts. 
<monica> its coming from the living room.  
<joey>  i finished my book.   
<monica>  hey, you guys. 
<monica>  oh, dont you guys look cute. you guys make such a cute couple. 
<rachel> monica, what are you doing? 
<monica>  nothing, im just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day.  remember, when you picked rachel over me? that was funny. 
<phoebe> i guess it was kinda funny. 
<monica>  it wasnt funny at all! why would you do that? why didnt you pick me? 
<phoebe> fine. the reason that i was leaning a little bit more toward rachel than you is just that youre just kinda high maintenanceokay lets go to lunch! 
<monica> that is completely untrue. you think im high maintenance? okay, prove it. i want you to make a list and were going to go through it point by point! 
<phoebe> no, okay, youre right. youre easy-going. youre just not as easy-going as rachel. shes just more flexible and-and mellow. thats all. 
<rachel>  well, people are different. 
<phoebe> ya, you know, rachel shell do whatever you want. yknow, you can just walk all over her.

<chandler> so is your apron. youre wearing it like a cape. 
<joey> i mean, the jobs easy and the moneys good, you know? i guess im going to be hanging out here anyway. i might as well get paid for it, right? i just feel kind of weird serving you guys. 
<rachel> come on, joey, i did it and it was fine. 
<ross> yeah, why would it be weird? hey, joey, can i get some coffee? 
<joey> okay, i guess it doesnt seem that weird.

<joey> thanks, rach. look, you guys are just terrific. yknow? now, how about clearing out of here so i can get some new customers. its all about turnover.

< 
<rachel> phoebe. we would like to talk to you for a second. 
<phoebe> okay. 
<monica> so, maybe i am a little high maintenance. and maybe rachel is a little bit of a pushover. but you know what we decided you are? 
<rachel> yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, phoebe, are flaky. 
<monica> hah! 
<phoebe> that true, i am flaky. 
<rachel> so, what, youre just, youre just okay with being flaky? 
<phoebe> yeah, totally. 
<monica> well, then, im okay with being high maintenance. 
<rachel> yeah, and i am okay with being a pushover. 
<phoebe> thats great. good for you guys. 
<monica> i am not high maintenance! 
<rachel> i am not a pushover! 
<phoebe> who said you were? 
<phoebe> oh, im flaky. ill say anything. 
< 
<joey> hey, gunther. can you uh, can you cover for me? i just got an audition. 
<s> no, im leaving to get my hair dyed. 
<joey> really?! i like your natural color. come on man, its a great part. look, check it out. im the lead guys best friend and i wait for him in this bar and save his seat. listen-listen. im sorry, that seats saved. 
<s> thats the whole part? 
<joey> okay, maybe hes not his best friend, but 
<s> okay, ill see you in an hour. 
<joey> oh, man, i could totally get that part. im sorry, that seat is taken. 
<s> oh, excuse me. 
<joey> no, no, i didnt mean you. but, you believed me, huh? 
<s> i believed you were saving this seat for someone. 
<joey> so, youd hire me, right? 
<s> for what? 
<joey> exactly! all right, everybody, listen up. the coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour. 
<s> huh? what? 
<joey> yeah, its for the kids. to keep the kids off drugs. its a very important issue in this months playboy. im sure you all read about it. 
< 
<ross> its my joke. 
<chandler> its my joke. 
<ross> yknow, i dont think were going to settle this. 
<chandler> lets have monica decide. 
<ross> yeah! 
<chandler> yeah! 
<ross> hey mon. 
<chandler> mon, get out here! 
<ross> monica!  
<chandler> okay, okay. you have to help us decide whose joke this is. 
<monica> why do i have to decide? 
<chandler> because youre the only one that can be fair. 
<ross> yeah. 
<monica> i cant be fair. youre my boyfriend. 
<ross> yeah, but im your brother. were family. thats the most important thing in the world. 
<chandler>  dont try to sway her.  im your only chance to have a baby. okay, lets go. 
<ross> well each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truthme. 
<monica> okay, chandler, you go first. 
<chandler> okay, i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve. 
<monica> oh, wait, is he the guy i met at christmas? 
<chandler> can i finish my story?! 
<monica> do you want me to pick you?! 
<ross> see, i would never snap at you like that.  
<monica> continue. 
<chandler> so steve said he had to go to the doctor. and steves doctors name is doctor muppy. so i said, doctor monkey? and that is how the whole doctor monkey thing came up.  
<ross> are you kidding? okay, look. i-i studied evolution. remember, evolution? monkey into man? plus, im a doctor, and i had a monkey. im doctor monkey! 
<chandler> im not arguing with that. 
<monica> all right, ive heard enough. ive made my decision.  
<monica> you are both idiots. the joke is not funny, and its offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! you shouldnt be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! now let it go! the joke sucks!  
<ross> its your joke. 
<chandler> is not. 
< 
<monica> hi, chandler. there you are. 
<chandler> hi, oh hi. 
<monica> hey, its phoebe and rachel. um, why dont you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?  
<chandler>  monica is a self-sufficient, together lady.  being with her has been like being on a vacation. and what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail andgenerosity of spirit. 
<rachel> wow, you know what? that is the best fake speech i think ive ever heard. 
<phoebe> really? ive heard better. 
<monica> wait, wait, he came up with that himself. tell them, chandler. 
<chandler>  im out of words. should i just say the whole thing again? 
<monica> look, i am not high maintenance. i am not. chandler! 
<chandler>  youre a little high maintenance. 
<monica> ahhh! you are on my list. 
<chandler> im sorry. youre not easy-going, but youre passionate, and thats good. and when you get upset about the little things, i think that im pretty good about making you feel better about that. and thats good too. so, they can say that youre high maintenance, but its okay, because i like maintaining you. 
<monica>  i didnt even tell him to say that. . all right youre off my list. 
<chandler>  im off the list.  
<monica>  phoebe, its okay that you dont want me to be your girlfriend because i have the best boyfriend. 
<phoebe>  yknow, suddenly i find you very attractive.  
<chandler> hey, buddy boy, howd the audition go? 
<joey> not good, no. i didnt get the part, and i lost my job here, so 
<phoebe> wow! that is a bad audition. 
<rachel> how-how did you lose your job here? 
<joey> well, i had the audition but gunther said i had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. so, i went anyway, and then he fired me. 
<rachel> he left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when youve been working here two days? thats not, thats not right. 
<joey> yeah, what are ya gonna do? 
<rachel> joey, you cant let him get away with that. ya know what, im not going to let him get away with that. im going to say something to himno, i really shouldnt say anythingno, i should say something to him.  gunther, i want you to give joey his job back. that is really not fair that you have to fire him 
<s> okay. 
<rachel> what? 
<s> he can have his job back. 
<rachel> thats right, he can have his job back. im glad we got that all straightened out. there you go, joey, you got your job back. 
<joey> thats great. thanks rach. 
<rachel> yeah, pretty nice, huh? now whos a pushover?

<s> well, i wouldnt call her a star, but shes really good. you should check out inspecther gadget. 
< 
<s> hey! 
<rachel> hey! 
<s> youll never believe what just happened, ross just totally blew me off and he didnt even tell me why! 
<rachel> ohhh well. yknow what honey? the best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. oh! there is this great guy you will love at work named bob! hes a real up-and-comer in human resources. 
<s> yknow, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but im not gonna date some random guy from your work. 
<rachel> its not random, its bob. 
<s> its probably because not mature enough. or smart enough. maybe he doesnt like the way i dressno that cant be it. its really gotta be the smart thing. oh im so stupid! im just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl! 
<rachel> no honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why ross canceled the date? because i asked him to. 
<s> you asked him too?! 
<rachel> hm-mmm. 
<s> why?! 
<rachel> because you are my sister and ross and i have this huge history 
<s> i dont understand, do you want to go out with ross? 
<rachel> no. 
<s> you dont want him, but you dont want me to have him? 
<rachel>  yknow bob in human resources 
<s> ugh! i cannot believe you did this too me! you had me doubting how smart i was!  you had me doubting my fashion sense! 
<rachel> look, this is not that big of a deal! you just dont date ross! theres a million other guys out there, you just 
<s> hey! you have no right to tell me what to do. 
<rachel> im not telling you what to do! i am telling you what not to do! 
<s> why are you so jealous of me? 
<rachel> jill this is not about me being jealous of you! this is about you being a brat! wanting what you cant have! 
<s> cant have?! excuse me, the only thing i cant have is dairy!  
<rachel> all right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating bob! 
<s> who?! 
<rachel> in human resources!!!!!! 
< 
<rachel> i am jealous of her?! i mean who does she think she is?! princess caroline?! 
<monica> youre jealous of princess caroline? 
<rachel> do i have my own castle?  
<ross> hey! uh, phoebes not here is she? 
<rachel> no. 
<monica>  oh great! did you get a movie? 
<joey> uhhh, yeah. yeah. but uh, i dont think its the kind youre gonna like. 
<chandler> you didnt get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?  
<joey> sort of 
<monica> guys, whats going on? 
<joey>  phoebes a porn star! 
<s> what?!!  
<chandler> phoebe buffay in buffay 
<rachel> oh my god! 
<monica> thats phoebe! where did you get that? 
<joey> well down at the adult video place down on bleaker. 
<ross> and-and i, and i saw that joey was about to go in, so i ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then i pretended i didnt know he was in there.  
<rachel> wow! i mean, i justi cant, i cant believe this. yknow, i mean you think you know someone even, even phoebe whos always been somewhat of a question mark. 
<monica> this is so bizarre. i guess it kinda makes sense though, yknow she had such a terrible childhood. 
<chandler> hey, i had a terrible childhood and i dont do porn. 
<monica> yes, but you are dead inside. 
<joey> all right well, id better take that back. 
<monica> wh-what, why? 
<joey> we cant watch that! i mean thats phoebe! 
<monica> yeah youre right, we cantwe shouldnt watch this. 
<rachel> absolutely not. 
<monica>  yknow maybe a little bit! 
<rachel> probably just the first half. 
<joey> no! hey no! this is wrong you guys! phoebes our friend! well, im not gonna watch it! 
<ross> yeah! good for you joe! 
<joey> yeah.   
<monica> hold on a second! what is that on her ankle? 
<chandler> her ankle is what youre watching? 
<rachel> well its hard to tell  oh god, if she would just stop moving. 
<chandler> shes just doing her job! 
<joey>  you sick bastards! 
<rachel> oh, its a tattoo! thats weird, phoebe doesnt wait thats ursula! thats not phoebe that is ursula!  
<joey> re! re! then i can watch that! rewind it! rewind it! 
<phoebe>  hey! whats up?  oh my god! what am i doing?!! commercial break 
< 
<monica> hey sweetie! 
<chandler> hey!  
<monica>  chicken soup for the soul? 
<chandler> theres no back to this couch! 
<monica> why are you reading this? you hate this kind of stuff. 
<chandler> yeah i know, but i figured a shot yknow? maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldnt think i was yknow, all dead inside. 
<monica> oh thats so sweet! look chandler i dont care if you cant cry, i love you. 
<chandler> oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest. 
<monica> stop it! 
<chandler> no, i mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, were up at the altar and im like this.  
<monica> i wont care, because i know you will be feeling it all in here.  
<chandler> yeah? 
<monica> yeah! and if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you dont cry, so what! and-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it wont matter to me. 
<chandler> okay, well i wont uh, worry about this anymore then. 
<monica> and-and-and if i die, from a long illness. and youre writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "i will always be with you," and you still cant shed one tiny tear, i know youll be crying a river inside. 
<chandler> aww, i love you so 
<monica> what is wrong with you?!!! 
<chandler> what?! 
<monica> what?! you cant shed a tear for your dead wife!! now, i left you a note from the beyond! 
<chandler> so you didnt mean any of that?! 
<monica> no you robot!! 
< 
<ross> you damn kids! you ring my bell one more time, i swear to  ohh, uh jill. umm, that-thats just a little game i play with the kids down the hall. umm, theyve really taken a liking to me.  uhh whats-whats-whats the matter? 
<s> rachel and i had a really big fight, can i come in? i-i mean i know were not supposed to see each other anymore and im okay with that, its just that i dont know anybody in the city and i really need somebody to talk to about it. 
<ross> of course, what happened?  
<s>  i dont want to talk about it. 
<ross> okay, umm 
<s> but you know what might really cheer me up? 
<ross> what? 
<s> seeing some more of your super-cool slides. 
<ross> wow! really?! 
<s> totally, i love them! and, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand. 
<ross> well, id love to! here, you wait right here and ill go get the projector and my notes! 
<s> oh great! thanks ross, youre such a good friend! 
<ross> ohh! (he goes into another room to get his projector and notes. while hes gone, jill quickly checks her makeup.  
<rachel> hey! have you guys seen jill? i cant find her anywhere. 
<monica> no, i havent. 
<rachel> well, is ross home? maybe ill just call him to see if hes actually seen her.  
< 
<s> who is it? 
<phoebe> its phoebe! phoebe!  
<s> hey! 
<phoebe>  oh god. so-so youre making porn movies. 
<s> no im not.  
<phoebe> youre making one right now! 
<phoebe> and-and youre using my name! 
<s> yeah, can i help you with something? 
<phoebe> look, im talking right now! youreyou mean her. 
<s> yknow, twin stuff is always a real big seller. 
<phoebe> what?! 
<s> yeah, i can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars. 
<phoebe> no!! no way! no! and stop using my name! and shame on you!  and shame on all of you! youre disgusting! especially you  with that!

<ross> slides are almost ready. 
<s> yeah. ooh, i know what this is missing! alcohol! 
<ross> uh okay, well theres-theres wine in the kitchen. 
<s> oh great!  
<ross>  hello? 
<rachel>  what is my sister doing there?! and why are the drapes shut?! 
<ross> o-okay, rach calm-calm down, okay? she-shes really upset were just talking. 
<rachel> ross! i think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me! 
<ross> so thats the only reason she could be here huh? it couldnt have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe im a good listener and i uh i put on a great slide show! 
<rachel> ross, i am telling you that she is using you to get back at me! 
<ross> yknow what? i think i can take care of myself, ill talk to you later. good-bye.  whoa! uh, that was your sister actually. she-she thinks that youre just using me. 
<s> so?  
< 
<phoebe> hey! 
<joey> hey! 
<phoebe> so, i just came from the company ursula works for. 
<joey> oh no, not you too! 
<phoebe> no! no! i just went to pick up phoebe buffays checks; there were a lot of them. 
<joey> nice! 
<phoebe> um-mmm, and i wont have to go there anymore because i gave them my correct address. 
<joey> thats great, but isnt it gonna bother that people still think youre a porn star? 
<phoebe> oh no! no! i know how to handle it. 
<joey> you do? 
<phoebe> yeah.  youre trying to figure out where you know me from? all right, ill give you a hint. from porn! okay?  yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie!  see? 
<joey> yeah. 
< 
<chandler> hey. 
<ross>  you uh, you may have been right about jill. 
<rachel> oh! i knew it! what happened? 
<ross> umm, she kissed me. 
<rachel> what?! you kissed! 
<chandler>  maybe we should give them some privacy. 
<monica>  shhhh!!! 
<ross> look, i uh, i tried not to kiss her, okay? 
<rachel> well, it doesnt sound like it! i mean, its pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just dont kiss them! see look at us, right now, not kissing! 
<ross> let me finish, okay? she started kissing me and-and i didnt stop it. i guess i-i just wasnt thinking 
<rachel> yeah thats right you werent thinking! yknow what? let me give you something to think about!  
<ross> oh waithold it! but then i started thinking and i stopped the kissing. 
<rachel> oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sisters mouth long enough to tell me that. 
<ross> look i-i realize if anything were to happen with me and jill then nothing could ever happen with us! 
<rachel> what?! 
<ross> no, i mean, look i dont know if anything is going to happen with us, again. ever. but i dont want to know that it-it never could. so i stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector. 
<rachel> wow. i, i dont even know what to say. thank you.  
<ross> youre welcome.   
<monica> oh my god! are-are you crying? 
<chandler>  i just dont see why those two cant work things out! ending credits 
< 
<s> all right, im leaving! because im not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. thats you rachel! 
<rachel> yeah, i got that. 
<s>  and you! i throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you? 
<ross> you take care jill. 
<s>  okay, see ya!  
<rachel> bye-bye-e! 
<monica> bye. 
<chandler>  i-i cant believe jills gone.  i cant help it, i opened a gate. first part of this episode is episode 615. the second part of this episode is episode 616. since episodes 615 and 616 are combined into one file, thats why there is no episode 616 in the season 6 table of contents and the numbers jump from episode 615 to 617.} 
< 
<rachel> hey, you guys! guess what? barry and mindy are getting a divorce! 
<monica> oh my god! 
<phoebe> wow! 
<joey>  what is the matter with you?! 
<phoebe> no! barry and mindy. 
<joey> oh sorry, i hear divorce i immediately go to ross.  who-whos barry and mindy? 
<rachel> barry was the guy that i was almost married and mindy was my best friend. 
<joey> ohh-oh, wasnt he cheating on you with her? 
<rachel> yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me. 
<monica> why did they get divorced? 
<rachel> well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. isnt that sad?  god, could you imagine if i actually married him?! i mean how different would my life be? 
<ross> i know what you mean, ive always wondered how different my life would be if-if id never gotten divorced. 
<phoebe> which time? 
<ross> the first time! no seriously, imagine if carol hadnt realized she was a lesbian. 
<joey>  i cant. i keep seeing it the good way. 
<ross> id bet id still be doing my kara-tay.  towards the end of our marriage i was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from yknow, not doing anything else physical. 
<chandler> maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay. 
<monica> and what if i was still fat?  well, you wouldnt be dating me, thats for sure. 
<chandler> sure i would! 
<s>  oh yeah! come on! yeah right! 
<chandler> what, you guys really think that im that shallow? 
<ross> no, i just think monica was that fat. 
<joey> hey, imagine if i never got fired off days of our lives!  oh-hey, theres carol again! 
<chandler> what if i had had the guts to quit my job? id probably be writing for the new yorker, getting paid to be funny. but my jobs fun too! i mean tomorrow, i-i dont have to wear a tie. 
<phoebe> what if i had taken that job at merrill lynch? 
<ross> what?! 
<rachel> merrill lynch? 
<phoebe> yeah, i had a massage client who worked there and-and he said i had a knack for stocks. 
<rachel> well why didnt you take the job? 
<phoebe> because at that time you see, i thought everything that rhymed was true. so i thought yknow that if id work with stocks, id have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox. 
<ross> hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, wed still hang out? opening credits the usual opening credits. oh no! these credits are based on the world that would have been created had all of the above actually happened. it starts out with all of them at the fountain sitting on the couch as fat monica runs up and sits on the arm of the couch, tilting the whole thing towards her. it then goes on to show rachels still a shop-aholic and with barry. fat monica is sweating while cooking and dancing while eating a donut. phoebe as the wall street shark smoking while on two cell phones. then theyre dancing in the fountain. joey entering as dr. drake remoray and meeting a groupie. chandler trying to write as a bird does its business on his shoulder and falling asleep while typing. ross doing some kara-tay and trying to get carol into bed. and finally, some more dancing in the fountain, them all flexing, and the turning out the lamp and shutting off all the lights bit from the first season. just remember one thing, this is an alternate universe. everything from every other episode doesnt apply, for instance, ross and rachel have no history. and in fact have not seen each other in years in this world.} 
< 
<ross>  oh my god! rachel green? 
<rachel>  rob tillman! 
<ross> no-no. its-its me, ross!

<rachel> ohh! okay! 
<ross> come on!  
<rachel> oh wait, dont you have to pay for your,  busty ladies?

<chandler> was his question whats more boring than him? 
<joey> hey man, look sorry about that archie thing. do uh, do you need me to give you some money? 
<chandler> hey, i may have no money, but i still have my pride. 
<joey> really? 
<chandler> ehh. 
<monica> maybe joey doesnt have to give you the money, tv stars have assistants right? 
<joey> thats an idea!  hey, if i hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her? 
<monica> no joey! chandler could be your assistant! see, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff! 
<joey> thats great! that would be great! lets do that! 
<chandler> i could use the money; it could give me time to write. 
<joey> oh right great! welcome aboard! 
<chandler> okay! 
<joey> all right! now hey, i need to use the bathroom. since i dont need any assistance in there, take a break!

<monica> chandler! 
<chandler> i know you probably dont want to go out with me, yknow because i make too many jokes and ive never been in a serious relationship and i guess im not technically a "doctor "

<chandler> no, there were two. 
<monica> including me? 
<chandler> oh yeah. ending credits

<chandler> yeah. 
<ross> yeah, what, what was i thinking? 
<joey>  hey! so, whats with the 20 percent tip? did i do something wrong? 
<chandler> twenty percent is a pretty generous tip joe. 
<joey> yknow whats more generous than that?! fifty percent! yknow whats even more generous than that?!! 
<chandler> i see where youre goin! 
<ross> whats up with the greed joe? 
<joey> all right, look im sorry you guys, but its just that i gotta get these new head shots made. and theyre really expensive, yknow? im down to like three! well, actually two cause one of em i kinda blackened in some teethwhy did i do that?!  
<ross> well isnt there something you can do to earn a little extra money? i mean, cant-cant you pick up, i dont know, an extra shift here? 
<phoebe> or, yknow, i used to beg for money. of course it helps if youve got yknow a little of this  goin on. wow! i still have it! 
<ross> oh, wait! wait! dont you have an audition today? yeah! maybe youll get that job! 
<joey> oh, ha-ha-ha! ooh! wait a minute, i used to get medical experiments down on me all the time! 
<chandler>  ah, finally an explanation. 
<joey> no-no! i used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? lets see uh, well i dont want to donate sperm again.  i really prefer doing that at the home office yknow?  ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh? 
<s>  joey! 
<joey> yeah? 
<s> what did i tell you about talking to your friends while youre working? 
<joey> uhh do it? 
<s> that guy  has been waiting for his coffee for ten minutes! hes complained about you three times!  
<joey> well, where was i?  opening credits 
< 
<ross> hi! 
<phoebe> hey! 
<ross> hey, what have you guys been up to? 
<phoebe> ohh! we went to a self-defense class today! 
<ross> wow! 
<rachel> yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya! 
<joey> takes it out of you?  
<phoebe> now, we can kick anybodys ass! 
<rachel> yeah! 
<ross> after one class? i dont think so. 
<rachel> what? you wanna see me self-defend myself?! go over there  and pretend youre a sexual predator! go on! i dare ya!! 
<ross> well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, thats not enough. look, i studying kara-tay for a long time, and theres a concept you should really be familiar with. its what the japanese call  unagi. 
<rachel> isnt that a kind of sushi? 
<ross> no, its a concept! 
<phoebe> yeah it is! it is! its freshwater eel! 
<ross> all right, maybe it means that too 
<rachel> ohh! i would kill for a salmon skin roll right now! 
<ross> yknow what? fine! get attacked! i dont even care! 
<phoebe>  come on ross. were sorry. please tell us what it is. 
<ross> unagi is a state of total awareness. okay? only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you! 
<phoebe> you mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?  
<ross>  all im saying is, its one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, i dont know, like a  surprise!!  
<ross> all right, you know that one was coming, but that doesnt mean you have unagi.  
<rachel>  ooh! yknow what? if we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour. 
<ross> yknow what  
<chandler> hey-hey, is monica here? 
<phoebe> no. 
<ross> no. 
<chandler> okay, look i need your help, i dont know what to get her for valentines day. 
<rachel> well, valentines day was like two weeks ago, so i wouldnt get her a calendar! 
<chandler>  she was working on valentines day so were celebrating it tonight. 
<joey> ohh, hey! why dont you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas? 
<phoebe> ooh, joey, thats actually a really good idea! 
<joey> and of course, crotchless panties. 
<chandler> well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend  and her brother,  i cant do that we promised wed make each other gifts this year. 
<rachel> aw, i love that. 
<phoebe> you guys! 
<joey> you cant make crotchless panties? you take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut 
<rachel>  okay-okay-okay! so, making things. that sounds like so much fun.

<phoebe> ohh, youre a freak!! 
<ross> perhaps. now im curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass? 
<rachel> all right, so we werent prepared! 
<ross> im sorry i had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but ilook, i just want you guys to be safe.  danger!!!!!  ahhh, huh? unagi.

<ross> yknow what? shed-shed love this.  uh, its an exact replica of apollo 8. i made it in the sixth grade. 
<chandler> yeah, i guess i could use that. i could say that your love sends me to the moon. 
<ross> yeah-yeah, except apollo 8 didnt actually land on the moon. but you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.  
<chandler> wait a minute, i cant give this to her. 
<ross> why not? 
<chandler> because it says "captain ross" on the side and "i hate monica" on the bottom.

<rachel> okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl? 
<ross> its a girl! anyway, it wouit wouldnt matter. okay? because im a teacher and shes a student. 
<chandler> oh, is that against the rules? 
<ross> no, but it is frowned upon. 
<chandler> i see. 
<ross> besides, theres a big age difference. 
<joey> oh, well think of it like this, when youre 90 
<ross> i know when im 90 shell be like 80 and it wont seem like such a big difference. 
<joey> no thats not what i was going to say at all. no, what i was going to say is when youre 90 youll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old. opening credits

<rachel> oh my god! it sure didnt look this way when i lived here. 
<monica> i know! now look, theres only one problem though. theres only room for one, so i guess one of you will have to stay at joeys. 
<phoebe> well, since the fire was kinda my fault i guess  you should get to stay here. 
<rachel> hey! hey-hey, now this was no ones fault pheebs. okay? it was an accident. 
<phoebe> well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room. 
<rachel> okay!  
<monica> so rach! youre the first guest at hotel monica! umm, youll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. and i thought i would bring them to you, yknow, in bed. oh, you have been through so much. 
<rachel> i have. 
< 
<joey> this right here is where i keep the pizza.  and uh thats where the napkin is.  
<phoebe> whats that smell? 
<joey> i know!  
< 
<s> oh please! it was such a big class! you never even noticed me! 
<ross> what? of course i did! you uh, you sat next to sleepy sleeperson. 
<s> who? 
<ross> oh uh, i had trouble remembering everyones name, so i-i kinda came up with nicknames. like the guy on the other side of you was smelly von brownshirt. 
<s> oh yeah. so umm, did you have a nickname for me? 
<ross> umm, no. no. 
<s> yes you did! what was it? 
<ross> umm, its cutie mcpretty. 
<s> ohh thats so sweet! 
<ross> listen, i gotta tell ya, i-im having a great time! yknow how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank i thought it would be too, but its not. i mean its not at all. 
<s>  dr. geller! 
<ross>  burt! 
< 
<phoebe> so did you sleep well last night? 
<rachel> i did. 
<phoebe> yeah? 
<rachel> i did, monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow. 
<phoebe> yknow what joey left on my pillow? 
<rachel> what? 
<phoebe> gum! 
<phoebe> yeah i know, it was my candle. my candle! like a curling iron. 
<phoebe> i dont use a curling iron.  
<rachel> well, dont look at me! my hairs straight! straight! straight! straight! 
<rachel> oh. 
< 
<joey> this is where i keep the pizza.  andhey! where did the napkin go?!  commercial break 
< 
<monica> now there you go! i wouldnt want my best guest to strain her eyes! 
<phoebe> thanks monica! 
<monica> does that smell bother you? 
<phoebe> what the smell from joeys? no, i can hardly smell it over here. 
<monica> well you let me know if you can, because yknow i can bake a pie to cover it. 
<phoebe> i can smell it a little, bake the pie. 
<monica> okay! 
<phoebe> okay.  
<monica> hello?  oh yes, one minute please.  its for you. its the fire inspector. 
<phoebe> oh!  hello?  yeah this is phoebe.  really?!  
<joey>  yeah, so it turns out that it wasnt the hair straightener that started the fire.  no-no, it was the candles. its very not good leaving candles unattended. in fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is  uhh uhh okay. well, i have to go now.  
< 
<ross> we had such a great time! shes-shes incredible! i thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasnt. it wasnt at all. elizabeth is very mature for her age.   a concept lost on some people! 
<monica> so its okay to date a student. 
<ross> well, not really. i mean technically its-its not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. especially by that professor we ran into last night, judgey von holierthanthou. 
<monica> well ross, you be careful now. you dont want to get a reputation as yknow professor mcnailshisstudents. 
<ross> yeah. what-what should i do? 
<joey> well ross, it seems pretty clear. i mean whats more important? what people think or how you feel, huh? ross, you gotta follow your heart. 
<monica> joey that is so sweet.  
<chandler>  hey. 
<joey> hey-hey-hey! so, how did it go with dana? any reason i should leave a block of time open say thursday?

<monica> what?! youre going out with her again! 
<ross> going out with who? 
<chandler> uh, dana keystone from college. 
<ross> oh yeah! wasnt she uh  
<chandler> no, that was dana caplin. 
<s> ohhhh!  
<monica> joey! you didnt even know her! 
<joey> ah whatever! 
< 
<chandler> great story again! the yarns that you weave! woo-hoo-hoo!

<chandler> no-noreally?! 
<s> of course! 
<chandler>  well, it just hurts so bad. i uh 
<s> ohh, im sorry. 
<chandler> well maybe there is one thing you can do. 
<s> what?! anything! anything! 
<chandler> well, i umm, i mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but i have this friend. this actor friend and he would kill me if he thought i was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on thursday? 
<s> absolutely! but you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie? 
<chandler> well, the heart wants what it wants. ill see you later.  
< 
<monica> hey! hows it goin? 
<phoebe> well, not much has changed in the last five minutes. 
<monica> yes it has! i made cookies!

<chandler> damn those robots, theyre supposed to be our faithful servants! 
<joey> anyway, it wasnt the robot, it was the guy who controls him. yeah, he doesnt like me. he had c.h.e.e.s.e. knock over the sandwich right when i was reaching for one! ohh! 
<phoebe> well, why dont you just get him fired? 
<joey> i may have to, i hate to do it, but im the star! yknow? theres a limit to how many sandwiches i can eat off the floor.  excuse me.  joey tribbiani. 
<s>  joe! im glad i found ya, i got an audition for ya! 
<joey> wow!

<ross> you were at the coffeehouse! 
<rachel> ross, whats the big deal? so i kissed the guy! 
<ross> he is my girlfriends father, okay? its-its, its weird!

<ross> that was different! 
<rachel> what? why?! 
<ross> this is weird for me! 
<rachel> ross look, look this is good for you. okay? lets face it, so far the guys not lovin ya! but i can turn that around! i got the inside track! we can all go out to dinner, yknow? and i can talk you up! ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer! 
<ross> how is that important? 
<rachel> oh its important!

<joey> apparently, theres like a million guys out there that can play mac, and theres only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! i didnt know he could get me fired! what am i going to do? 
<monica> well yknow joey, youre a pretty charming guy. 
<joey> thanks, but i kinda have a problem to deal with here. 
<monica> no sweetie, youve got to win over the guy that controls c.h.e.e.s.e.! youve got to kiss some serious robot ass! 
<joey> thats not a bad idea. yeah. okay, but if i got to turn on the charm tomorrow im not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.  well, actually i got a little bit saved for you pheebs.  
<chandler> so do you think uh, joeys more charming than me? 
<monica> yeah! thats why im sleeping with him on the side. 
<chandler> yeah, you wish.  
<phoebe>  "you wish." 
<monica> phoebe, stop writing about us!

< 
<rachel> so it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so ross selflessly, offered to take me. 
<s> what a nice story! 
<s> so ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom. 
<rachel> wow! i definitely did not see that one backfiring! im gonna go to the bathroom. 
<ross> yeah, take your time.  
<ross>  just-just so you know i was a freshman and she was a senior. so it wasnt as bad as-as 
<s> ross, look, i know ive been giving you a lot of jabs and its partly because im very protective of lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. but i have to admit that after all the wonderful things that lizzie has told me and the many, many,  many stories that rachel has told me that, well  youre not  all bad. 
<ross> not all bad. 
<s> and anyhow, im sorry i was so harsh before, but you have to understand that i  still look at lizzie like shes a twelve-year-old girl. 
<ross> yeah. you know what? i know what you mean; i do that too. 
<s> i beg your pardon? 
<ross> no! no! noti dont mean i-i see her as a twelve-year-old girl! i mean i-i have a son, whos umm six and i still think of him as a baby. 
<s> you have a son? 
<ross> yeah, well my-my ex-wife and i share custody of ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, carol and i are on excellent terms as im sure you are with your wife!  oh, im sorry!  its unbelievable! 
<s> dont worry about it, i just didnt realize you were married.  
<rachel> oh we were, but that was just a , i mean that was just a big drunken mistake. 
<ross> youre back. 
<s> you two were married?! 
<rachel> oh! whoops! im sorry, you were talking about emily!  
< 
<monica> chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six. 
<chandler> we said seven! 
<monica> we said six! 
<chandler> the only way that i said six would be if the sevens, let meet at seven, not at six. 
<monica> yeah and if i had seven, maybe i wouldve said something like this, "wow! my boyfriends such a wise assseven!" 
<phoebe>  hi! 
<chandler> oh my good god. 
<monica> ugh! 
<phoebe> i know what time you said. 
<chandler> what?! 
<phoebe> well actually, i know what time chester and marcia said. 
<monica> what time? 
<phoebe> quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly its my book to the rescue, huh?  ooh, very interesting. yeah, well this certainly clears things up. 
<chandler>  what does it say?! 
<phoebe> i will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book. 
<chandler> thank you for writing your book. its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything. 
<phoebe> thanks! so are you. 
<chandler>  i told you i should not wear this color.  
<phoebe>  mon  marcia and chester are planning on seeing a movie on sunday night. marcia thinks theyre supposed to meet at six, chester thinks its at seven. 
<chandler> so you knew we were gonna miss the movie! 
<phoebe> thats right. 
<monica> inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book! 
<phoebe>  marcia and chester are mad at phyllis. 
< 
<joey> i cant believe im going to lose this job!

<joey> what are you in love with her or something? 
<s> yeah. her. all of them. anyone. 
<chandler> yeah, ive been there my friend. 
<s> listen, i-i guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do. 
<joey> oh wow wayne, its not really something you can teach yknow? its pretty much something youre born with if youyou-you can teach it! ill show you right how to do it. 
< 
<rachel> i mean if you think about it, i mean ross did learn something from each marriage. 
<s> how to make the next one even shorter? 
<rachel> now wait a minute thats not fair. he was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to emily, he just didnt tell me.  maybe i have to pee again.  
<s> well, this is fun. so ross, did you kill any of these wives? 
<ross> yknow what? i-i-i i-i have had enough of this! yknow, i-i-i care a great deal about your daughter and i have treated her with nothing but respect! so if-if youve got a problem with me, frankly 
<s> are you yelling at me?! 
<ross> god no! 
<s> yknow what daddy? if you dont like ross, thats fine. it doesnt matter to me, im gonna go out with him anyway. 
<s> really?!  
<ross> well if it doesnt matter to her, it doesnt matter to me!  still not yelling! 
<s> wow. what can i say?  this doesnt make me like you any better! 
<ross> thats okay, im not so crazy about myself right now either. 
<s> then we agree? 
<ross> uh yeah, i guessyeah! i guess so. 
<s> neither of us like ross! 
<s> i like ross. 
<ross> ohhh! kids! 
<rachel>  wait-wait-wait, i just thought of another story about how nice ross is! 
<ross> thats okay rach, were not liking ross right now. 
<rachel> oh! ive got a lot of those too! ending credits 
< 
<joey> well, it turns out you were right c.h.e.e.s.e.

<phoebe>  hi, you guys. 
<chandler> hey! 
<monica> hi! 
<rachel> whats the matter? 
<phoebe> well its justits one of those situations that i just hate. yknow? a massage client gave me three tickets to the helmet-pelts exhibit at the morgan chase museum. 
<joey>  now youre thinking you gotta sleep with him. 
<phoebe> no! no! its just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us! 
<chandler> ill give up my ticket. 
<joey> me too. 
<phoebe> okay thats so generous! 
<chandler> and i think ross is generous too. 
<phoebe> great! okay then its just us girls! 
<phoebe> yeah. 
<rachel> so what-what is the exhibit. 
<phoebe> its mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches. 
<joey> oh man!  
<ross>  hey! 
<rachel> hi! 
<chandler> hey! 
<joey> hey ross listen chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend! 
<ross> thanks? but i have plans; elizabeth and i are going out of town. 
<monica> oh thats great! 
<ross> yeah. 
<monica> i mean think about all the money that youre gonna make! 
<ross> why? what? 
<monica> well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right? 
<ross> no, no, thats funny. but maybe its time to move on, let it go, yknow? stop it! besides, rachel is going out with elizabeths father, so ah, hes much older than she is. looks like im not the only one interested in fossils, huh? 
<rachel> i mean ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils. 
<ross> okay, okay. uh, well uh, rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings  in his ear.  
<chandler> ross. 
<ross> oh, come on you guys; thats funny! yknow? because hes needhes got like a hearing aide yknow, cause-cause yknow, cause hes all old, and  
<s> okay look, ross, just so you know that since lizzie likes you so much, ive decided to accept the fact that youre going out with her. 
<ross> really? that okay, thats great. 
<s> yeah. but then i changed my mind. im funny like that. so i told lizzie, now im telling you, i dont want you seeing my daughter anymore. 
<ross> all right look, i-i realize it upsets you. 
<s> yes it does. 
<ross> but, elizabeth and i are-are both adults and so i dont think theres really anything you can do about it. 
<s> ill call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired. 
<ross> ohh! a man with a plan! opening credits 
<

<rachel> what?! no! why?! 
<phoebe> no reason! that would just be a really big surprise, right?  and put the wedding ceremony right over here.  
<rachel> i didnt know you could get married here. 
<monica> this would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but i wouldnt put the aisle there and i would never have the ceremony there!  i mean youd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch.  
<rachel> oh sorry didnt mean to interrupt. its just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here? waiting list. sorry!  
<rachel> monica, you should totally put your name down on the list 
<monica> what?! are you crazy?! im not getting married! im not even engaged. 
<phoebe> yeah, but theres a two-year wait. and then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. thats four years. chandlers not gonna wait that long. hes gonna find somebody else, yknow? someone, someone who did put their name on the list.  
<rachel> yeah hon, it cant hurt to put your name down! i mean in if two years if youre not engaged you just dont use it. 
<monica> well, i mean i guess there is no harm in putting my name down. 
<rachel> im gonna do it too! 
<phoebe> me too! 
<rachel> really? who would, who would you marry? 
<phoebe> i dont know, i dont have anyone right now. yknow?

<monica> it was a mistake. please dont take this to mean anything, because it doesnt. 
<chandler> okay.

<phoebe> do you think thats something that hed be mad at you for? 
<ross> i guess it could. 
<phoebe> well then i think thats it. 
<ross> well, if hes angry, he really shouldnt just cover it up. i-i wish he would just tell me the truth. 
<phoebe> oh, if thats what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.

<chandler> no, its not! when i looked at the other ring i could see monicas face when i gave it to her, yknow? and i could see her saying yes. when i look at this ring, all i see is a ring! unless i look at it really closely and then i can see my own eye.  look, this is the most important thing im gonna do in my life. i wanna make sure its perfect. 
<phoebe> okay. there may be a way that we can get the other ring back. cause i heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. so maybe we can get him to trade rings or something. 
<chandler> i cant do that. 
<phoebe> well you certainly cant give her that stupid gumball ring. 
< 
<phoebe> there he is!

<s> youre dying?!  
<chandler> yeah, shes dying of a cough apparently. 
<phoebe> yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. see, if im not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity

<rachel> why would a charity give away a free boat?! 
<joey> i dont know! charity? 
<rachel> ugh! 
<phoebe> well, just buy the damn boat!  
<rachel> phoebe, dont you think youve had enough to drink? 
<phoebe> im just helping the kids! 
<rachel> how is you drinking helping the kids? 
<phoebe> because the more i drink, the less there is for the kids to drink. 
<joey> oh hi! the youth center. 
<joey> just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth? 
<joey>  hey, i was pretty close.  uhh, so bad news. umm, i cant buy the boat, i dont have any money.  
<rachel> joey! joey, good one!   
<joey> so uh listen, i think im gonna take off now.  
<rachel>  hey! you cant leave joey! you agreed to buy that boat, all right?! that is a contract! and plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me! 
<joey> well, what am i gonna do rach?! i dont have that kind of money! 
<rachel> i know. okay.  okay. okay. all right. all right, this is what were gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then youre just gonna pay the difference. 
<joey> okay. 
<rachel> okay. 
<joey> look, i dont know why the kids need a youth center anyway! yknow? they should just watch tv after school like i did and i turned out fine! 
<rachel> not great. 
< 
<monica> and so, were hiding in the bathroom. 
<s> and-and then i sneak out and before monica can her parents come in. 
<monica> so i hide in the shower and the next thing you know theyre going at it right on the bathroom floor. 
<s>  oh my god! 
<chandler> i got a good one, i got a good one! i once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.  
<s> its so great seeing you guys again. id like to make a toast.  uh, as a poet once said, "in the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed." 
<monica> ohh. 
<chandler> what?!  
< 
<ross> oh my god, you guys!!  
<chandler>  before you say anything, have we got a story for you! guess who we bumped into at dinner! 
<ross> who? 
<chandler> richard! 
<ross> what?  a-ohh!  ohh. oh thats right thats right. thats richards favorite place too. 
<chandler> oh you knew that. good! 
<monica> i thought you were going out with elizabeth. 
<ross> yeah, i was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight. 
<monica> oh ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just cant get out of! 
<ross> yknow, maybe she is too young for me. yknow, when i was over there and she was running around with her friends, i felt like i was a baby-sitter. i finally started to see what you guys were talking about. i dont know what to do. 
<monica> why dont you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. i mean thats what i did when i first  weighing stuff. 
<ross> okay umm, bad stuff. well, im-im 12 years older than she is. 
<monica> if the school finds out youre fired. 
<ross> hmm. 
<monica> shes leaving for three months. 
<chandler> for camp! 
<ross> okay, good stuff. umm, well shes-shes sweet and pretty and 
<monica> look ross, the only question you need to ask is, "do you see a future?" i mean like do you see yourself marrying her?  oh my god! you did it already! you married her, didnt you?! 
<ross> no! no! i didnt do that. its just okay, honestly no. i dont, i dont see a big future with her. 
<monica> okay well i think thats your answer. 
<ross> ive got to talk to her. ugh, i hate this part. 
<chandler> hey, you have to forget about elizabeth. i mean if youre not careful you may not get married at all this year! 
< 
<joey> rach! rachel! okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.

<phoebe> oh, en chante.

<joey> oooooh 
<rachel> okay look, let me paint you a little picture.  all right, you are settin sail up the hudson! youve got the wind in your harms! you-you get all that peace and quiet that youve always wanted! you get back to nature! you can go fishin! you canooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when youre old, cappy. 
<joey> no way! its mine!! 
<rachel>  what?! what?! 
<joey> all that stuff you just said? i want that! 
<rachel> but joey you dont have $20,000! 
<joey> who cares?! i-ill make payments, whatever it takes, i want the mr. bowmont!! 
< 
<joey> oh my god, youre back! 
<phoebe> ohh, let me see it! let me see your hand!  
<monica> why do you want to see my hand? 
<phoebe> i wanna see whats in your hand. i wanna see the trash. 
<joey> yeah.  
<phoebe> eww! oh, its all dirty. you should throw this out. 
<monica>  okay.  
<chandler>  what did you guys just do?! 
<phoebe> what happened? 
<chandler> richard was there so i couldnt do it! 
<joey> what?! noooo  
<chandler> im gonna do it tomorrow yknow, and-and surprise her, but now youve ruined it! 
<joey> we didnt ruin it! 
<chandler> who walks into a room and asks to see a persons hands?! 
<phoebe> well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor 
<joey> glove salesman! 
<phoebe> good one! yeah. 
<chandler> this is terrible. what am i going to do? 
<phoebe> look, she only suspects something okay? she doesnt know for sure, so just throw her off the track. 
<chandler> thats right, i can throw her off. i can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind. 
<phoebe> yeah! yeah! convince her that-that youre scared of commitment! convince her that youre a little coward! 
<chandler> i can do that, ive had 30 years of practice. 
<joey> hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!  
<monica>  i had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes! 
<joey> that guys still doing that?! 
<rachel>  hey!  oh my god youre here, let me see your hand!! 
<phoebe> no, youre too late!!! she already took out the trash!!! 
< 
<ross>  wow! i have never had such a healthy break-up! she was such a grown-up about it! she didnt seem too immature for me! did i just make a huge mistake? 
<s>  ross! wait! 
<ross> elizabeth, thank god! i was just thinking about 
<s> you suck!! 
<ross> what?!  
<ross> okay, break-ups still on! 
< 
<chandler> okay, okay, here she comes!  how do i look? do i look like a guy who doesnt want to get married? 
<joey> yeah! and also, a little like a french guy.  i never noticed that before. 
<monica>  hi guys! 
<joey> hey! 
<chandler> hey! 
<monica> what are you up too? 
<chandler> oh, just hanging out, talkin about uh, websites.  yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you. 
<joey>  yeah, big brother. 
<monica> well thats a little crazy. although i am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the internet. 
<chandler> yeah, well yknow, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh? 
<monica> why?! to celebrate your relationship! to solidify your commitment! to declare your love for one another to the world! 
<chandler> eh 
<monica> okay well thats good to know.  
<joey>  the mr. bowmonts here!!!  
< 
<s> hey monica, theres a customer who wants to complement the chef, should i let him in?

<s>  come on in.  
<s> hi! 
<monica> richard! 
<s> actually, im not here to complement the chef. 
<monica> ohh oh, thats okay i hate when people come back to complement the chef. like i have nothing better to do! so whats up? 
<s> well, it was great seeing you the other night. 
<monica> oh, good to see you too. did you come down here to tell me that? 
<s> no! i came here to tell you something else.  i came here  to tell you i still love you. commercial break 
< 
<monica> what uhwhat did youwhat?! 
<s> i still love you. and i know i probably shouldnt even be here telling you this, i mean youre with chandler a guy i really like, and if you say hes straight ill believe you! after seeing ya the other night i knew if i didnt tell ya id regret it for the rest of my life. letting you go was the stupidest thing i ever did. 
<monica> yknow youre really not supposed to be back here! 
<s> well yeah, im sorry. i know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but i had to tell ya! i wanna spend my life with you. i wanna marry you. i wanna have kids with you. 
<monica> oh god  why dont they put chairs back here?! 
<s> i know this is crazy but am i too late? 
<monica> what the yes youre too late! where was all this three years ago?! 
<s> well i know i was an idiot! and i tried to forget you, i really did! yknow after we had lunch last year i spent six months in africa trying to get you out of my head! 
<monica> what were you doing in africa? 
<s> working with blind kids. 
<monica> ohhh! what are you doing to me?! oh look, i-i im sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen. 
<s> okay thats fine, ill walk away. and ill never bother you again, but only if you tell me chandlers willing to give you everything i am. 
<monica> well he is! yeah, i mean marriage is all he talks about! my goodness, in fact, im the one thats making him wait! 
<s> you are? 
<monica> yeah! 
<s> why? 
<monica> why? because of the government. 
< 
<rachel> isnt it incredible?! monica and chandler, gettin married. 
<phoebe> i know, theyre gonna be so happy together. 
<rachel> ohh i mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen? 
<phoebe> not that often! 
<rachel> no! im so happy for them! 
<phoebe> me too! so happy for them! 
<rachel> im so happy and not at all jealous. 
<phoebe> oh no! no god, definitely not jealous!  
<rachel> i mean im probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. and i mean whats 2%? thats nothing. 
<phoebe> totally. im like 90/10. 
<rachel> yeah me too.  
<joey> hey uh, have you guys scene chandler? 
<rachel>  whno, but yknow who did stop in here looking for ya, tennille. 
< 
<monica> so that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you dont really believe that do you? 
<chandler> sure i do. in fact, i think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. i mean look at pigs. lets take a second here and look at pigs. okay pigs dont mate for life. i mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and thats just an ordinary pig not even a pig thats good at sports! 
<monica> yeah, but thats pigs not people! 
<chandler> if marriage worked, id be all for it. but do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%. 
<monica> wait a minute. are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married? 
<chandler> well, never say never but yknow probably uh yeah, never. 
<monica> oh my god! then-then-then what are we even doing?! what is this?! 
<chandler> whoa! whoa! whoa! what is all this pressure?! is this some new kind of strategy? why dont you put down your copy of the rules huh mantrap?! 
<monica> yknow what?! i gotta go! ugh!  
<chandler>  its okay, i got a plan. 
< 
<rachel> were gonna find love! 
<phoebe> definitely! 
<rachel> yeah, im pretty confident about that. thats what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for monica and chandler! it would be nice to have a little guarantee though. 
<phoebe> what do you mean? 
<rachel> well yknow, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40, they marry each other. 
<phoebe> you mean a backup? 
<rachel> exactly! 
<phoebe> yeah, yeah i got that. 
<rachel> you do? 
<phoebe> hm-mmm. 
<rachel> who? 
<phoebe> joey. 
<rachel> joey?! 
<phoebe> yeah! 
<rachel> are you serious?! 
<phoebe> yeah, i locked him years ago! 
<rachel> wh so if neither of you are married by the time youre 40, youre gonna marry joey. 
<phoebe> yep, we shook on it. yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal. 
<rachel> oh, seriously? 
<phoebe> ohh, yeah. i think his exact words were  
<rachel> charming. 
<phoebe> well hey, its just a backup. 
<rachel> yeah. 
< 
<joey> hey monica! 
<monica> have you seen rachel? or a mirror? 
<joey> this is for my boat, pretty cool huh? 
<monica> yeah, its great. 
<joey> whoa-whoa, whats the matter?! talk to the captain! 
<monica> im just having one of those days where you realize youre in a dead-end relationship! 
<joey> chandler giving you a hard time huh? 
<monica> its not like i want to get married tomorrow! its just that i-id like to believe that im in a relationship thats actually going somewhere, that im not just wasting my time! 
<joey> well, you know chandler. 
<monica> no i dont know chandler! not anymore! its like its like somethings changed. 
<joey> maybe you changed? 
<monica> i didnt change! 
<joey> maybe thats the problem. 
<monica> what?! 
<joey> chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife. 
<monica> is that some kind of boat talk? 
<joey> i dont know!  i havent totally decided how to talk on my boat yet. 
<monica> what does he think? does he think im just gonna wait around for nothing? 
<joey> monica face it, chandler is against marriage. and-and always will be! 
<monica>  well theres some people who do want to marry me. 
<joey> there are? 
<monica> yeah! richard! 
<joey> r-r-richard said he wants to marry you?!  and-and chandlers tellin ya how much he hates marriage?! 
<monica> thats right. 
<joey> chandler loves marriage!! 
<monica> you just told me that he hates marriage! that-that hes a-a complex fellow whos unlikely to take a wife! that-that hes against marriage and always will be! 
<joey> you got that from what i said?! 
< 
<s> when the cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone. 
<ross> what happened you guys?  
<ross> rach! 
<rachel> hey you! 
<ross> hey, come on in. 
<rachel> oh thank you. hey yknow, im so sorry to hear about you and elizabeth. 
<ross> oh, thanks. yeah, i really thought wed be able to make it work, but uh, i guess it just wasnt meant to be. 
<rachel> yeah, love. its a tricky business isnt it? 
<ross> i guess so. 
<rachel> so what do you say we make a pact? if you and i are both single by the time were 40, we get married. i mean, we know each other, we like each other, and weve-weve already slept together so yknow therell be no surprises there! you know what i mean? no like, "whats that?!" 
<ross> right. ohh! you-you want me to be your backup. 
<rachel> exactly. 
<ross> ohh, yeah i already have one. 
<rachel> what? who? 
<ross> phoebe. 
<rachel> phoebe?! wait abut-but she just, she said that joey was her backup. 
<ross> ohh, i dont think so. 
<rachel> ross! i just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and joey made a deal! 
<ross> thats impossible! i mean we have had a deal for years! we-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that. 
< 
<joey> where the hell have you been?! 
<chandler> i was making a coconut phone with the professor. 
<joey> richard told monica he wants to marry her! 
<chandler> what?! 
<joey> yeah! yeah, ive been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe i would have if these  damn boat shoes wouldnt keep flying off! 
<chandler> myoh my god! 
<joey> i know! they suck!! 
<chandler> hes not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! im supposed to do that! 
<joey> i know! 
<chandler> well what yknow what im gonna do? im gonna go over there; im gonna kick his ass!  will you help me?! 
<joey> look, chandler i dont think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. okay? just go and find monica! 
<chandler> youre right. 
<joey> yeah! 
<chandler> okay.  im gonna get the ring! im gonna get the ring!  im gonna go find her and  im just going to propose! 
<joey> okay. 
<chandler> okay great.

<s> so monica let me ask you a question. yknow, since we broke up do you ever, think about me? 
<monica> uh yeah, i-i actually i thought about you a couple months ago. 
<s> oh really? 
<monica> yeah but it was because i-i had an eye exam and i dont like my new eye doctor. 
<s> who is it? 
<monica> edward nevski? 
<s> yeah hes no good. do you ever  think about me in a  non-eye doctor way?

<s> i think thats fair. 
<monica> fair? please dont even talk to me about fair! fair wouldve been you wanting to marry me back then! or fair wouldve been chandler wanting to marry me now! believe me, nothing about this is fair! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing!

<chandler> and what does she have to think about? i love her! 
<s> well, apparently im willing to offer her things that you are not. 
<chandler> but i am willing to offer her all those things. this was just a plan, yknow? a way to throw her off course so that when i offered her all these things, shed be surprised! 
<s> well if it helps, it worked very well. 
<chandler> it was working until you showed up, you big tree! i mean, this isnt fair. you had your chance with her! you had your chance and you blew it! and this is my chance and i am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! and this is all just been one stupid mistake!  i was gonna propose tonight.

<joey> i-i did! i told her everything, chandler! but she wouldnt believe me.

<joey> i am so sorry man.  
<monica> you wanted it to be a surprise.

<chandler> okay!  okay! okay! oh god, i thought  wait a minute, i-i can do this.  i thought that it mattered what i said or where i said it. then i realized the only thing that matters is that you,  you make me happier than i ever thought i could be.  and if youll let me, i will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.  monica, will you marry me?

<joey> yeah! 
<chandler> uh, youve had a lot of sex right? 
<joey> when? today? some, not a lot. 
<chandler> well, its just the reason that im asking is because i kind of eh, uh, i was unable toi mean i really wanted to, but i couldnt . there huhhmm, there-there was an incident. 
<joey> dont worry about that man, that happens. 
<chandler> its happened to you?

< 
<ross> okay, monica. mon, uh what-what you just saw 
<monica>  can i ask you just a little question, huh? why tonight? 
<rachel> what? 
<monica> see, ive been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people im only planning on doing this once. so, uh yknow, maybe this is selfish and im sorry about it, but i was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that. 
<rachel> oh honey, but it is just about 
<ross> it is! it is! 
<monica> no its not! no! no! now its about you and ross getting back together! 
<rachel> what?! 
<monica> see yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder! 
<ross> okay! ho-ho! we did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together! 
<rachel> yeah. no. and you know what? nobody even saw! 
<ross> yeah! 
<monica> thats true. 
<rachel> honey i swear it we just kissed. 
<ross> it was just a kiss.  
<phoebe> you guys kissed!!!!! what does this mean?!! are you, are you getting back together?! can i sing at your wedding? 
<monica> thunder being stolen!! 
<rachel> okay come on phoebe, its nothing! monica, come on! 
<ross> look lets not make a big deal out of this! it was a one time thing. it doesnt even matter!  
<joey> oh my god! i cannot believe you guys are talking about this! the problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! all right?!! now chandler is doing the best he can!! 
<chandler>  i dont think thats what they were talking about joe!! 
<phoebe> what a great night, chandler cant do it, these guys kissed  
<joey> what? 
<chandler> what?! 
<joey> you guys kissed! oh mythis is huge! 
<rachel> no! 
<ross> oh no! 
<rachel> no-no, its really not huge. 
<ross> and; people thinking its huge has led monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  which we are not! 
<monica> well, were still talking about it, arent we? 
<phoebe> well yeah, that and chandlers problem. 
<joey> monica-monica-monica-monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about ross and rachel. 
<monica> yes that would be lovely. 
<joey> you got it. okay. now, i can pass for 19 right?! 
<chandler> yes, you can pass for 19. 
<joey> really? 
<chandler> yes! 
<joey> seriously? 
<chandler> seriously? seriously, no! you can play your own age which is 31! 
<joey>  im 30! 
<rachel> joey, you are not! youre 31. 
<joey>  aww crap! 
<phoebe> okay, so the plaza! okay, well get us some mai thais,  maybe no more for you though. 
<monica> yknow what? i-i think that umm, i dont feel like going to the plaza. 
<phoebe> why?! 
<rachel> honey, monica, this is ridiculous! look 
<monica> no-no, i-i really dont want to talk about it! i dont!  especially with you.  
<joey> psss, that is whack! 
<phoebe>  yeah?  okay, i think ill play it at the wedding. 
<joey> yeah! well, i think well see if they actually let you play. huh? i mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "you look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "no you dont." 
<phoebe> well, i dont think monica is gonna take this away. 
<joey> wouldnt she? 
<phoebe> would she? 
<joey> would she?  you ate my candy bar! 
< 
<ross> guess who?  
<rachel> hey. 
<ross> hey, i just realized we kinda left some stuff up in the air 
<rachel> what do you think monica meant when she said she didnt want to talk, especially with me? i mean, why not especially you and me? we were both out there kissing. 
<ross> still thinking about it huh? 
<rachel> come on! serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that?  especially you! 
<ross>  oh, who cares? 
<rachel> i care! 
<ross>  and so do i. 
<rachel> yknow what, i-i have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed? 
<ross> okay. sure.  
<rachel> am i going to let you watch me undress? 
<ross>  no!  
< 
<monica> i cant believe her, yknow its justits so typical. 
<chandler> now monica, i know youre upset, but dont forget. there is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then theres going to be a honeymoon, maybe in paris. 
<monica> paris? 
<chandler> we will take a moonlit walk on the rue de la . 
<monica> keep talking. 
<chandler> then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. not just because its romantic, but because i can! 
<monica> i love you!  
<monica>  bonjour, monsieur. 
<chandler> okay, dont say anything, you might scare it away.  
<chandler> its paris, who knows were here! 
<monica>  hi pheebs, whats up?  
<phoebe> okay, you said i could sing at your wedding so, im just gonna need a small deposit. 
<monica> what?! 
<phoebe> yknow, just some good faith money to hold the date. 
<chandler> pheebs, were not giving you a deposit for our wedding! 
<phoebe> oh, i see.  [cut to the living room, joey is eating a sandwich.) 
<joey> they break your heart, dont they? 
<phoebe> yknow, i dont really need their permission. 
<joey> yeah! if you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding! 
<phoebe> yeah! and if you wanna look 19, then you you gotta do something about your eyes. 
<joey> what?! whats wrong with my eyes. 
<phoebe> they give you away! theres just-theres just too much wisdom in there.  just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes. 
<joey> and thatll get rid of my wisdom? 
<phoebe> maybe just 10 minutes for you.  
<chandler> oh, give her the deposit! give her the ring! i dont care!  
<monica> yes. 
<rachel> monica, what did you mean before when you said you didnt want to talk to anyone, especially me? 
<chandler> what a great apology!  and you accept! okay, bye-bye! 
<rachel> no-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about? 
<monica> well, lets just say its not the first time youve stolen my thunder. 
<rachel> what?! 
<ross>  hey, heres a thought.  
<rachel> monica, what are you talking about? 
<monica> my sweet sixteen! remember, you went to third base with my cousin charlie. 
<chandler>  ahh, third base. 
<monica> its all everybody at the party could talk about! 
<rachel> monica, yknow what? the only reason i did that was because your party was so boring! 
<monica>  we had a caricaturist! 
<rachel> oh!! 
<phoebe>  "whenever i get married, guess who wont get to sing? somebody named geller! and somebody else named bing!"  
<rachel> monica, your sweet sixteen was like a million years ago. 
<monica> and yet, here we are doing it again. 
<rachel> ugh, monica i dont want to steal your stupid thunder! 
<monica> oh please! why else would you have made out with ross?! 
<ross> got me.  
<rachel> all right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it aint gonna happen! 
<monica> i just thought it would be nice if i could have just this one night! 
<rachel> i swear, i never wanted any part of your night! 
<monica> oh, is that why you did it in the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?! 
<ross> uh, rachel, ive been thinking. i dont think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. im calling it off. 
<chandler>  why to save your dignity my man. 
<rachel>  monica, why? why would i ever want to take away from your night? 
<monica> i dont know! i dontmaybe youre feeling a little resentful. maybe ah, maybe you thought youd get married first! maybe you cant stand the fact that your formerly fat friend is getting married before you! 
<rachel> oh wow. thatyknow what? that is so unfair. yknow what? now i want to steal your thunder! come on ross, lets go have sex!  
<monica>  i cant believe youre gonna have sex on my engagement night!! 
<chandler> well, somebody should.   
<ross> look uh, if were gonna do this 
<rachel> were not gonna do this, all right? shes just gonna think that were doin it. 
<ross> oh, i see, so everybody wins.  
<rachel> who is it? 
<monica>  its monica, open up! 
<rachel> okay well ross! stop it please! wait a minute!  
<ross> oww! 
<rachel> yeah, you like that baby?  may we help you? 
<monica> i just wanted to say that i hope you do have sex tonight and i hope that you guys get back together, but i must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement im going to announce that im pregnant! 
<chandler> how is that ever going to happen?! 
<rachel> all right monica, do you want to know why i was with ross tonight?! 
<monica> i know why! 
<rachel> no you dont know why! 
<monica> okay! why?! 
<rachel> because! because i was sad. 
<monica> what do you mean? 
<rachel> look, i am so so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that im not. im not even close. and i dont know, maybe i just wanted to make myself feel better. and i know that thats dumb, but oh my god you were so depressed when ross got married that you slept with chandler!  
<chandler>  i dont care, she slept with me. 
<rachel> anyway sweetie, i am, im so sorry i ruined your night. 
<monica>  im sorry i almost made you sleep with ross.  
<ross>  well, im going to take off.  congratulations man. 
<chandler> thanks. 
<ross>  and uh, rachel. 
<rachel> yeah. 
<ross> what can i say, you missed your chance. from now on the only person whos going to enjoy these bad boys  is me.  ending credits

<monica> okay!  
<chandler>  already?! 
<rachel> yeah, we got a lot to do! we gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music 
<chandler> oh, i got some thoughts on that.

<ross> take it from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.

<phoebe> well, umm, not much. but, i was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, yknow? so, could i just move in with you for a couple days? 
<ross> umm, okay, yeah, sure. but wh-whats wrong with monica and chandler? 
<phoebe> nothingwhy?!

<phoebe> oh yeah it is! im going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes. 
<ross> do you realize i have a classroom full of students? 
<phoebe>  oh, im sorry. im so rude. does anyone want to come to the movies? 
< 
<monica> all right, so i havent cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music. 
<rachel> okay. 
<monica> all right umm, a string quartet for the procession. 
<rachel> aw. 
<monica> a jazz trio for cocktails. the bay city rollers for dancing. wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding. 
<chandler> well, you couldnt get them anyway. ian doesnt play anymore and derrick  and derrick is a name i shouldnt know. 
<joey>  hey mon, do you have another pillow?  yknow, something a little snugglyer? 
<chandler> why are you napping over here instead of over at your place? 
<joey> well, the duck 
<rachel> what?! the duck?! what the hell did the damn duck do now?! 
<joey> uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up! 
<chandler> now, do i get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding? 
<monica> of course you can look at it! yeah, i want your opinion too! 
<chandler> okay. 
<monica> here you go! what do you think about centerpieces? 
<chandler> centerpieces! 
<monica> yeah! roses or lilies?  
<chandler> definitely roses.  well, i just think theyre a little more weddingy.  but lilies are the clear choice. 
<monica> oh my god! its like one mind. 
<chandler> uh-huh! 
<joey>  guys! guys!! you gotta let me nap! ugh, im gonna get cranky! 
<rachel> joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall! 
<joey> yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick! 
<rachel> what?! 
<joey> all right, im gonna go!  
<rachel> now joey, what did the duck do?! 
<joey> i dont know! but he did not eat your face cream!  
<joey> hey little buddy, how are you feeling?  what the hell is in that face cream?  thats so soft.  pillowcases!   zelda looked at the chimney sweep. her father, the vicar  the vicar?  wouldnt be home for hours. her loins were burning. she threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his  whoa!  whoa-ho-ho-ho! this is a dirty book!  
< 
<ross> uh, phoebe 
<phoebe> oh ross, hi. 
<ross> phoebe, what are you doing? 
<phoebe> im sorry, im with a client right now. 
<ross> phoebe! 
<phoebe> okay, lets talk outside.  
<ross> phoebe, you cant massage people in my apartment! 
<phoebe> whats the big deal? i did it at monica and chandlers! 
<ross> and they knew about it? 
<phoebe>  okay, well ross, what is this really about? 
<ross> look, this is my home and i want to be able to come and go whenever i want! 
<phoebe> okay, i will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. i just dont know what the big deal is! 
<ross> the big deal is i dont want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when i want to kick back with a puzzlebeer! cold beer. 
< 
<rachel> hey joey, what cha doing? 
<joey> sweepin. why? turn you on? 
<rachel> no. 
<joey> huh. what if i was sweeping a chimney? 
<rachel> joey, did you eat my face cream?  
<joey> where are you going? the vicar wont be home for hours.  
<rachel> joey,  where did you learn that word? 
<joey> where do you think,  zelda? 
<rachel>  you found my book?! 
<joey> yeah i did! 
<rachel> joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?! 
<joey> okay, look im sorry, i went in there to take a nap and i know i shouldnt have, but you got porn! 
<rachel> hey-hey, yknow what? i dont care! im not ashamed of my book. theres nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a little erotica. its just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.  
<joey> you got porn! 
< 
<ross> hello. 
<s> hi, is uh phoebe here? 
<ross> uh no-no, she-shes out for the night. 
<s> ohh great. 
<ross> can i, can i help you with something? 
<s> well, i dont know. are you a masseur? 
<ross>  yes i am. 
<s> great!  dad!  thank you so much, ill be back to pick him up in an hour.   
< 
<s> so chandler, your parents mustve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged. 
<chandler> oh yeah, i should probably call them. 
<s> i remember when we first got engaged. 
<chandler> oh, i dont think i ever heard that story. 
<monica> oh dad, really you dont need to 
<s>  well, id gotten judy pregnant. i still dont know how that happened. 
<s>  you dont know how that happened?! your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy! 
<chandler> what a sweet story. 
<monica> well, at least youre not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade halloween party. 
<s> what?! they wanted a scary story! 
<monica> anyway, were really excited about our wedding plans, and well i guess pretty soon well be making a big withdrawal from the monica wedding fund.  what? 
<s> you tell her jack, i cant do it. 
<monica> what happened? you still have the monica wedding fund dont you? 
<s> we have it. only now, we call it the beach house. commercial break 
< 
<monica> i dont believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house! 
<s> were sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 youd pay for it yourself. 
<monica> you bought the beach house when i was 23! 
<s> which means you had seven years of beach fun and you cant put a price on that sweetie. 
<s> we really do feel bad about this though. 
<s> we started saving again when you were dating richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen. 
<monica> what about when i started dating chandler? 
<s> well it was chandler! we didnt think hed ever propose! 
<chandler> clearly i did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.  
<monica> i cant believe it! that there is no money for my wedding?! 
<s> we might still have some money, if your father didnt think it was a good idea to sell ice over the internet. 
<s> it seemed like such a simple idea. 
<s> stupid jack, the word is stupid. 
<s> all right, enough! i dont want to hear about it anymore!  good luck, chandler.  
< 
<ross> okay! now, im going to touch you.  ohh, thats soft.  
< 
<monica> i cant believe this. do you think that your parents could help pay for it? 
<chandler> i dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. shes saving the rest for her divorce. and any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to  dollywood. 
<rachel> well what happened at dinner? 
<monica> my parents spent the money for our wedding! 
<phoebe>  my god! what did you order?! 
<rachel> wait, but theres no money! well this is terrible! you guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center! 
<chandler> honey, its gonna be okay. 
<monica> no! no its not! its not gonna be okay! it sucks! no swing band! no lilies! 
<rachel> no, yknow what? its gonna be okay. i mean you dont have to have this rustic italian feast. yknow? and-and you dont need, you dont need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.  
<chandler> look, it really is gonna be okay. the important thing is that we love each other and that were gonna get married. 
<rachel> do you even understand what off the rack means?! 
<phoebe> look, why dont you just pay for it yourself? 
<monica> how? i dont have any money. 
<chandler> well, i have some. 
<monica> how much? 
<chandler> well, close to  
<monica> whoa!!! are you kidding me?! 
<rachel> well what?! how-how much is it?! 
<monica> its enough for wedding scenario eight. 
<rachel> ohh!  really?! 
<monica>  how great are you, you little saver?! i mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding! 
<rachel>  ohh, you guys are so made for each other. 
<chandler> well, youre not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding? 
<chandler> well, come on, ive been saving this money for six years and i kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party. 
<phoebe>  wow!  hello, mr. chandler. 
<monica> this is the most special day of our lives. 
<chandler> no, i realize that honey, but im not gonna spend all of the money on one party. 
<monica> honey, umm i-i love you,  but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. okay?  listen, we could always earn more money, okay? but uh, were only gonna get married once. 
<chandler> look, i understand, but i have to put my foot down. okay? the answer is no. 
<monica> you-youre gonna have to put your foot down? 
<chandler> yes, i am! 
<phoebe> wow, money and a firm hand. finally a chandler i can get on board with. 
< 
<joey> hey rach. 
<rachel>  joey. 
<joey> hey rach, do you smell smoke? 
<rachel> uh-huh, i get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha. 
<joey> no-no-no, im serious. you dont smell it? somethings on fire. 
<rachel> well no, i dont smell anything. 
<joey> oh, yknow what? its probably just your burnin loins. 
<ross>  hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about? 
<rachel> nothing! 
<ross>  damn, this coffees cold! hey rach, do you mind if i heat this up on your loins?  
<rachel> yknow, i can not believe you told him, joey! 
<ross> so i guess you bought that book after we broke up huh? 
<rachel> uh-huh, yeah i did, because i wore out my first copy when i was with you.  
<ross>  oh yeah, yeah? well uh, when we were going out, i read tons of porno magazines!  sup? 
<phoebe>  ross! how could you do that to an old man?! 
<ross>  excuse me ladies.  im sorry? 
<phoebe> my massage client, arthur? his daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon. 
<ross>  i gave him an extremely professional massage! 
<phoebe> he said you poked at him with wooden spoons. 
<ross> okay, so it wasnt uh, a traditional massage. but i did give him acu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. and, and i gently exfoliated him with, with a mop. 
<phoebe> well, hes never coming back! okay? you just cost me eight dollars a week! 
<ross> hey, yknow what? this is your fault! youre the one that didnt move his-his appointment. 
<phoebe> oh, its my fault?! you didnt have to massage him! you couldve sent him away! you couldve not rolled tonka trucks up and down his back! 
<ross> he said he liked that!! oh youre right, youre right. im sorry. 
<joey> dude, what are you massaging an old man for? 
<ross> his daughter was hot. 
<joey> gotcha. 
< 
<monica> hey. 
<chandler> hey. 
<monica> listen umm, ive been thinking, its not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. i mean, you work, you work really hard for that. 
<chandler> ehh. 
<monica> eh, you work for that. 
<chandler> look, i thought about it too, and im sorry. i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding. 
<monica> you do?! 
<chandler> yeah, im putting my foot down. yeah look, when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then thats what were gonna do. 
<monica> oh, youre so sweet.  oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff? 
<chandler> eh, forget about the future and stuff! so we only have two kids, yknow? well pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college. 
<monica> you thought about that? 
<chandler> yeah. 
<monica> how many kids were we gonna have? 
<chandler> uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy. 
<monica> what else did you think about? 
<chandler> well, stuff like whered we live, yknow? like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. yknow, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. of course, wed have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old. 
<monica>  yknow what? i-i dont want a big, fancy wedding. 
<chandler> sure you do. 
<monica> no, i want everything you just said. i want a marriage. 
<chandler> you sure? 
<monica> uh-hmm. 
<chandler> i love you so much. 
<monica> i love you.  hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right. 
<chandler> oh yeah, totally! 
<monica> oh good. ending credits

<chandler> really? 
<monica> yeah!

< 
<phoebe> so what do you guys want for an engagement present? 
<chandler> thats okay pheebs, were not having a party or anything, so you dont have to get us 
<monica>  if someone wants to give us a present, we dont want to deprive them of that joy. 
<rachel> oh, yknow what you should get em? one of those little uh, portable cd players. 
<monica> oh, i already have one. 
<phoebe> not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist. 
<rachel> yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means joey. 
<monica> hey, i know what i want! 
<chandler> what we want honey. 
<monica> no, you dont want this. i want to have your grandmothers cookie recipe. 
<phoebe> you mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe? 
<monica> uh-huh, yeah. 
<phoebe> you mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that i would never let out of our family? 
<chandler> dying people say the craziest things. 
<monica> i wanted it for years! i was gonna make cookies for my children. 
<phoebe> break my heartoh, all right. 
<monica> okay. im gonna be the mom that makes the worlds best chocolate chip cookies. 
<chandler> our kids are gonna be fat arent they. 
<joey>  ahoy! 
<chandler> hey! hows the boat?! 
<joey> great! im finally getting into this sailing stuff. 
<monica> oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh? 
<joey> why would i do that? it took three guys to get the thing in there! 
<phoebe> if you dont sail your boat, what do you do on it? 
<joey> oh, its great! its a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.  
<chandler> well, its good that you finally have a place to do that. 
<rachel> yknow joey, i could teach you to sail if you want. 
<joey> you could? 
<rachel> yeah! ive been sailing my whole life. when i was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat. 
<phoebe> your own boat? 
<rachel> what?! what?! he was trying to cheer me up! my pony was sick. 
< 
<chandler> do you know what i was thinkin? 
<monica> what? 
<chandler> nothing, i just like to go like this.  
<ross>  hey chandler, what are you doing tonight? 
<chandler> uh why, do you have a lecture? 
<ross> no, why? 
<chandler> then free as a bird. whats up? 
<ross> my dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us. 
<monica> wow! thats great! dad must really like you, he doesnt ask just anyone to play. 
<ross> yeah and he didnt really ask for you, he asked for chancy, i assumed he meant you. 
<chandler> well, did-did you correct him? 
<ross> no, i-i thought it would be more fun this way. 
<monica> this is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week. 
<ross> or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. he does that every week too. 
<monica> oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win. 
<ross> yeah. 
<monica> he hates to lose. 
<chandler> oh no problem, maybe ill play with my left hand. 
<ross> youre not a lefty? 
<chandler> does anybody know me?!  
<monica> whats wrong phoebe? 
<phoebe> i just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up! 
<monica> no!! why didnt you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!! 
<phoebe>  because im normal! that was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and i know you wanted it as an engagement present. 
<ross> oh, we have to get you an engagement present? 
<chandler> dont worry about it pheebs. 
<ross> no one got me an engagement present. 
<phoebe> okay, here i wish you health and happiness.  
<chandler> an old cookie? 
<monica>  this is what happens when you dont register for gifts! 
<phoebe> see no-no, i made a batch and i froze it, and this is the only one left. 
<chandler> we cant accept this. 
<phoebe> why not? 
<chandler> cause its gross. 
<monica> no! wait! i think i can figure out the recipe from this cookie! i do stuff like this at work all the time. 
<phoebe> really?! 
<monica> yeah! i bet i can do it.  
<chandler> okay, we owe you a present. 
<ross> two! ive been engaged twice! 
< 
<joey>  look at this clown! just because hes got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river.  get out of the way jackass!  who names his boat coast guard anyway? 
<rachel> that is the coast guard. 
<joey> what are they doing out here? the coasts all the way over there.  
<rachel> joey, just ignore the boats all right? were not finished with the lesson yet. 
<joey> all right. 
<rachel> okay, im just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready? 
<joey> come on rach, not again. i got it! okay? lets start sailing, and i want to go over there  where that boatload of girls is!  yo-ho-ho! 
<rachel> oh, okay. is that what you want to do? you wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? okay, lets do that sailor joe. quick question though,  whats this called? 
<joey> uh, boat rope. 
<rachel> wrong! how do you get the mainsail up? 
<joey> uh, rub it? 
<rachel> no. what do you do if i say we are coming about? 
<joey> id say, come again. no-no, wait i-i-i know this one, i know this one, uh  
<rachel> times up, now you're dead. 
<joey> and deaf! 
<rachel> okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. am i getting through to you sailor?!  
<joey> yes. 
<rachel> dont just say yes! this isnt a game, joey, you can really get hurt out here. okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?! 
<joey> i want to make a ship to shore call to chandler. 
< 
<monica> all right, i definitely taste nutmeg. 
<phoebe> you do? 
<monica> you dont?  well, thats the difference between a professional and a layman. 
<phoebe> that and arrogance. 
<joey>  hey. 
<monica> hey! how was sailing? 
<joey> i dont want to talk about it. yknow, you couldve at least saved me a whole cookie.  
<joey>  women are mean!!!  
<phoebe> i cant believe that! now the only thing left of my grandmothers legacy is this crumb.  i wish you a long and happy marriage. 
<ross>  hey. 
<monica> hey! how was it? 
<ross> well i had a great time! umm, chancy on the other hand 
<chandler> i will tell the story! it was going great. i let him win. we were bonding. he even said i could call him dad. 
<ross> and what did he ask you not to call him? 
<chandler> daddy. all right look, heres the story.  well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. i walk into the steam room and it was really steamy.  so i take off my glasses and thats when it happened.  
<chandler> guys? 
<ross> over here.  
<s> have a seat son.  hey!!  commercial break 
< 
<monica> oh my god chandler! i cant believe it! 
<chandler> i know. 
<monica> you gave my father a lap dance! 
<chandler> why do they put so much steam in there?! 
<ross> cause otherwise theyd have to call it the room room. 
<chandler> why? okay? why? wh-wh-why did that have to happen? 
<phoebe> come on, its not that big a deal! 
<chandler> not that big a deal? there there was touching of things. 
<ross> now, i know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part? 
<monica> listen, im sure that dad doesnt care. he probably thought this was funny; hell be telling this story for years! 
<chandler> i dont want him to tell this story for years. 
<ross> oh, but he will. he still tells the story how monica tried to escape from fat camp. 
<monica> i wasnt escaping. 
<ross> then how did you get caught in the barbed wire? 
<monica> i was trying to help out a squirrel. 
<ross> you were trying to eat it!  
<chandler> if that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off! 
<monica>  come on.  hello?  im sorry you have the wrong number.  okay, ill call you later dad. i love you.  
< 
<chandler>  all right, im off to see your dad. 
<ross> whoa-whoa, arent you a little over dressed? 
<rachel>  yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time. 
<chandler> look, i figured i would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and i figure the best way to do that is face to faceand by face i dont mean his lap. and by face, i dont mean my ass.  
<ross>  hey are you getting monica and chandler an engagement present? 
<rachel> i dont know. yknow, they didnt get us anything. 
<ross> thank you! 
<joey>  hey. 
<ross> hey. 
<rachel> well hello! so, when are we gettin back out on the water matey? 
<joey> oh uh, i dont know the boat way to say this, but uh never! 
<rachel> why not? 
<joey> because! youre mean on the boat! 
<rachel> what? i was just trying to teach you. 
<joey> well, lesson learned! rachel is mean! 
<ross> yeeeeeep yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. i remember when she took me out on her dads boat she wouldnt let me help at all. 
<rachel> excuse me, i wanted you to help, but you couldnt move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets. 
<ross> you have to respect the sea!  
<rachel> look joey, im sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but i gotta tell ya something. that was not mean. okay, my father is mean. he used to yell at me all the time on the boat, i mean it was horrible. i was just being a good teacher. 
<joey> does a good teacher say, "put down the beer pinhead!?" 
<rachel> well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson? 
<joey> six and a half! you knocked that last one out of my hand! remember? 
<rachel> yeah, i didnt want you to get hit by the boom! 
<joey> well it hit me anyway! and it wouldve hurt a lot less if i had finished that last beer. 
<rachel> all right, yknow what? i-im sorry. i will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling. 
<joey> you wont boss me around anymore? 
<rachel> i wont boss you around. 
<joey> and youll be nice? 
<rachel> and, ill be nice. 
<joey> and youll be topless? 
<rachel> andjoey! 
<joey> do you want me to learn?! 
< 
<monica> okay, heres batch 22. oh, maybe thesell taste a little like your grandmothers. this has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg. 
<ross> lets give it a shot. 
<monica> okay. man, i have not made this many cookies since i was in the ninth grade. 
<phoebe> oh, what was that for? like a bake sale? 
<monica> no, just a friday night.  
<ross> oh, these are pretty good.

<rachel>  no! all right?! i did not see the bird! i did not see the fish! i did not see the piece of styrofoam that was shaped like mike tyson! i did not, because i was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! which obviously is an impossible thing to do! 
<joey> all right thats it! youre yelling and i dont see you taking your top off! i quit! 
<rachel> what do you mean you quit?! you cant quit! 
<joey> why not?! 
<rachel> because youre not finished yet and i wont have it! greens do not quit! 
<joey> greens? im a tribbiani! and tribbianis quit! 
<rachel> oh my god, wait did ii just said greens dont quit didnt i?  did i just say greens dont quit?! 
<joey> yes! yes! you did and youre still yelling at me! 
<rachel> no! no! no! im not yelling at you, im just yelling near you. oh god joey, oh im my father. oh my god, this is horrible! ive been trying so hard not to be my mother i did not see this comin. oh, joey, im sorry. im so sorry. i just wanted you to learn.

<phoebe> yknow, i bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that were trying to figure out her recipe. i bet shes l-l-lookin up at us and smiling right now. 
<ross> looking up? 
<phoebe> oh yeahno, she was really nice to me, but shes in hell for sure. 
<monica> well, ive tried everything. i give up. i guess im not gonna be the mom who makes the worlds best chocolate cookies. i do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.  kids love that right. 
<ross> aww, pheeb, come on isnt there any relative that would have the recipe? what about, what about your sister? 
<phoebe> oh no-no, no, i made a promise to myself that the next time i would talk to ursula would be over my dead body. and thats not happening til october 15th, 2032. 
<ross> thats the day youre gonna die? seedarnit, ive got shuffleboard that day. 
<phoebe> thats what you think. 
<monica> well, i mean what about friends of your grandmothers? wouldnt they have the recipe? 
<phoebe> well, yknow i may have relatives in france who would know. my grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, nesele tolouse. 
<monica> what was her name? 
<phoebe> nesele toulouse. 
<monica> nestle tollhouse?! 
<phoebe> oh, you americans always butcher the french language. 
<monica>  phoebe, is this the recipe?  
<phoebe>  yes!!  oh. 
<monica> i cannot believe that i just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time! 
<phoebe> i know! you see it is stuff like this which is why  youre burning in hell!! 
< 
<chandler> so you understand, id feel a lot more comfortable if you didnt tell people what happened. yknow, im a little im a little embarrassed about it. 
<s> i understand completely, theres nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. as a matter of fact, when i started dating judy i was unemployed, and her father asked me what i did for a living and i told him i was a lawyer. 
<chandler> what did you do when they found out? 
<s> they never did, so if you ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. shall we?  
<chandler> so i guess we wear swimsuits in here! ending credits

<ross> listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okayand f.y.i she mustve shown kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! and his response to each one was, "i dont give a tiny rats ass." 
<phoebe> yeah well, maybe she shouldve spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom. 
<ross> well, i dont think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe thats just because i am not emotionally unavailable! 
<phoebe> you think hes emotionally unavailable? 
<ross> i think he can be. 
<phoebe> well, maybe he wouldnt be if she didnt bring the office home every night! 
<ross> well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life! 
<phoebe> yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing new years eve 1997. 
<ross>  i knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! that was three years ago! she apologized and she apologized! what more do you want?!!

<s> were gonna give it another try. 
<phoebe> what about her whining and her constant need for attention?!

<rachel> me too! 
<monica> first of all um, i love you both so much and youre both so important to me 
<rachel> okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! who is it?! 
<monica> well umm, i was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other. like hypothetically, if phoebe were mine 
<phoebe> yes!!! oh!! 
<rachel> hypothetically! 
<phoebe> still. 
<monica> if phoebe were my maid of honor 
<rachel> uh-hmm. 
<monica> rachel would be phoebes, i would be rachels, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset. 
<rachel> yeah thats actually a pretty good idea. 
<phoebe> yeah, ill do that. so who gets to be yours? 
<monica>  well thats the best part. umm, you guys get to decide! 
<phoebe> wh-why is that the best part? 
<monica> because then i dont have to! 
<rachel> well of course we will help you decide! we will do anything we can to help you! now, i would like to make a toast, to the future mrs. chandler bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that

<phoebe> what are you talking about? 
<joey> like when i want a job, i go to an audition and if im the best of the people they see, they give me the part. 
<phoebe> okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?

<chandler> who? 
<monica> lewis posin! he was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day i asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. do you know why? 
<chandler> because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?! 
<monica> no! but because he thought i was too faaaaa .  and every time i think about it, it makes me feel as bad as i did in fifth grade! yknow, i-i really think that you should apologize to julie. 
<chandler> what? are you kidding? that was like 16 years ago. 
<monica> no, i know. but yknow what? it would make me feel better if lewis apologized to me. 
<chandler> okay, i will do it. but i have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you fell in love with! 
< 
<joey> okay, all right, this is how its going to work. were gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest. 
<ross> no, 10 is the highest. 
<joey> why is 10 the highest?

<joey> no, one man for the rest of my life? i dont know if i can do it! this means ill never get to sleep with joey! 
<rachel> look monica, getting cold feet is very common. yknow, its-its just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love chandler. and also, i ran out on a wedding. you dont get to keep the gifts. 
<joey>  very good! drawing on your own experience, i like that!

<ross> go! 
<rachel> okay! okay! umm, websters dictionary defines marriage as  okay!! forget that! that sucks!! okay, never mind! forget it! umm, umm, okay, uh i met, i-i met, i met monica when we were just a couple of six-year-olds and i became friends with chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six-year-old. 
<rachel> thank you. thank you very much. umm, ive known them separately and ive known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. so i would like to raise my glass  to monica and chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. i can think of no two people better prepared for the journey. 
<joey> wow.  good speech. 
<ross> yeah, it really was! 
<rachel> aw, thanks! 
<ross> okay phoebe, i guess youre next  although i really dont see the point. 
<joey> yeah. 
<phoebe> okay, i cant believe that monica and chandler are getting married. i remember talking about this today with rachel while we were showering together, naked.   
<joey> and shes back in the game. 
< 
<chandler>  julie hi! chandler bing, i, i guess you remember me. 
<s> hello skidmark. 
<chandler>  its a nickname, ill explain later. 
<monica> its pretty clear. 
<chandler> ah, uh, i owe you a long overdue apology. i never should have broken up with you because you were overweight. 
<s> thats why you broke up with me? 
<chandler> you-you-you didnt know that.  well, i guess my work here is done! 
< 
<joey> all right, well first of all i would like to say that you both performed very well. okay? you should be proud of yourselves. and-and i would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. well, except for racheldamnit! 
<phoebe> really?! i won! 
<rachel> what?! 
<ross> im sorry rach, it was, it was really close. 
<rachel> well then i demand a recount!  
<ross> actually, it wasnt that close. 
<rachel> no! yknow what? no! no! you thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculouswere gonna flip a coin!  all right?!  heads!  
<phoebe> the coins have finally forgiven me! 
<rachel> well yknow what? i hope monica forgives you after you throw her her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower!  
<phoebe>  rach, its gonna be okay!  you guys are the best! 
<joey> boy i tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me. 
<ross> yeah? 
<joey> yeah! i was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.  
<ross> why-why would i care about that? 
<joey> no reason, im just saying that uh thats where ill be.  
< 
<chandler> as bad as that went, i actually enjoyed myself. i think that im going to apologize for all of the stupid things i do. 
<monica> why dont you just stop doing stupid things? then you wouldnt have to apologize. 
<chandler> i would really love it if i could do both. 
<monica> all right, i i have to ask. 
<chandler> what? 
<monica> are you gonna break up with me if i get fat again? 
<chandler> what?! 
<monica> well, you broke up with julie grath! how much weight could she have gained? 
<chandler> a hundred and forty-five pounds. 
<monica> in one year?! my god what did she eat? her-her family! thats not the point. 
<chandler> look i know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but i was 15! 
<monica> well thats not the only time this was an issue. you remember when umm, you spent thanksgiving with us? you called me fat. 
<chandler> okay. okay, now wait a minute that was totally different. 
<monica> how? 
<chandler> you were not supposed to hear that! i said that behind you back! 
<monica> what if i have babies, okay? i mean im gonna look different. im okay with that, but im not sure that you are! 
<chandler> look you have to realize i dont think of you as a thin, beautiful woman.  see this is one of things that i can apologize for later! look, what i mean is youre monica! okay? and i am in love with monica. 
<monica> keep going. 
<chandler> so you can balloon up or you can shrink down and i will still love you. 
<monica> even if i shrink down to two inches tall? 
<chandler> id carry you around in my pocket. 
<monica> i love you.  
<chandler> skidmarks still got a way with the ladies. 
< 
<rachel> hi pheebs. 
<phoebe> hi! 
<rachel> hi! i just want to apologize. im really sorry i was a baby. 
<phoebe> thats ridiculous rachel, we were all babies once.  oh, you mean today. 
<rachel> yeah. yeah, and yknow you-you deserve to win. and-and yknow i was thinking about it, if-if youre monicas maid of honor that means i get to be yours. 
<phoebe> oh yeah! 
<rachel> yeah! oh, umm when-when monica and chandler got engaged i started putting some stuff together, yknow just in case 
<phoebe> oh thats so sweet thanks. 
<rachel> here is a book of poetry that i know monica loves. and-and ohh god this is funny, look, this is a picture of one halloween where she dressed up as a bride.  and look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because i was wonder woman. oh and heres a little purse that i found.  yknow i just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there. 
<phoebe> ohh. 
<rachel> and umm, vintage handkerchiefs yknow cause, people cry at weddings.  im just gonna grab a couple of these. 
<phoebe> this stuff is great! 
<rachel> oh, i forgot this was in here. umm, this was the uh garter that i was saving for my wedding and i wanted it to be monicas something borrowed and its blue.  yeah 
<phoebe> yknow rach, i think that, i think you should be monicas maid of honor. 
<rachel> you do? why? 
<phoebe> because i think it means more to you. 
<rachel> but pheebs, yknow you earned it. 
<phoebe> it's fine. i mean, this is something that youve been thinking about since you were what, 14?  
<rachel> no, i was ten. i just developed early. 
<phoebe>  man alive! 
<monica>  hey, whats going on? 
<rachel> hey! 
<phoebe> well, we just decided that rachel is gonna be your maid of honor. 
<monica>  ohh, wow! thats great!  oh wow! we really have to start planning! i have, i have a lot of really specific ideas! we should probably get together like four times per week. you can come over to my place; well get together before work! what do you say,, my place? im so excited!  
<rachel> yeah okay, you laugh now, but shes gonna be yours.  ending credits

<rachel> what-what?! youre gonna leave this person with me?! 
<joey> yeahhey, dont worry, shes a terrific girl. and hey listen, could you do me a favor? when she comes out could you just mention that im not looking for a serious relationship; thatd be great. 
<rachel> why?! what?! are you kidding?! 
<joey> just casually slip it in, yknow lay the groundwork. tell her uh, im a lonerno! an outlaw! tell her she doesnt want to get mixed up with the likes of me. 
<rachel> yknow what? thats a lot to remember, cant i just tell her youre a pig? 
<joey> hey, im gonna call her later! honest! oh come on, chandler used to do it! hed even make the girl pancakes! plus, hed make extras and leave em for me. 
<rachel> well forget it, im not telling that girl anything. that is not my responsibility. 
<joey> fine!  now, whered we land on those pancakes?  
<rachel> hi. the door. 
<rachel> yeah, joey kinda disabled it when i moved in.

<chandler> wow thats actually pretty cool. 
<ross>  oh umm, theres also a book here by a woman named wendy bagina.  what is that? 
<chandler> sounds like two people are really enjoying the dewey decimal system.  
<chandler> you didnt bring me here to do that, did you? 
< 
<monica> she sent the chicken back again?! 
<s> she says its too dry now and she wants to come back here and explain to you exactly how she wants it.

<monica> well, she actually has a boyfriend yknow herself, named clark. uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. clark too. 
<chandler>  you said no, right? 
<monica> huh? 
<chandler> you said no, right?! 
<monica> well, she cornered me! she asked if the wedding was in town! i mean, what was i supposed to do?!

<monica> come on! so she comes to the wedding! i mean it wont be so bad. 
<chandler> what do you think, shes just gonna sit there quietly? you dont think shes gonna want to make a toast? you dont think shes gonna want to grab the microphone and sing part-time lover?! 
<monica> oh my god, shes not gonna like the chicken that night either, is she?! 
<chandler> yknow what? its gonna be okay. yknow what? shes probably not gonna even want to come. 
<monica> really? 
<chandler> no! that was a lie! see how easy that was? 
<monica> so-so you wouldve just lied? 
<chandler> yes!! 
<monica> would it really have been that easy?

<rachel> yeah, there was. it wasthere the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever readyes, there was. 
<ross> great! because people kept showing up, i think its like uh-a thing!

<ross> no! no!! no! can i speak to someone in charge please?!  
<ross> hi, i was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the paleontology section? see i-i wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it. to look at the previous librarian.) but as far as increasing security, im afraid the library is very understaffed. i, i cant help you. 
<ross> well, fine. fine! if-if im the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, ill go up there and defend it myself!  and dont you follow me! 
< 
<joey> hey. 
<phoebe> hey! 
<rachel> how did it go with erin? 
<joey> oh, unbelievable! we had the best time!

<phoebe> so how was, how was your date? 
<joey> oh, it was great! i mean we walked all around the village. we went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still and guess what, im thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts. 
<phoebe> oh really? she said she wants to go away with you? 
<joey> no-no-no-no-no! its a surprise, but its gonna be tricky though because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while. 
<rachel> jo-joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? umm, i kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, shes not lookin for a serious relationship. 
<joey> where are you gettin this? 
<rachel> well, she told me. she said shes kind of a loner.

<monica> janice, what umm, what are you doing here? 
<s> well umm, i thought i was going to go back to my apartment but then i just felt i couldnt really be alone tonight.  i was wondering if i could maybe stay here with you, just i really feel that i need to be with family. 
<monica>  our kids are gonna call her aunt janice arent they? 
<s> please, its because otherwise i really dont know what i might do. 
<chandler> arent you just a tinsy bit curious? 
<s>  do you have any tissues? 
<monica> yeah, in-in-in the bathroom. 
<s> okay!  
<monica> well just well just let her stay. 
<chandler> no-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever! 
<monica> kinda like your barcalounger. 
<chandler> is that what youre thinking about right now? 
<monica> i never stop thinking about it. 
<s> hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before i take my bath. 
<chandler> janice, im sorry but umm, you cant stay here tonight. 
<s> why not? 
<chandler> honestly? our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. now monica and i have been immunized, but sadly you have not.  
<s> okay, im going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise i get very nasal.  do you have a cat? cause its already happening.  do you hear that?   
<monica> oh my god! oh my god! you have to go! 
<s> why? 
<monica> because chandler still has feelings for you! 
<s> he does? 
<chandler> say again? 
<monica> thats right. thats right. and that is why you cant stay here tonight. and probably why you shouldnt come to the wedding. 
<chandler> feelings, such strong feelings. 
<monica> i mean, i realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can. 
<s> oh my gawd, i-i understand. i-i am so sorry, ill go.  good-bye monica , i wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. chandler,  you call me when this goes in the pooper.  ending credits

<ross>  dont sweat it, ive got this section covered. yeah, in fact ive got this little baby  to shine in peoples eyeokay, see you later.  
< 
<ross>  hey everybody! happy thanksgiving! 
<chandler> no, no, no. no-no-no. 
<ross> what, are we keeping thanksgiving a secret this year? 
<chandler> no, we're playing this game i learned at work. you have to name all the states in six minutes. 
<ross> what? that's like insanely easy! 
<chandler> now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. you always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen . 
<monica> it's a stupid game and i wasn't playing against other people, so technically i didn't lose. 
<ross> what? you forgot fourteen states? 
<monica> nobody cares about the dakotas.   
<chandler> oh, okay, time's up! 
<rachel> all right, i got 48. 
<chandler> oh that's not bad, pheebs? 
<phoebe> oh, i got tired of naming states. so i decided to list the types of 
<chandler> okay, so rachel's got 48 and phoebe has the lead in vegetables, joey? 
<joey> say hello to the new champ of chandler's dumb states game. 
<ross> wow, how many have you got? 
<joey> fifty-six! opening credits 
< 
<joey> hey! how is new england not a state? huh? they have a sports team! 
<chandler> does south oregon have a sports-team?  there you go.  
<rachel>  how come we have one extra place setting? 
<monica> 'cause you invited your assistant. 
<rachel> oh, right. sorry. but tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending thanksgiving with her. 
<monica> oh! why didn't you tell me? i made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin. 
<rachel> well, i was going to, but then i figured, you know... your food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things. 
<monica> now you think i wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake,  but i still do. 
<phoebe> regular celery!  oh, i already have that.  
<ross> done! with time-a to spare. 
<chandler> oooh that may be a new world's record  
<ross> you know, i hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and joey can't name all the states. did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" hmm? 
<chandler> uh, magellan? you got 46 states.  
<ross> what? that's impossible. 
<joey> 46. wow! who's well educated now, mr. i-forgot-ten-states? 
<monica> all right, i'm out of oven space. i'm gonna turn on joey's. please, watch him! do not let joey eat any of the food! 
<chandler> i am only one man!  okay ross, time is up! 
<ross> no, just give me another minute. 
<chandler> look ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? that is the beauty of this game. it makes you want to kill yourself. 
<ross> this-this is crazy! i can do this! all right, uhh, i bet i can get all 50 before dinner. 
<chandler> okay, but if you can't no dinner! 
<ross> you're on! 
<joey>  all right. don't look at my list, ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have. 
<monica>  hey, did you guys know that your oven doesn't work? 
<joey> but the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right? 
<monica> ross, i'm gonna use yours, okay? 
<ross> pshhshhh! 
<monica> chandler? can you give me a hand?  
<chandler> sure, and joey; do not let ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment. 
<joey> don't worry, chandler, it's not a globe of the united states.  
<phoebe> hey you guys i'm gonna go out and take a walk. 
<ross> phoebe, why is your bag moving? 
<phoebe> oh, it's not! 
<rachel> seriously, it's moving! 
<joey> what the hell is in there? 
<phoebe> it's just my knitting that's all!  yes! i knit this. i'm very good. 
< 
<monica> rosss apartment is nice! how come we don't hang out here more often? 
<chandler> i don't know. maybe it's because it smells a little weird. it's like old pumpkins or something. 
<monica> that's my pie! 
<chandler> which smells delicious! 
<monica> uh-oh! uh-oh! 
<chandler> what? 
<monica> we left joey alone with the food!  yep! yep, i knew it! there he is... feeding stuffing to a dog! 
< 
<phoebe>  hi geller-bing residence. how can i help? 
<monica> phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment? 
<phoebe> i'm sorry, who's this? 
<monica> phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch! 
<chandler> tell her, i'm allergic, and i will sue! 
<phoebe> no, there's no dog here? 
<monica> yes there is! he's black and white and shaggy and  he's sitting next to rachel and licking rachel's hand. 
<phoebe> oh my god! where are you?  
<monica> i'll be right there! 
<phoebe>  they're here already? how are they doing this? 
<rachel>  hi tag! what are you doing here? 
<s> i, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend thanksgiving with you is still good. 
<rachel> well, sure! come in!  well, what-what happened to your girlfriend? 
<s> we kinda broke up this morning. 
<rachel> oh, i'm sorry. 
<s> yeah, so she went back to ohio. 
<ross> ohio!! thank you! 
<chandler> huh! where is the dog?! 
<ross> what dog? there-there's no dog here. 
<joey> yeah that dog left! 
<monica>  phoebe! phoebe, open up! 
<phoebe> there's no dog in here.  
<chandler> phoebe, we can hear the dog barking! 
<phoebe> no that's just me coughing!  oh, good, there you are! listen, um, i have a dog in my room. 
<chandler> what is it doing here? 
<phoebe> well, i'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. wait.  hello, my name is clunkers. may i please stay with you nice people? 
<monica> oooh, i wish she could stay here, but chandler is allergic! 
<chandler> extremely allergic, okay? if i'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up! 
<phoebe> that's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days 
<chandler>  really? 
<monica> chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog? 
<chandler> well, it still has to go, right? 
<chandler> okay, it's um 
<joey>  don't do it! 
<monica> don't do what? 
<chandler>  i have to! okay? it's time!  okay, i hate dogs. 
<s> what? 
<phoebe> are you crazy? 
<ross> are you out of your mind? 
<phoebe> why? 
<joey> told ya.  
<chandler> they are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit. 
<ross> right, they are scary.  ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!! 
<rachel> wait a minute. do you not like all dogs? i mean, not even puppies? 
<chandler>  is there a puppy here? 
<s> you don't like puppies? 
<chandler>  okay, you are new! 
<joey> look, chandler, i told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. it's like ross not likin ice cream. 
<phoebe> you don't like ice cream? 
<ross> it's too cold. 
<chandler> okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable. 
<ross>  it hurts my teeth. 
<chandler> and i don't wanna say this, i don't want you guys to hate me, but uh, i don't think, i can be around that dog anymore. okay, so either the dog goes, or i go.  oh my god!! 
<ross> how can i not get this? i'm a college professor; i got 1450 on my s.a.t.s. 
<monica> 1250. 
<ross> damn, i forgot you were here. 
<phoebe> all right. we're gonna take clunkers to rosss. we'll be back in a minute.  
<rachel> oh, wait before you guys go, can i just ask you a question? 
<monica> yeah. 
<rachel> when a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move? 
<phoebe> oh, i'd say about a month. 
<monica> really? i'd say 3 to 4. 
<joey> half hour.  
<rachel> interesting. 
<monica> when it's your assistant, i would say never. 
<joey> all right, rach, the big question is, does he like you? all right? because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point. 
<rachel> huh. a moo-point? 
<joey> yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. it just doesn't matter. it's moo. 
<rachel>  have i been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense? 
<monica> please, don't listen to joey, okay. would you look at him? he-hes obviously depressed. he's away from his family; he's spending thanksgiving with strangers. what he needs right now is for you to be his friend. 
<rachel> you're right, i'm sorry. thank you. okay, that's what i'm gonna do. 
<joey> fine! take their advice. no one ever listens to me. when the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.  
<rachel> hey! 
<s> hey. 
<rachel> how are you holding up? 
<s> not bad. 
<rachel> yeah? i'm sorry about your girlfriend. 
<s> thanks. 
<rachel> so were you guys together a long time? 
<s> a year. on and off. i kinda thought we'd end up together. i don't anymore. 
<rachel> now that she broke up with you? 
<s> yeah. 
<rachel> yeah. hmmmm. 
<s> it's weird. i always used to assume, that i would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. but lately it's like what if it's not. do you ever have that feeling? 
<rachel> no yeah, all the time, constantly. it's terrifying. but you know that i figure it it has to work out. 
<s> why? 
<rachel> because, uhit has to. 
<s> you have all the answers, don't you? 
<rachel> yeah, i know, i do. i really do. 
<s> hey, thanks for talking to me. 
<rachel> well, what is a boss for? hug it out!  
<joey>  all right, he likes you back! huh? told ya, you should go for it! 
<s> what? 
<joey>  street noise drowned any of that out?  no, all right, i see you later, okay...  commercial break 
< 
<s> what did joey say? i like you back? 
<rachel> uh, yeah, well, see, he joey knows, that i'm-i'm very insecure about my back and, and you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah! 
<s> wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense. 
<rachel> no?  all right, here's the truth um, joey said what he said, because um, i'm attracted to you. 
<s> wow.  
<rachel> yeah, i admit it. i have a crush on you, and uh, and, and i know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing i want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now. 
<s>  oh my god! those guys are stealing my car!  
<rachel> what? 
<s> right there! that's my car!  hey!! 
<rachel> okay, that's gonna take them a minute. do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest? 
<s> i can't believe this!  
<rachel>  wait, we still have time to talk and theyre-they're not even in the car yet!  oh look, there they go, okay.  
< 
<monica> okay phoebe, we should probably go back now. 
<phoebe>  please don't leave me, i'll be lonely. 
<monica> stop it. stop! okay let's go. we can be strong. 
<phoebe> yeah, okay.  
<monica> oh my god! did you hear that? she said monica!  oooh, i can't leave her! 
<phoebe> you know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and chandler wouldn't even know. 
<monica> that's not gonna work. 
<phoebe> i've had that dog there for three days and chandler had no idea. he's not so smart. 
<monica> hey! i didn't know either. 
<phoebe> yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you? 
<monica> yeah, i knew. 
< 
<phoebe> where's chandler? 
<chandler>  here i am. 
<phoebe> wash your hands!!! 
<chandler> how did you know?   
<ross> hey! what's she doing back here? 
<monica> relax, ross. she's not made of ice cream! 
<ross> hey look, phoebe. i, uh, i laid out the states geographically... 
<phoebe>  no, no, we don't really have time for this right now. okay, we have to keep chandler away from my bedroom. 
<ross> yeah, but, but look what i'm... 
<phoebe> see, this is exactly what we do not have time for.  
<chandler>  where's monica? 
<ross> um, in phoebe's room. you can't go in there. 
<chandler> why not?  
<ross> monica's crying. she's very upset about this whole clunkers thing. 
<chandler> well, i, i should go in there. 
<ross> no. no, no. she doesn't want to see you right now. 
<chandler> why not? 
<ross> because you sent away the dog! 
<chandler> this is ridiculous.  
<ross> oh, is it? is it? look, when monica and i were kids, we had a dog named rover. and, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. so monica and her friend phyllis take away the dog. and that was the last time we ever saw him. don't you see? this is just like that. only with a few details changed. 
<joey>  okay, i'm in my sweat pants. bring on the food!  what's the matter? 
<chandler> monica's all upset, because i sent clunkers away. 
<joey> so? bring the dog back, you're a hero. 
<chandler> yeah, i can be a hero, i could do that. i could, i could do... i, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me? 
<joey> chandler, it's like a big gerbil. 
<chandler> and that doesn't scare you?  
<joey> ross, you need some help? 
<ross> from you?  yes, please! 
<joey>  first of all, utah? dude, you can't just make stuff up! 
<ross> i hate america! when i finish this game, i swear i am moving.  
<joey> hey! tag's still talking to the police. 
<rachel> yeah, ohh! why, damnit, why did i open my mouth?  i have a crush on you; i am attracted to you.  gee, i-i know that i freaked him out 
<joey> if you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.  
<phoebe>  hey, is chandler here? 
<chandler> no, no he went for a walk. 
<phoebe> okay, but you cannot tell him... but look who's back!  
<rachel>  hi! 
<joey> oh no-no-no-no-no-no-no! he went over to ross' to bring the dog back here! 
<phoebe> oh no, the dog's not going to be there! 
<joey> you think?  
<monica> hi, honey. 
<chandler> please, please, please, don't be mad at me. 
<monica> what? why, why would... 
<phoebe>  shh, wait and see. maybe we will, maybe we won't. 
<chandler> okay, i went over to ross' apartment to bring back clunkers. yknow, for you, and  i left the door open and she must have gotten out and i looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which fyi ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. i couldn't find him, and i am so, so, so, sorry. but i do know where we could all go ease the pain.  
<phoebe> we have good news, look who's back! 
<rachel>  hi! 
<chandler> clunkers?! oh my god! 
<monica> that's right, she came back all by herself. 
<phoebe> it's a thanksgiving miracle! 
<chandler>  it is so good to see you! 
<phoebe> yeah, she came all the way back from ross' building. oh, the things she must have seen! and then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in  i went too far, didn't i? when should i have stopped? 
<ross> okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. let me tell you something, i have 49 states, and there are no more! i-i think, i should be able to eat something. 
<chandler> it's up to you.  
<rachel> oh, hi! how are you doing? 
<s> i'm okay. i gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots. 
<rachel> oh. 
<s> thanks for having me over, you guys. 
<ross> tag? y-you're going?  uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. uh, so, where did you say you're from again? 
<s> colorado. 
<ross> ah, what good are you.   
<rachel> look, um, i think we should talk about what happened on the terrace. 
<s> okay. 
<rachel> ah, i-i never should have said what i said. ityknow what? it just doesn't matter how i feel. i mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what i would love is just to go to work on monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? big day monday lots to do. so, we're okay? 
<s> um, i'm not. 
<rachel> oh, god, i knew it, that i freaked you out. 
<s> no, you didn't. the only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us. 
<rachel> really? 
<s> yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this.  
<rachel> okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on monday. ending credits

<chandler> okay. okay. 
<ross> yes! yes! yes!!  
<phoebe> his first big kids bike, this is so exciting! 
<monica> oh yeah, i remember mine! ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, i got it, and it bent. 
<ross> yeah. 
<phoebe> i never had a bike of my own. 
<ross>  what?! 
<phoebe> well, we didnt have a lot of money. but the girl across the street had the best bike! it was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on. 
<chandler> that sounds like my first bike.  my dad gave me his old one. 
<ross> ohh. 
<monica> did the girl ever let you ride it? 
<phoebe> no! but she gave me the box that it came in. it had a picture of the bike on the front.  so i would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard. 
<ross> that is so unfair! 
<phoebe> not really, i got to drag him around too!  opening credits 
< 
<chandler> hey! what are you guys doing?

<monica> see? this is exactly why im making this candy. we can learn their names and get to know our neighbors. 
<chandler> wouldnt it be easier if we just moved? 
<rachel>  gooood morning!!

<chandler> i am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work!  he does not know that i am not some of us. 
<monica> umm, listen i am sorry, but ill put some out first thing in the morning.

<rachel>  okay please, youre kidding right?! i wrote that one as a joke for you! 
<s> a joke they would appreciate? 
<rachel> im thinkin no. 
<s> what did you say?! 
<rachel> umm, i said i thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that i like your tiney-tiny tushie. 
<s> no, not my tushie. 
<rachel> well, it gets worse. when asked if you take initiative i wrote, "yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under problems with performance i wrote, "dear god, i hope not," and then uh, then i drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch. 
< 
<monica> ross! that is so sweet of you to get phoebe that bike! when i heard the story, i almost cried. 
<joey> almost cried huh? hear that chandler? almost cried! 
<chandler> hey, you cry every time somebody talks about titanic! 
<joey>  those two only had each other! 
<ross> phoebe really likes the bike huh? 
<monica> oh yeah! i saw her walkin it down the street the other day. she had uh, these flowers in the basket. it was so cute.

<phoebe> of course! 
<monica> umm, can we see you ride it? 
<phoebe> okay.  see? commercial break 
< 
<monica> see, this is why i told you never get involved with your assistant! and there is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs.  did you hear that chandler? no such thing! 
<chandler>  what happened? im just eating candy. 
<rachel> maybe its not as bad as i think. yknow, maybe they didnt take it the way i meant it. 
<chandler> absolutely! yknow, because tushie can mean both ass and good worker. 
<rachel> ugh, i just gotta get the thing back! 
<joey> hey rach? 
<rachel> yeah? 
<joey> that sketch you mentioned? might it have looked a little something like this?  
<rachel> oh my god! joey! 
<chandler> what is the matter with you? 
<rachel> ugh! 
<joey> boy i tell ya, this little talent came in handy before i could afford porn.  candy. 
<monica> im sorry, i cant help you. see?  rules are rules. all about your candy! 
<monica> no kidding, out of towners huh? what did you tell em? 
<monica> some people have been saying its yknow little drops of heaven, but whatever. 
<joey>  hey chandler, do we know that lady? 
<chandler> maybe, isnt she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud? 
<monica>  all right, ill do it just this once! but you cant tell anybody! 
<monica>  its unbelievable! i-i cant believe that sign didnt work! 
<chandler> yknow what would work? 
<monica> hmm? 
<chandler> stop making candy! 
<monica> but they like it! 
<chandler> you mean they like you. 
<monica> maybe. 
<chandler> is that why you became a chef? so that people would like you? 
<monica> oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?  
< 
<ross> okay, now just remember everything i taught you and youll be fine. okay? here we go. ready set 
<phoebe>  wait! this seat is really uncomfortable! yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. perhaps, like an airplane seator a beanbag chair! 
<ross> phoebe, you cant get out of this! okay? you have to learn how to ride a bike! 
<phoebe> why? why do i have to learn? 
<ross> well in-in case of emergency. 
<phoebe> what kind of an emergency? 
<ross> well let therewhat if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "you ride this bike or ill sh ill shoot you." 
<phoebe> okay, i would ring the bell to distract him and then i would knock the gun out of his hand with a chinese throwing star. 
<ross> okay, phoebe just-just get-get on the bike andhey! ill hold you up and-and push you. okay? 
<phoebe> you wont let go? 
<ross> no! 
<phoebe> swear?! 
<ross> i swear! 
<phoebe>  okay. 
<ross> come on.  all right, here we go. all right?

<phoebe> okay.  
<ross> thats it, your doing great. 
<phoebe> okay. 
<ross> doing great! yes-yes-yes! take control! yes! 
<phoebe> weee!!!  
<ross> yes!! yes!!!  
<phoebe> oh! oh! oh no!! you swore! 
<ross> i-i just thought you were doing so well. i 
<phoebe> i am shocked! shocked!!  
<ross> its a legitimate learning technique.  wow! 
< 
<ross> hey, theres uh, some people outside, askin about candy. 
<monica> well, theyre just gonna have to wait arent they? ive only got two hands!! 
<ross> need some help? 
<monica> no! you dont know the system! therell be nobody messing with the system! 
<ross> by the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.   
<phoebe>  oh, hello liar. 
<ross>  look, i-im really sorry i let go of the bike. 
<phoebe> i couldve been killed i hope you know! 
<ross> i know. i know. but, can we please try it again? huh? i mean, you were so close phoebe! 
<phoebe> well, i would love to but the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.  
<ross> phoebe. 
<phoebe> what?!  what the hell?! 
<ross> all right, yknow what? if you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then im sorry, im just gonna have to take it back. 
<phoebe> what?! why?! 
<ross> because! because, it-it-its itd be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. okay, this guitar wants to be played! and-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you dont ride it you-youre-youre killing its spirit!  the bike is dying. 
<phoebe> all right. if you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay. 
<ross> great! great!  youre making the bike very happy. 
<phoebe>  okay ross!  please dont die! 
< 
<rachel> okay, i think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but were gonna have to get into mr. zelners office. now, he doesnt get in until 10, so hes no problem, but his assistant, betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk. 
<s> thats kinda sad. 
<rachel> yeah, well betty is kinda sad. which is why i believe i can lure her away with these chocolates.  now, while i distract her, you get in the office. 
<s> got it! 
<rachel> lets roll!  
<rachel>  yeah, sure mr. zelner, for you anythingminute. okay. fine.  abort the plan, abort the plan.

<rachel> youre lookin at it upside downyknow what?  it doesnt matter. hell, i even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. but theres a time and a place, huh?! unless you uh, have a limerick right now?  no? okay, well uh, youve  got my fax number.  
<rachel> whoa! i cant believe you did that. that was really sweet. 
<s> no, dont worry about it.

<monica> are you gonna dress up as santa? 
<ross> nope. i mean, i know susan does every year, but i think i wanna take this year to teach him all about hanukkah. 
<phoebe> and maybe i could teach ben about the christmas skull and how people die. 
<rachel> you may need to use this year to teach ben about phoebe. 
<ross> hmm.  
<joey> hey.  
<rachel>  did you know he was in there? 
<monica> no. 
<chandler> how long have we been home?

<chandler> well, she's just so much fun with joey, i just assumed, she'd still be living with him. 
<phoebe> why do you think she's having so much fun living with joey? 
<chandler> no reason, except she told me. 
<phoebe> really? so she said, she didnt wanna live with me anymore? 
<chandler> no! no, she didn't say that. i-i-i think you should talk to monica now. 
<monica> phoebe, don't worry about it. i'm sure she wants to live with you. 
<phoebe> you're sure? you're absolutely sure? 
<monica> well, no. but, um, i bet she probably does. 
<phoebe> probably? yeah, i don't like that word.  kind of what probably really means. yeah, uh-huh. yeah, oh, "your mom probably won't kill herself," yknow? i'm sorry, but i'm not hanging all my hopes of rachel and i living together on-on "probably!" yknow? you gotta take care of yourselves!  in this world history teaches us nothing!

<chandler> is this because of the burrito thing? 
<monica>  you need to give him money.

<monica> no, to get a table! places like this are always shakin you down. everybody wants to be paid off. 
<chandler> right, calm down, o'mally. i'll slip him some money. 
<monica> you've got to be smooth about it. 
<chandler> hey, i can be smooth.  listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, i'd appreciate it.  
<s> of course, sir. 
<chandler> okay.

<s> christmas eve. 
<ross> yes, but also  hanukkah! see, you're part jewish, and-and hanukkah is a jewish holiday. 
<s> santa has reindeers that can fly! 
<ross> right, um, but, on hanukkah, hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. see, years and years ago there were these people called the maccabees. 
<s>  jingle bells, jingle bells... 
<ross>  okay, that's right, yes, but on hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh  draydl, draydl, draydl, i made you out of clay. 
<s>  rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer... 
<ross>  okay, it's not a contest. 
<s> when is santa coming?

<chandler> mustached bastard 
<monica>  okay, those people just left, come on! quick! give him the money and get their table!

<joey> hey-hey, pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.  ready? one, two, three, four...  
<phoebe> that's fun.  commercial break

<joey> thank you.  hey pheebs! 
<phoebe> hey! 
<joey> here.  now i only owe you $49.50. 
<chandler> hey pheebs! 
<phoebe> hey!  
<chandler> if you wanna give joey a christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway? 
<monica> it's not just the drum noise. every five minutes, joey throws his sticks in the air, and i have to hear, "oh my eye! oh god, my eye!" i mean, it is so annoying. 
<phoebe> yes, thank you. you see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums. 
<monica> phoebe, you got joey drums to annoy rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore? 
<phoebe> maybe on some level. 
< 
<rachel> joey, yknow that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air. 
<joey> what is rock 'n' roll about that? 
<phoebe>  hey, joey, i got you another present.  
<joey> oh wait, before you tell me what it is!  okay, what is it? 
<phoebe> it's a tarantula!  oh! god! rachel, look, i'm sorry. what was i thinking giving joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage? 
<rachel> what are you talking about? i love them!  yeah, i had a tarantula when i was a kid. but it-it died, because my cat ate it. and then, then my cat died. but joey, isn't this cool? 
<joey> is it on me? i feel, i feel like it's on me! i got, hey!  
<rachel> oh, isn't that adorable? joey is afraid of the tarantula. 
<phoebe>  ah, yeah, he's so adorable, god, he's just so much fun, joey is the best, i'm glad you're having so much fun here.  
<rachel> what? wait-wait a minute, what? phoebe, what's the matter? 
<phoebe> our apartment is ready. 
<rachel> and that makes you angry because 
<phoebe> because you would rather live here with joey. 
<rachel> where did you get that? 
<phoebe> monica and chandler said that you were having so much fun here. and apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that. 
<rachel> phoebe? 
<phoebe> hm? 
<rachel> did you get all this stuff for joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out! 
<phoebe>  fish! 
<rachel> it wouldn't have mattered anyway, phoebe, you and i are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal. 
<phoebe> yes, but i wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here 
<rachel> oh, it's so much more fun with you. 
<phoebe> we did have fun, didn't we? 
<rachel> we did! 
<phoebe> oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.

<monica> what happened to santa, holiday armadillo? 
<ross>  santa was unavailable so close to christmas. 
<monica> wow, come in, have a seat. you must be exhausted coming all the way from texas.

<ross> that's right, ben. i'm santa's representative for all the southern states. and mexico! but, santa sent me here to give you these presents, ben.  maybe the lady will help me with these presents.  
<s> wow! thanks! 
<ross> you're welcome, ben. merry christmas, ooh, and happy hanukkah! 
<s> are you for hanukkah, too? because i'm part-jewish.

<chandler> what? 
<s> did you bring me any presents, santa? 
<chandler> you bet i did, ben, put it there!  well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small!  ho, ho, ho! 
<monica> okay ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and santa, the armadillo, and i have a little talk in the kitchen? there's a sentence, i never thought i'd say.  
<ross>  what are you doing? 
<chandler> you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a santa costume, so i borrowed one from a guy at work! 
<ross> thank you, but, but you gotta leave. 
<chandler> why? 
<ross> because, i'm finally getting him excited about hanukkah, and, and you're-youre wrecking it. 
<chandler> but i didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly. 
<ross> i'm sorry, chandler but this, this is really important to me. 
<chandler> fine, i'll give the suit back.  
<monica>  hey, you think, you can keep it another night?  
<chandler> santa? really? 
<monica> yes, is that okay? 
<chandler> did your dad ever dress up like santa? 
<monica> no. 
<chandler> then it's okay!  
<ross> okay ben, santa has to go. say good-bye! 
<s> no! why does he have to go? 
<chandler> because, if santa and the holiday armadillo?  ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. merry christmas! 
<s> no! why can't the armadillo leave? i want santa! 
<ross> fine, i-i give up. santa, santa can stay. 
<chandler> well, i'll stay, but only because i wanna hear about hanukkah. ben, will you sit here with santa and learn about hanukkah? 
<s> okay, santa!

<rachel>  oh my god! 
<phoebe> what? 
<rachel>  okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms? 
<phoebe> yeah? 
<rachel> and remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down? 
<phoebe> yeah? 
<rachel> do you really not know where im going with this?  it left! its one huge room! 
<phoebe> oh no!  oh! wow!!! 
<rachel> see? 
<phoebe> well, i guess well just have to put the wall back up. 
<rachel> you cant, because of the new skylight! 
<phoebe> theres a skylight?!  wow!! 
<rachel> so what should we do? should we start looking for a new place? 
<phoebe>  yknow im-im sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that. 
<rachel> oh yeah? startin to feel her again there are we? 
<phoebe> a little bit, yeah. 
<rachel> pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone? 
<phoebe> you heard her too?! you have the gift! 
<rachel> phoebe, its okay. i like living with joey. 
<phoebe> are you sure? 
<rachel> oh please, i hate packing, its closer to work, and we do have fun. although, im really gonna miss living with you. 
<phoebe> oh me too. 
<rachel> i know.  oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? listen, im gettin something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give rachel the purple chair? 
<phoebe> no, i do not hear that. 
< 
<ross> and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that shouldve just lasted just one day, burned for 
<s>  eight whole days. 
<ross> thats right, and thats why we celebrate hanukkah today. the end. 
<s> awesome! 
<ross> yeah? 
<chandler> my favorite part was when superman flew all the jews out of egypt.  
<ross> the armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! okay ben, its time to light the hanukkah candles!  
<rachel>  hey! 
<phoebe> oh. 
<rachel>  wow! it looks like the easter bunnys funeral in here. 
<ross> come on, come on, were-were-were lighting the candles! 
<rachel> oh. 
<phoebe> oh.  
<phoebe> okay, i understand why superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the easter bunnys funeral? ending credits

<rachel> i got it! 
<joey>  is it back in the cage? 
<rachel> its back in cage!

< 
<chandler> ohh. mmm. 
<rachel>  hi. 
<chandler> hey, you have got to try this cheesecake. 
<rachel> oh, yknow i'm not that much of a sweet tooth. iwow. my god, so creamy. oh my god, this is the best cheesecake i have ever had. where did you get this?  
<chandler>  it was at the front door. when i got home. somebody sent it to us. 
<rachel> chandler, this is not addressed to you. this is addressed to mrs. braverman downstairs.  thief. 
<chandler> ino! i didn't read the box before i opened it. and you can't return a box after you've opened the box. 
<rachel> why, why not? 
<chandler> because it's too delicious. 
<rachel> chandler, you stole this cheesecake. that is wrong. 
<chandler> no-no-no! it is going to be okay, because mrs. braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! the only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate,  mommas little bakery.  i feel terrible, im a horrible, horrible, horrible person. 
<rachel>  oh, im sorry, what? opening credits 
< 
<joey> all right, i should get going, big day at work. yknow im in a coma? today, they do this test on me and it turns out im not brain dead. 
<chandler> so 
<joey> ah-ah-ah mr. smartie pants, its just my character thats not brain dead. hey, so pheebs, we still on for tonight? 
<phoebe> absolutely! 
<joey> ill see you at eight. 
<phoebe> okay.  
<chandler> oh, whats at eight? 
<phoebe> oh, i have dinner plans with joey. we get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys. 
<ross> wow, did not know that! may i say how lovely you look today? 
<phoebe> duly noted. 
<ross> thanks.  oh! so for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what? 
<monica> what are you talking about? 
<ross> cousin frannies wedding, it's tomorrow night. 
<monica> you were invited?! 
<ross> no. 
<monica> my god, i cant believe this! i mean i knew that mom and dad were invited, but i thought that was it! i mean from the ages 7 to 9 frannie and i were inseparable! 
<chandler> well, maybe since the age of 9, frannies made some new friends. 
<ross> well l-look okay, its probably just a mistake. let me call aunt sheryl okay? maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail. 
<monica> yeah, well you call her and tell her that yknow when we were kids her precious little frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? and if i hadnt have stopped her, there probably wouldnt even be a wedding to go to. 
<ross> yknow, she tried to undress me too. 
<chandler> i used to undress my cousin glenn.  
< 
<phoebe> joseph francis tribbiani are you home yet?!! 
<rachel> umm, i think hes still out. whats wrong? 
<phoebe> well, ill tell you rachel karen green, i had plans with joey tonight and he left me this note.  
<rachel>  "pheebs, cant make it, got a date. talk to you later. big daddy."  big daddy? 
<phoebe> oh thats a nickname we were trying out. 
<ross> hey, yknow what nickname never caught on? the ross-a-tron!  
<joey>  hey! 
<phoebe> oh! heres joseph francis! 
<joey> oh-wha-ho! what are you middle naming me for?! i left you a note! 
<phoebe> so what?! that doesnt give you the right to ditch me! 
<joey> hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex! 
<ross> phoebe hes right, that is the rule. 
<phoebe> i dont accept this rule. when we make plans, i expect you to show up. okay, i cant just be a way to kill time til you meet someone better! yknow boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this  is for life! 
<joey> wow! im so sorry; i had no idea it would bother you this much. 
<phoebe> well, it does. 
<joey> okay, can i-can i make it up to you? huh? im sorry.  how about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! ill pay for myself! 
<phoebe> okay, you wore me down. 
<ross> hey joe, while youre over there how about another beer for the ross-a-tron? 
<joey> the rossis that back?!!  
< 
<rachel> hi! 
<chandler> another cheesecake came! they delivered it to the wrong address again! 
<rachel> so just bring it back downstairs, whats the problem? 
<chandler> i cant seem to say goodbye. 
<rachel> are you serious?! chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more? 
<chandler> well ive forgotten what it tastes like okay?! 
<rachel> it was cheesecake. it was fine. it had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling  wow! my whole mouth just filled with saliva! 
<chandler>  yknow what? forget it! we are just hungry! we have not had lunch! we are just light-headed! so let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake. 
<rachel> yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not tempted. 
<chandler> good idea. where do you want to go to lunch? 
<rachel> mommas little bakery, chicago, illinois.  
< 
<joey> awww! mel torme died. 
<monica> joey, that papers like a year old! 
<joey> aw! does that mean the sam goodys sale is over?! 
<ross>  hey. 
<joey> hey. 
<monica> hey. 
<ross> so i finally heard back from aunt sheryl and apparently it wasnt a mistake. ahh, theres-theres limited seating in the hall. 
<monica> limited seating?!  i am just one tiny person! 
<ross> well yeah, but she doesnt know that. i mean, the last time she saw you-you wouldve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling. 
<monica>  limited seating! oh, that is such a lame excuse! thats not the reason shes not inviting me! 
<ross> oh whats the big deal?! i wasnt even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. and-and yknow what? if it makes you feel any better, joan and i will just make an appearance and then, and then well-well leave early as a sign of protest. 
<monica> joan? 
<ross> yeah, joan tedeski my date. shes an assistant professor in the linguistics department. tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed! 
<monica> wait a minute, you got ross gellar and guest?! i wasnt invited and you got "and guest?!" 
<joey> uh-uh, excuse me, i do have to interrupt on rosss behalf. i-i think the rule applies here yknow, since she has a chance to get on broad back 
<ross>  not broad backed! 
<monica> wait a minute, yknow, youre bringing me! 
<ross> what? i cant cancel on joan! 
<monica> why not?! 
<ross> becdid you not hear me?! shes an assistant professor in the linguistics department, okay? theyre wild! why do you want to come anyway? 
<monica> because! shes my cousin. i mean, we grew up together! were family yknow? well thats important to me. 
<ross> okay, all right, ill take you. ill go call joan.

<rachel> no that could kill her. 
<chandler> well, we dont want that. 
<rachel> no, so were protecting her.

<rachel> yknow what tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.

<joey> face to face, yeah! 
<ross> okay, here i go. 
<joey> all right.  
<joey>  oh my how much do you weigh ross?! 
<ross> i prefer not to answer that right now, im still carrying a little holiday weight.  
<joey> yknow, when we talked about face to face, i dont think we thought it all the way through. 
<ross> so what do you want me to do? 
<joey> well, just shimmy down me and drop!  
<ross> hi. 
<joey> hi. 
<ross>  m-maybe i should hang and you can climb down me. 
<joey>  yeah? maybe we should talk about that for a little while! 
<ross> its still looks pretty far! 
<joey> its not that far! just drop! 
<ross> do not rush me!!  
<joey> ross, you should know that my pants are startin to come down and im not wearing any underwear!

<rachel> im sorry, rosita? as in 
<joey> as in rosita does not move. 
<rachel> joey, its just a chair! whats the big deal? 
<joey> the big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and its at the perfect angle so you dont get any glare coming off of stevie. 
<rachel> stevie the tv? 
<joey>  is there a problem? 
<rachel> no!  oh what does he know! come on rosita, us chichas got to stick together!  you bitch! opening credits

<ross> hey, yknow whats weird? after you guys get married, when you introduce me to people youre gonna have to say, "this is my brother-in-law ross." not, "my friend ross," "brother-in-law ross." thats weird isnt it? 
<chandler> couldnt i just say, "this is ross?" 
<ross>  sure, do whatever you want.  
<monica>  hey ross! so, i was checking out the uh, real estate section 
<ross> yeah? 
<monica> look at this.  
<ross> oh, it looks like mom and dads house. oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is oh my god!! 
<phoebe> what? what happened to the window in the attic?! 
<monica> i cant believe mom and dad are selling the house! 
<ross> i cant believe they-they didnt even tell us! 
<phoebe> i cant believe i still dont know what happened to the window in the attic!  
<ross>  uh, hello dad! monica and i just saw the house in the paper!  yes were surprised!  who did you leave a message with? 
<chandler>  sorry!  
< 
<rachel> joey, joey i am so sorry. 
<joey> i told you not to move it! rach, how would you feel if say, i wanted to move your mom, and you said dont, and i did it anyway and her head fell off? 
<rachel> okay, come onjoey, ill buy you a new one! all right? well go down to the store right now and well-well get you a new chair. 
<joey>  shes not even cold yet! 
<rachel> but dont you think rosita wouldve wanted you to move on? i mean yknow, she did always put your comfort first. 
<joey> thats true.  
<rachel>  okay? you ready? 
<joey> yeah, i  i dont want stevie to see her like this. 
< 
<ross> i cant believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. man, some-some strangers gonna be living in my room. 
<monica> well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, its time the velvet ropes came down. 
<ross> they kept your room for a while. 
<monica> oh please! dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after i moved out! i gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of victorias secret catalogues, not a gym! 
<ross> come on, you know they love you. 
<monica> as much as they love you? 
<ross> i was their first born! they thought she was barren! its not my fault. 
<phoebe>  hey. 
<ross> hey. 
<monica> hey! 
<phoebe> ugh, i hate this year! 
<ross> whats wrong with this year? 
<phoebe> well okay, its already february and ive only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world! 
<monica> that was me and ross. 
<phoebe> oh thats right! 
<ross> hey, yknow if you want to pick up some extra cash? some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing. 
<monica> oh thats a great idea. youre really good on the phone. 
<phoebe> yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job i had. yknow, i probably wouldnt have to say spank as much.  
<ross> what? 
<phoebe> oh yeah, like you never called! 
< 
<s> so basically this is very easy. you read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can. 
<phoebe> okay, i can do that! oh, by the way, i love my office. 
<s>  why dont we do a trial run. 
<phoebe> oh okay. umm, all right.  hi, this is phoebe from empire office supplies, can i speak to your supply manager please? 
<s> im the supply manager. 
<phoebe> umm, okay i would like to talk to you about your toner needs. 
<s> we dont need any toner. 
<phoebe> oh okay, well im sorry to bother you. bye-bye.  yeah youre right, this is easy. 
<s> okay, what was wrong with that call? 
<phoebe> oh well, all right um, no offense, but you were kind of rude. 
<s> theyre always going to tell you they dont need toner, but thats okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script. 
<phoebe> oh. 
<s> so, i think youre ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions? 
<phoebe> no.  oh wait yes! i do, i do have one question. what is toner? 
< 
<chandler> joey! joe!  full bag.  beers still cold. something terrible mustve happened here!  oh no-no-no-no-no-no!  stevie, i was never here!  
< 
<ross> dad? 
<s> im here! 
<ross>  hey! 
<s> hi. god, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work. 
<ross> dad, we-we cant believe youre selling the house. 
<s> well, its time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling. 
<ross>  lets grab our stuff and get the hell out of here. 
<s> im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore. 
<monica> oh, thats okay, i cant wait to see everything again! all of the memories 
<s> well, i dont know whats in the boxes down here, but i do know there are six or seven easy bake ovens in the attic. 
<monica> i used to love to play restaurant. 
<ross> yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater. 
<monica> hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!  
<s> so, i think your boxes are over here.  
<ross> wow! great!  wait, dad who-whos cigarettes are these? 
<s> i dont know. they-they must be your mothers, but please, please dont ask her. ill throw these away.  
<ross> cool! dad! my report cards! hey, check this out dad,  math, a. science, a. history, a. gym  oooh, my rock polisher! 
<s> oh look, look theres your old makeup kit! 
<ross> its a clown kit! clown kit! 
<s> well, the white seems to be untouched.  uh-oh. 
<ross> what? 
<s> yknow how the garage floods every spring? 
<ross> how are you ever going to sell this place? 
<s> i think i accidentally used monicas boxes to keep the water away from the porsche. 
<ross> oh no. dad! dad! what  oh god everythings ruined! dad, shes gonna be crushed! 
<s> you dont secretly smoke do you? 
<ross> no! 
<s> so its just your mother then.

<s> well i only have one thing to do today. (he looks at his board in his back. 
<phoebe> yeah! now, why do you want to kill yourself? 
<s> its just that i uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows i exist! 
<phoebe> chandler? 
<s> i-im sorry? 
<phoebe> no look, i-im sure that people know you exist! 
<s> oh yeah? i work in a cubicle surrounded by people. ive been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no ones even looked up from their desk. hang-hang on.  hey everybody! uh, im gonna kill myself!  ill get back to ya.  i got nothing. wait.  uh, hey marge!  ehh, nothing. nothing.

<rachel> come on joey, i just bought you a new chair! the most expensive one in the store! hey, yknow what i was thinking? we could name her francette. 
<joey> francette? what is she? a couch?  
<joey> poor thing. cut down in her prime. 
<rachel> joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. maybe we should actually move rosita out of here. yknow, start the healing process? 
<joey> well, i guess youre right. maybe, maybe ill take her down to the incinerator. its gonna be so sad, and kinda cool.  shes healed! 
<rachel> thats weird. 
<joey> no its not weird, its a miracle! 
<rachel> its not a miracle joey! im sure theres some explanation. 
<joey> oh there is! if you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen! 
<rachel> joey, i really dont 
<joey>  can you tell me how this happened? 
<rachel> well no. 
<joey> miracle! 
<rachel> no, yknow what? maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! or something! 
<joey> someone like an angel? 
<rachel> thats right joey, the chair angel came in and healed your chair.  
<joey>  get your non-believer ass outta my chair!  
< 
<s> well, shell understand right? its not like i did it on purpose. 
<ross> dad, that wont matter to her. look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all hers is-is, is growing new stuff! see, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her. 
<s> oh my god, does she really thinks that? 
<ross> well, can you blame her? 
<s> well i dont know, i-i suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! the doctor said your mother could 
<ross> dad, dad i dont want to hear about it. 
<s> really? 
<ross> well, not right now. okay look, monica came here for some memories and damnit, were gonna give her some! okay, grab grab some empty boxes. okay? well-well take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers well-well put em in there.

<monica>  really? wow! it looks like i had some trouble staying inside the lines. 
<ross> nu-uh!  
<monica>  oh, an old glove? 
<s> oh, yeah you loved that glove! you took it every place you went. you never went any place without that glove. 
<monica> wow! look at this!  i cant believe i even fit into this shirt! oh, this is yours.  
<ross> oh, i dont know how that got in there. 
<monica>  this isnt mine.  hey, this isnt, this isnt my stuff! ugh, ross!  these are your boxes! where are my boxes? 
<ross> umm, your boxes are umm 
<monica> what? 
<ross> dad? 
<s> well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes. im sorry. 
<monica> just mine? 
<s> im afraid so. 
<monica> so why-why wasnt rosss stuff ruined?  and if you say the words medical marvel im going to easy bake your head! 
<s> well, i used your boxes to divert water away from the porsche. 
<monica> so wait, rosss stuff is fine, but i have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!! 
<s> there was also leaves and guk and stuff. 
<monica> i cant believe this!  
<s>  screw it! im having one.  commercial break 
< 
<rachel> hey chandler! 
<chandler> hey! 
<rachel> how would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest? 
<chandler> yeah, id love to but ive tried that so many times they wont even let me in the store anymore. 
<rachel> well what if i told you you can do it in my apartment? 
<chandler>  are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? the chair that sit magazine called the chair of the year? 
<rachel> i just purchased the la-z-boy e-cliner 3000.  
<chandler> thats awesome! thats great! what made you do it?! 
<rachel> well, its a long story, but umm i broke joeys chair 
<chandler> whoa-whoa-whoa! you broke joeys chair? 
<rachel> yeah. 
<chandler> i thought i broke joeys chair! thats why i replaced it with mine! 
<rachel> ohhhhh. thats how it got fixed! 
<chandler> well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it? 
<rachel> noo!  angels. 
<chandler> im gettin my chair back!  
<rachel> what? wh-hey!  
<joey> well, it looks like it wasnt healed after all! yeah! so, i guess this chair is mine now!  
<chandler> joey you broke my chair!! 
<joey> your chair?! 
<rachel> yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs! 
<joey> so, there was no miracle?! 
<rachel> no joe, no miracle. 
<joey>  oh no this is devastating! my faith is shaken. im so glad i have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life. 
<rachel> uh-huh! nice try, but you dont get that chair anymore! all right? that is my chair now! you can sit on my lap!  no i take that back! 
<chandler> i think i should get the chair!  
<joey> how do you figure? 
<chandler> because you  broke a chair and you  broke a chair! the only one around here that hasnt broke a chair, is me! 
<rachel> no-no-no! this chairs not going anywhere. 
<chandler> well, wheres the logic in that?! 
<rachel> the logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half! 
<chandler> so joey breaks my chair and i get nothing!  
<joey> thats right! 
<chandler> what are you guys? like a gang or something?!  
<joey> yeah! we are!  
<rachel> were the cobras!

<s>  look, um i really appreciate your coming down 
<phoebe> no-no i cant! i cant let you do it! 
<s> why?! 
<phoebe> because it was fate that made me call you today! 
<s> i thought it was toner. 
<phoebe> no! think about it okay? this isnt even my regular job! okay? and my first day on the job, youre my first call! and-and somebody else mightve hung up on you, but i wouldnt do that because i know about this stuff. my mom killed herself. 
<s> really?! 
<phoebe> yes. 
<s> how? 
<phoebe> im not gonna give you tips! look dont you see that this-this this all came together so that i could stop you from doing this. 
<s> couldnt it just be a coincidence? 
<phoebe> no, its fate! 
<s> it doesnt really seem like enough to be fate. 
<phoebe> oh. well umm, okay heres a weird thing. my mother was also a supply manager. 
<s> im actually the office manager. 
<phoebe> oh my god! so was she! and! get this, okay? your-your name is earl, right? her name was pearl, p-earl. 
<s> well, was there anything else?! 
<phoebe> sure!  umm, where are you from? 
<s> philadelphia.

<s>  really? 
<phoebe> well, yknow im wearing layers and its warm. 
<s> yeah-yeah. 
<phoebe> but ifno look, okay. these jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! and that says a lot! 
<s>  did you hear that?! i dont need you guys to care about me! because the universe cares! the whole universe!  i really wished theyd care just a little bit though.

<s> yeah.

<ross> all right. i think it was a mouse.  
<s>  how are you honey? 
<monica> how do you think i am?! youve wrecked all my childhood memories. you love ross more than me. and i just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!  
<s> sweetheart, we love you just as much as ross! now, im sorry about everything that happened and id probably never be able to make it up to you, but heres a start.  
<monica>  whats this? 
<s> its the key to my porsche. well, the key to your porsche. 
<monica>  what?! 
<ross>  what?!!! 
<s> ive been thinking about getting rid of it. i was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. your mothers right, i do look like an ass. 
<monica> wait, youre giving me your porsche, youre kidding me right?! 
<ross> well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! i mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a porsche?!

<s> come on, lets have some fun. huh?  what do you want to do today? 
<rachel> nothing. i dont want to do anything. 
<monica> well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like ross. 
<ross> hey! that was a practical purchase! i needed that car for transportation! okay? i-i have a child! one of the better british sports cars ever made. of course, better is a relative term. which reminds me of a joke. why dont the british make computers? because they couldnt figure out how to make them leak oil. anyway, the gang is all staring at his new purchase.] 
<ross> how hot do i look in this, huh?! 
<chandler> ross, a sports car? wouldnt it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there? 
<ross> thats not what this is about okay? i-i am a sports car enthusiast. i have always been into cars. 
<joey> hey, whats the horsepower on this thing? 
<ross>  i dont know, but-but look how shiny!

<ross> hop in.  get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.  anyway, this being new york he is parallel parked on a street with the car in front of him only inches ahead of his bumper, likewise with the car behind him. hes completely boxed in and cant move more than two inches. he tries to get out several times by bumping the bumpers of both cars to no avail.)

<chandler> monicas a little drunk. 
<phoebe> yay! i love drunk monica! 
<monica> awwwww  
<chandler>  go change!  she doesnt want her parents to know shes drunk. 
<phoebe> ohh! all right! all right. heres what well do, ill get twice as drunk as monica and then no one will even notice her.  
<rachel> whats-whats going on? phils really pissed! 
<chandler> monicas wasted. 
<ross> maybe that will liven up this party. 
<chandler>  okay, will you just go help her change please! 
<rachel> okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for joey. 
<joey> yep.  
< 
<s>  this ones from me. 
<rachel> ahh! 
<s> it wasnt on your list, but hopefully youll think its really fun. 
<rachel>  a scooter!  
<ross>  stick to the list. always stick to the list. 
<rachel> no! no-no, i love it. thank you.  
<chandler> okay, open ours next. open ours next! 
<rachel> okay. 
<joey> now that youre a couple, we dont get two presents from you guys? 
<chandler> for my last birthday you gave me a hug!  okay, read the card! read the card! 
<rachel> okay.  happy birthday grandma! its better to be over the hill  then buried under it.  all our love monica and chandler.  thats funny, yeah! 
<chandler> no-no-no-no! that was the joke! 
<rachel>  no, i know! i get it! its funny! 
<chandler> no, because youre not a grandmother! 
<rachel> no i know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and i dont have any of those things. thats why its so funny.  
<monica> all you had to do was buy the card! 
< 
<ross> hey! look whos back! its the birthday girl! hows the birthday girl feeling? 
<rachel> well, i feel fine, but i think youre bumming out the rest of the kids. 
<ross> what?  
<rachel> okay! yknow what? i realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. all i really needed was a plan. see i wanna have three kids 
<phoebe> oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother. 
<rachel> as i was saying i should probably have the first of the three kids by the time im 35 which gives me five years. i love this plan! i wanna marry this plan! 
<phoebe> if you could do that, id marry the hippity-hop. 
<rachel> so, if i wanna have my kid when im 35, i dont have to get pregnant until im 34. which gives prada four years to start making maternity clothes! oh wait, but i do want to be married for a year before i get pregnant 
<monica> really! that long?!  look all you want, its happening! 
<rachel> no, so i dont have to get married until im 33! thats three years, thats three whole yearsoh, wait a minute though. ill need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and id like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged which means i need to meet the guy by the time im thirty. 
<ross> which is fine! because you just turnedtwenty-eight! 
<rachel> no! ross, no! it is not fine! eh-eh-according to my plan i should already be with the guy i wanna marry!  
<joey> will you quit hoggin it! commercial break 
< 
<rachel>  im telling you its like watching bambi learn how to walk. 
<ross>  youre drunk! mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! maybe im a little drunk.  
<chandler>  oh thats great! right there! can we get some of that over here please?  there we go. 
<joey>  hey! are those crab cakes?  did i not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready? 
<chandler>  how are you feeling? 
<monica> you are so handsome! i wanna make love to you right here, right now!  
<ross> i really wish that you wouldnt. 
<chandler>  now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? then we can put you in bed, okay? just smile and dont talk to anyone. 
<phoebe>  speech! speech! lets hear from the birthday girl! huh? 
<chandler> pheebs!! 
<phoebe> dont you see? everyones looking at me! the plans working! i didnt even have to take off my top yet! 
<s> speech! come on monica! 
<ross> come on! 
<s> come on! speech!  
<s>  hey chandler, you cant keep your hands off her for one second! 
<s> oh-ho, i think its nice. 
<chandler> i think its necessary.  
<monica> i-i-i wanna thank you all for coming. my family and my friends 
<phoebe>  wooo!! hoo!! 
<monica> i really like to say that im-um  yknow what id really like to say? im drunk!!  thats right mom and dad your little harmonica is hammered!!  and guess what! ive been drunk before! and ive smoked a cigarette! and i got a box of ding-dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! its all okay. its okay because i turned thirty today. and, and i can do anything i want! because i am a grown up.  
<phoebe>  okay quick, help me get this off!  
<joey> yeah!!  
< 
<phoebe> i lost a whole year! i cant believe it! this is so unfair! 
<joey> oh, i dont know pheebs. itll be okay. 
<phoebe> will it? will it?! i mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31? 
<joey> thats not gonna happen. no.  because we have a new deal! 
<phoebe> plus, it totally ruined my schedule! i i havent done any of the things i wanted to do by the time i was 31!

<rachel>  ohh 
<ross> whats the matter? you okay? 
<rachel> yeah, its just yknow 
<chandler>  monica said wedding. 
<monica> uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony. 
<rachel> oh! i would love to read a poem. 
<chandler> do you think you could get through a poem? 
<rachel>  itll be a short one. 
<monica> okay, so ross will be doing the reading. 
<rachel> ohhh 
<ross> okay. yeah, i guess, i guess i could do that too. 
<chandler> too? 
<ross> yeah, i kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys. 
<monica> do you mind telling us what it is? 
<ross> sorry, im kinda keeping this one on the q.t. 
<chandler> well, whatever it is, i hope it involves winking.  
<joey>  hey! 
<s> hey! 
<joey> so i just talked to one of the dool writers today, and 
<monica> what is dool? 
<joey> days of our lives. anyway, youre not gonna believe it! my character is coming out of his coma!! 
<s> oh!! 
<chandler> thats great! 
<joey> and-and-and not only that, im gettin a new brain!! 
<chandler> so great things are happening at work and in your personal life! 
<rachel> wait, what do you mean youre getting a new brain? 
<joey> oh well, theyre killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body. 
<ross> what? a brain transplant?! 
<joey>  yes, its a highly controversial procedure. 
<ross> its ridiculous! 
<joey> well, i think its ridiculous that you havent had sex in three and a half months. 
<ross>  its winter, they are fewer people on the street.  
<monica> who are they killing off? 
<joey> uh cecilia monroe, she plays jessica lockhart. 
<monica> shes my favorite character on dool. 
<joey> nice. 
<rachel> she is so good at throwing drinks in peoples faces, i mean i dont think ive ever seen her finish a beverage. 
<monica> and the way she slaps all the time! 
<rachel> oh! 
<monica> wouldnt you love to do it just once?!  
<chandler> dont do it. 
<rachel> cecilia monroe man, what a great actress. 
<joey> oh, tell me about it. and shes been on the show forever, its gonna be really hard to fill her shoes. 
<ross> yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her? 
<joey> yes, but in drake ramorays body.  why is this so hard for you to get? i thought you were a scientist! opening credits 
< 
<phoebe>  rach, so, that guy there. straight or gay? 
<rachel>  well, i'd have to say gay. 
<phoebe> yeah? why? 
<rachel> well mainly because he's kissing that other guy. 
<phoebe> oh no not that guy there. that guy right there.  
<rachel> oh yeah he's too cute to be straight. 
<phoebe>  ohh knockers will help us figure it out.  
<rachel> all right, straight, and not subtle.  
<phoebe> ohh, he left his cell phone. 
<rachel> oh, well, we can hand it to gunther and he'll put it in lost and found. 
<phoebe> or we could use it to call china. see how those guys are doing. 
<rachel> what if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and i answer and we start talking and we fall in love. i mean wouldn't that be a great story? kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age. 
<phoebe> yeah that does sound great. i'm going to get the phone.  
<rachel> what? wait! why why do you get the story? 
<phoebe> i don't know. i haven't been out on a date in so long. 
<rachel> phoebe, you had a date three days ago. 
<phoebe> that wasnt a date! that was, that was just friends getting together  having sex. 
<rachel> okay. okay, see? i get the phone. 
<phoebe> no way! no way! you just broke with tag a week ago. 
<rachel> yeah!  and until now, i didnt think id love again. 
<phoebe> nice try. 
<rachel> oh hey-hey wait! how do we fairly decide who gets the phone? 
<phoebe> i dont know.  
<rachel> well umm, maybe we could uhh  ah-ha! too slow!!  
<phoebe> ah-ha! too cocky! 
< 
<s> im going to keep dating him mother, and theres nothing you can do about it! 
<s> what are you going to do? kill him? like you did with charles?! 
<s> well, at least im not a murderer!  to her other shoulder so that shes the only one in the picture.) 
<s> cut!  
<joey> that was a great scene! and-and-and that slap looks so real! how do you do that? 
<s> oh, just years of experience. 
<s>  can i get some ice here?! 
<joey> oh anyway, i just wanted to say how wonderful i think you are. 
<s> youre not the fan whos dying are you? 
<joey> say what? 
<s> im supposed to meet and hug a fan who's dying, but thats not supposed to be until  later! 
<joey> no. no, im joey tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. i-im the guy in the coma! 
<s> oh that was a real person?! 
<joey> an-an-anyway i-i just wanted to say that since im getting your brain when you leave the show, i was wondering if there was any tips you can give me 
<s> i-i-im leaving the show? 
<joey>  i dont know. why? did you hear something? 
<s> who told you that? 
<joey> oh uh, one of the writers. 
<s> which one? was it bald or was it tall? 
<joey> umm 
<s> yknow what? it doesnt matter! because it is not true! 
<joey> okay. 
<s> and if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that ive been playing for 20 yearsill give you a tip!  
<joey> ms. monroe  oh there you go.  
< 
<rachel> no phoebe! you cannot get the phone that way; thats not fair! okay look, i have an idea. why dont we, why dont we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. and then whoever does gets the phone. 
<phoebe> or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone. 
<rachel> i dont think so. 
<phoebe>  fine all right, but id bet youd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet. 
<rachel>  all right, first name on the speed dial is mom. 
<phoebe> ohh, i lost my mom to suicide. 
<rachel> okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin. 
<phoebe> did i use that already today? im sorry. 
<rachel> yes okay.  well now see this isnt telling us anything.  joe. carlos. peter. ooh! peter luger! t hats a steak house! 
<phoebe> okay, a meat eater. fine, thats one for you. 
<rachel>  oh, i win! hes got barneys on his speed dial. 
<phoebe> so you dont know thats barneys the store! that can be yknow his friends house, or a bar. who has barneys the store on their speed dial? 
<rachel>  his new girlfriend! 
< 
<monica> what is that? 
<chandler> i think its the dying cat parade. 
<monica> it sounds like its coming from across the street. 
<chandler>  oh my god! 
<monica> what? 
<chandler> yknow that thing that ross was gonna do at our wedding?! he was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "youre half scottish right?" 
<monica> nooo!! 
<chandler> yes!!  commercial break 
< 
<monica> no, there is no way! it can not be ross!  unbelievable! why is your family scottish?! 
<chandler> why is your family ross?! 
<monica> he cannot play at our wedding! i mean everyone will leave! i mean come on, that is just noise! its not even a song! 
<chandler> if you listen very carefully, i think its celebration by cool and the gang. 
< 
<rachel> hi pheebs! 
<phoebe> hi! 
<rachel> how are ya? 
<phoebe> good. 
<rachel> umm pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that i was going to keep the uh, the cute guys cell phone? 
<phoebe> yeah. 
<rachel> and remember how i said i was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang i could just pick it up? 
<phoebe> yeah! 
<rachel> and do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?! 
<phoebe> ooh, now you lost me. 
<rachel> you stole the phone!

<chandler> thats not really important right now. what is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just dont feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding. 
<ross> why not? 
<chandler> because we hate them. 
<ross> come on thats not fair! i mean you havent even heard me play! 
<chandler> we have heard you play. 
<ross> no, youve heard my practice. okay? just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. and im not going to tell you what song im gonna play either. but uh, lets just say when its over ill bet there will be a wee bit o celebration.

<s> so, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. so, when jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room.  you try. 
<joey> okay!  all right! 
<s> no, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! hes not finding it out for the first time! so, try it again. 
<joey> okay. okay.  
<s> right. hes not angry at the room either. try it again, he owns it! he owns the room. it is his. he owns, owns, owns, owns the room! he owns it!!  all right, its a little weird, but its getting better.  oh well, im gonna miss this woman so much. i dont know what im going to do! i mean, its been 20 years of my life. 
<joey> oh wellhey-hey! maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. yknow? itll-itll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. youre so talented. 
<s> i am. i am, but i dont know, you know. an actor of a certain age is not that easy. 
<joey> hey thats not true! look at uh, look at angela lansbangelina jolie! 
<s> i probably shouldve just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but yknow i just got so comfy here! and ohh, i turned down some amazing work! 
<joey> like-like what? 
<s> well, lets just say if i left 15 years ago, the landscape of mexican cinema would be very different today! 
<joey>  wow!

<joey> oh hey come on, dont-dont-dont do this! umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? now when i watch you do a scene, im thinking, "boy, she-she is a great actress!"  uh but-but, i am also thinking, "she is hot!" 
<s>  you think im hot? 
<joey> you own the room.  we should probably get-get uh 
<s> oh yeah-yeah, we should get the  so when jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the mans face.  
<joey> yeah-yeah, i noticed that! is that cause shes so passionate? 
<s> no! its because that way the camera only sees her!  do you wanna try it? 
<joey> yeah! okay.

<chandler> yeah! 
<phoebe>  with what? 
<monica> well, were trying to find someone to perform our wedding and theyre all either boring or annoying or yknow, cant stop staring at the ladies.

<rachel> oh, youre one of those. but yknow what? i have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other. 
<s> really? like how? 
<rachel> well yknow, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, wed jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so theyd put salt on their cereal.

<rachel> yeah? you like that one? 
<s> yeah, youre funny. 
<rachel> im funny? oh thank god! well hey, ive got a ton of these! umm, oh heredo you want a good one? heres a good one. umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. right?  and then you say to person, i bet you cant roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. and then when they do it, theyre left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.

<monica> how about receiving? 
<joey> yes!

<monica> i know, i just thought it would be fun. 
<chandler> how drunk are you?

<chandler>  thats the perfect amount! 
<monica> okay!  
<monica>  yknow whats weird? 
<chandler> what? 
<monica> this doesnt feel weird!

<chandler> count of three? 
<monica> one! 
<chandler> two! 
<monica> two! out, then come back up with silly grins on their faces.)

<monica> eh, we werent that close anyway! 
<chandler> eh!  
<chandler> joey! joey! joey! j-j-joey-joey-j-joey!

<chandler> no i-i-im fine. 
<joey> all right, here you go buddy.  go nuts.   
<joey> thats what that was?! cause that other thing? i thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me. 
<monica> okay, can we change the topic? because its really doing nothing for me. 
<joey> oh  can you imagine if i hadnt left you that last one? you two mightve never gotten together. ooh-ooh! could you imagine if i sent that hooker up to the room like i was gonna?! its like it was in the stars! 
<phoebe> yeah, its totally meant to be.  tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night. 
<monica> what?! 
<chandler> what? 
<phoebe>  what?! 
<chandler> who did you originally want to hook up with? 
<monica> okay, fine but please dont be upset! okay? i was really depressed okay? and really drunk! i just wanted something stupid and meaningless. i just wanted just sex. so, when i went to your room that night i was actually looking for joey.  
<joey> yeah baby!  no baby! commercial break 
< 
<chandler>  so you came to the room looking for joey? did you ever in-intend on telling me about this? 
<monica> no, because it-it didnt seem important. 
<chandler> oh, its not important? its not important?! if it wasnt for a bridesmaid youd be marrying him  not me! 
<monica> noo!! the point is that is was you that was there that night! it is you that i am marrying! it is you that i fell in love with! 
<joey> and it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv 
<chandler> i dont believe it. the most romantic night of my life and im runner up. 
<monica> chandler, please! do you know how unbelievably glad i am that joey was not there that night?! 
<joey> hey!  now im a man of the cloth, but i still have feelings! 
<chandler>  look there is no way youre doing this wedding now. okay?

<chandler> bye!  commercial break 
< 
<ross> well obviously only one of us can keep dating her. 
<joey> obviously! so, how do we decide? 
<ross> well now lets-lets look at this objectively, i think i should date her 
<joey>  uh-huh. uh-huh. or, or im the one who dates her. 
<ross> thats interesting, but check this out. i date her 
<joey> yeah-yeah i like that but just to go in another direction

<ross> no joey! look why dont, why dont we just let her decide? okay? hey-hey, well each go out with her one more time. and-and well see who she likes best. 
<joey>  that sounds fair. 
<ross> maybe ill take her to that new french restaurant down the street 
<joey> ah yeahwait a second now! look were gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. i dont have the money to take her to a fancy place like that. 
<ross> well sorry, thats what i do on dates. 
<joey> all right, well i guess ill just have to do what i do on dates. 
<ross> so lets decide on the spending limit 
<joey> yeah. uh,  a slice  six dollars? 
<ross> i was thinking more like a hundred. 
<joey> okay. can i borrow 94 dollars? 
< 
<monica> oh

<monica> phoebe, hes gotta be in the room for that to work. 
<chandler>  what are you guys talking about? 
<monica> well umm, we were just talking about the yknow, the swing kings and just wondering whether yknow, they were the right way to go. 
<rachel> yeah, i went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. and now im not saying that theres any connection here yknow, but they did tell me thats why they got divorced. 
<chandler> but i love swing music! 
<phoebe> yeah but the swing kings? yknow they suck so much that people actually die at their concertsthey just stop living. 
<chandler> look all i know is when monica and i went to see them, we had fun! and theres another reason too. 
<rachel> well, what is the other reason? 
<chandler> i dont want to say. 
<rachel> well you have to because maybe its stupid. 
<chandler> well its just while monica and i were dancing to them it was the first time i knew that you were the woman i wanted to dance all my dances with. 
<monica> oh crap! 
< 
<ross> so they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes. 
<s> oh great! 
<ross> yeah.

<joey>  kristen? 
<s> joey! 
<joey> hi! 
<s> hi! what are you doing here? 
<joey> oh i like this place. and technically, technically im not breaking any rules so i 
<s> well uh, ross? this is joey. joey? ross. 
<joey> hi! 
<ross> hi.  its nice to meet you. i used to have a friend named joey. i dont anymore.

<s> well joey doesnt like to talk about it but, hes one of the stars of days of our lives. 
<ross> thats right! thats right, dont you play a woman? 
<joey> a woman in a mans body. 
<ross> much better. 
<joey> so yknow ross its funny cause, you look familiar to me too. have you ever been married? 
<ross> well yes, yes i have. in fact umm, just the other day kristen and i were talking about how ive been married and how i have a son. 
<s> yeah, little eric. 
<ross> thats right! wait no, ben. 
<joey> so youve just married the one time then? 
<ross> well umm 
<s> youve been married twice? 
<ross> yes. and another time after that. boy im getting hungry! hey joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you ate some of her food? 
<s> you said the waiter ate my crab cake. 
<joey>  yeah. so uh ross, well nowwhy did that first marriage breakup? was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian? 
<s> do you two know each other? 
<joey> no. it just seems like ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.  
<ross> wait a minute! were you on a poster for gonorrhea? 
<joey> have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?! 
<ross> hey you leave marcel out of this!

<monica> okay, stop it phoebe, youre getting me all tingly. 
<phoebe>  all i could think of was yknow, "is he gonna kiss me? is he gonna kiss me?"

<monica> okay-okay, i got it. i got it.

<monica> oh, i havent had that feeling since i first started going out with chandler. wow, im never gonna have that feeling again, am i? 
<phoebe> you sound like a guy. 
<monica> no, a guy would be saying, "im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." oh my god! im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! ive been so busy planning the wedding that i forgot about all the things that id be giving up! i mean, i im never gonna have a first kiss again.

< 
<monica> hey! what did you decide to do about the movie? 
<joey> i dont know! its not like its porn! this is a serious, legitimate movie. yknow? and the nudity is really important to the story. 
<monica> thats what you say about porn. 
<joey> youre right. maybe i shouldnt even go on the call back. 
<monica> no! no you should! a lot of major actors do nude scenes! i mean, the chance to star in a movie? come on! 
<joey> well thats true. and i am only naked in one scene. plus it sounds really great. my characters catholic and he falls in love with this jewish girl. who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. so we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. its really sweet and-and tender. 
<monica> plus, everyones gonna see your thing.  
< 
<phoebe> well, when can we have this shower? 
<rachel> she has got so much going on we-we have only two options. we have friday 
<phoebe> well thats only two days away. what is the other option? 
<rachel> yesterday!

<rachel>  okay. im sorry. youre right, youre right. 
<phoebe>  just calm down woman! 
<rachel> phoebe, i already, i already did. 
<phoebe> oh okay. all right, then i need to calm down a little. 
<rachel> okay. okay.  i think we can do this if we just get organized. all right? we have two days to plan this party. we just need to make fast decisions! okay? all right, where are we gonna have it? 
<phoebe> uh, here. what time? 
<rachel> 4 oclock. food? 
<phoebe> finger sandwiches and tea. 
<rachel> ooh great! very monica.

<rachel> ah you went one too far. uh, flowers or balloons? 
<phoebe> both! 
<rachel> were paying for this yknow. 
<phoebe> neither. 
<rachel> okay. umm, what should we do for the theme? 
<phoebe> lusts of the flesh. 
<rachel>  what? 
<phoebe> i dont know.  a cowboy theme? 
< 
<chandler> hey! 
<monica> hey! 
<chandler> yknow im-im really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding. 
<monica> oh boy, me too! 
<chandler> yknow i was thinking if we had a a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours 
<monica> yeah? 
<chandler> technically we could have sex again. what do you think, bossy and domineering?! 
<monica> the wedding is off, sloppy and immature! 
<chandler> thats me! come on! 
<monica> okay.  but wait, we cant. my cousin cassie is in the guest room, were supposed to have lunch. 
<chandler> well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill. 
<monica> shrill?! the wedding is back on!  
<s> i thought i heard voices. you must be chandler. 
<chandler>  hi! nice to meet you! 
<s> nice to meet you too. 
<monica> so, are you ready to go? 
<s> yeah.  
<monica>  chandler! 
<chandler> ill be right with you. 
< 
<monica>  cassie needs to stay at your place. 
<ross> whatwhy? 
<monica> because purvy perverson over here cant stop staring at her. 
<ross> what?! chandler, shes our cousin! 
<chandler> i was not staring at her. okay? i was just listening intently. its called being a good conversationalist. watch.  say something. 
<monica> you were staring about eight inches south of there. 
<ross> fine, she can stay at my place. by the way, what-what does cassie even look like now. 
<monica> she looks exactly like aunt marilyn. 
<chandler> umm, so this aunt marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding? 
<monica> wafer thin ice! 
< 
<joey> hey, im back! 
<joey> uh so, will-will i be reading the same scene again? come down here today. 
<joey> oh great! yknow i wouldve been perfect for this part, but whatever! yknow, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! good day!  director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it. 
<joey> and scene! huh? wasnt that fun? we did a little improv there. yeah! okay! so you-you-you-you were saying? part and wants to meet you tomorrow. 
<joey> wow! sure! thats great! 
<joey> yeah! yeah sure, just so long as its handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold. its really important to the_director that everything in this movie is authentic. yeah, and so in your love scene with sarah she talks about how shes never seen a naked man who wasnt jewish. so  
<joey> so what? that part be authentically, anatomically not jewish. do you know what im saying? 
<joey> yes! 
<joey> no. what? be 
<joey> barmitsvahed?  
< 
<monica> so to get this part you cant be? 
<joey> nope. 
<monica> but you are? 
<joey> yep. 
<monica> but you told them you werent? 
<joey> thats right. 
<monica> wow! wow! and its definitely all gone? theres nothing there to work with?  what were you thinking? 
<joey> i dont know! i really want this part! and they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell em you can! and just figure out how to do it later. 
<monica> joey! this is not like learning to ride a horse! this is like learning to grow a turtleneck! 
<joey> i kn-i know! i know! okay? and apparently tomorrow when i go in to meet the_director i have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like. 
<monica> oh my god, what are you gonna do?! 
<joey> i just have to call my agent and tell her i cant do the part.  
<monica> unless! 
<joey> unless what? 
<monica> well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion. 
<joey> like what? 
<monica> well im not sure yet, but umm, off the top of my head im thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat. 
< 
<phoebe> hey! ive got a great idea for party favors for the shower. okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyones names in them and inside is everyones individual birth stone. 
<rachel> okay. okay. all right, you take care of that. and meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still dont have a guest list. 
<phoebe> okay. okay! well okay, who do we know thats coming? me. are you?

<monica> i guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!  
<rachel>  we have to get her a present?! 
<phoebe> okay but look! look at what i got! its her address book!  we have a guest list!

<joey> thank god! 
<monica>  now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable. 
<joey> ah. 
<monica> okay?  over here we have pink suede, which is nice. but umm, if it gets wet then you know its gonna shrink. 
<joey> well maybe we just take that one away.  
<monica> i also, did a little something in fur. but umm, thats really just for me.  okay. so, why dont you go into your room and try these on and well seeget a better idea of whats gonna work.

<phoebe> what is this? whats going on? 
<joey> oh good! can i tell her?! can i tell her?! 
<rachel> well, do you want to hear what actually happened or joeys lewd version? 
<phoebe> joeys! 
<joey> okay 
<rachel> hey, come on! i had this friend from college and i made the stupid mistake of telling joey that one time she and i yknow kissed a little bit. 
<phoebe>  yeah, im sure that happened. 
<rachel> it-it did! 
<phoebe> sure! 
<joey> hey.  it happened! 
<rachel> yeah, it was senior year in college. it was after the sigma chi luau and melissa and i got very drunk! and we ended up kissing! for several minutes! 
<phoebe>  which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek. 
<joey> why are you taking this away from me? 
<rachel> yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?! 
<phoebe> okay! i justi didnt know that you are a lesbian.  
<rachel> im not saying that im a lesbian! im just saying that this happened! 
<phoebe> okay, it just seems pretty wild and youre soyknow so vanilla. 
<rachel>  vanilla?! 
<phoebe> yeah. 
<rachel> im not vanilla! ive done lots of crazy things! i mean i got-i got drunk and married in vegas! 
<phoebe> to ross.

<phoebe> okay! all right! yeah! cause i just cant picture it. 
<joey> oh-ho, you should get inside my head. 
< 
<ross> hey! guess what i got for your wedding!  
<chandler> a freakish thin date with a hanger for her head? 
<ross> no. rachel hooked me up with a tux! but not just any tux, batmans tux! 
<chandler> what? 
<ross> thats right! made expressly for val kilmer and worn by him in the hit film that batman film he was in. 
<chandler> you cant wear that! im wearing the famous tux! james bonds tux! 
<ross> so? 
<chandler> soif you wear that youll make mine less special. 
<ross> well, you need something to make this day special? hello! you-you-you have the most special thing of all! you are marrying the woman you love.  
<chandler> please, dont take away my cool thing. please?! pretty please?! 
<ross> pretty please? not very uh, 007. 
<chandler> look, its my wedding day okay? if you were getting married i would never do anything to upset you. 
<ross> when i got married you slept with my sister.

<joey> yeah, theyre not coming. 
<monica>  what?! 
<joey> somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. they feel a little unwanted. 
<monica> oh thats too bad. its true, but too bad. 
<joey> look mon, if you could just call my mom 
<monica> oh joey! 
<joey> come on! look just-just telllet her know that you really want them to be there. lets not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years. 
<monica> no she hasnt. 
<joey> is it her fault that some of them didnt make it to you? 
<monica> well, what am i going to say? 
<joey> i dont know. just uh, just tell em it was a mix-up with the invitations, orno-no-no! blame it on the post office. they hate the post office. and the irish! but i dont think you can blame it on them, so  
<monica>  hello?  yeah, hi! mrs. tribbiani?  hi, this is monica geller.  yeah im just calling to say that chandler and i uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent werent delivered. umm, i guess there was some screw up at the damn post office!  t-tell me about it!  yeah, yeah, the us post office? no, more like us lost office!  what, are they irish?!

<phoebe> yeah, except your breasts look kinda small.  
<monica> those are my eyes! those are my breasts.  
<phoebe> oh! yeah!

<chandler> yeah, im not sure i can do that.  
<ross> ...everyone, this is chandler! 
<chandler>  okay.  
<rachel> okay. okay. okay. umm, maybe you can start with, "chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew i wanted more."  
<chandler> all right, theres a nuclear holocaust, im the last man on earth. would you go out with me? 
<monica> ennnh.  
<monica> ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?! 
<phoebe> well maybe you dont talk about your feelings back then. maybe you just say something about, yknow, all the things that hes taught you. like  or all the things you taught him.  
<monica> now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones.  you got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven! 
<chandler>  there are seven?!  thats one? 
<monica> its kind of an important one! 
<chandler> oh, yknow-yknow what, i was looking at it upside down. 
<rachel> well, yknow, sometimes that helps.  
<monica> all right. umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4,  2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 7.. 7 7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7 !

<chandler> all right. i'll tell you what. when we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and i get together and have one? 
<monica> why won't i be married when i'm 40? 
<chandler> oh, no, no. i just meant hypothetically. 
<monica> ok, hypothetically, why won't i be married when i'm 40? 
<chandler> no, no, no. 
<monica> what is it? is there something fundamentally unmarriageable about me? 
<chandler>  uh, uh. 
<monica> well? 
<chandler> dear god! this parachute is a knapsack!   
<ross>  im getting married today!! ahh, whoo-hoo!! 
<monica>  do you think he knew i was here?   
<chandler> nice try. 
<monica> wait, wait, wait!  
<chandler> look, monica 
<monica> look!  
<chandler> this is not going to work. 
<monica> i bet this will work!  
<chandler> you are so great! i love you!  
<monica> what? 
<chandler> nothing! i said, i said "you're so great" and then i just, i just stopped talking!

<monica> you love me! 
<chandler> no i don't! stop it! stop it! stop it! stop it!   
<chandler>  yknow i was thinking, what if i uh, unpack here? 
<monica> then all your stuff would be here. 
<chandler> well, what if all my stuff was here? 
<monica> then youd be going back and forth all the time, i mean it doesnt make any sense. 
<chandler> okay. what if we lived together and you understand what im saying?   
<monica> you wanted it to be a surprise.  
<chandler> oh my god.  
<monica> chandler in all my life i never thought i would be so lucky.  as to fall in love with my best my best theres a reason why girls dont do this! 
<chandler> okay!  okay! okay! i'll do it!  oh god, i thought  wait a minute, i-i can do this.  i thought that it mattered what i said or where i said it. then i realized the only thing that matters is that you,  you make me happier than i ever thought i could be.  and if youll let me, i will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.  monica, will you marry me?

<joey> hey! 
<ross> hey! 
<rachel> hey! 
<phoebe> hey! 
<rachel> hey, what have you guys been up to? 
<ross> oh, we were helping chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because joey kept making inappropriate suggestions. 
<joey> how is "monica, i love your sweet ass," inappropriate? 
<ross> hows monica coming along with her vows? 
<phoebe> well lets just say its.. shes lucky she has a sweet ass, cause shes not so good at the writing. 
<ross> i cant believe that in four weeks theyre gonnta be married! 
<phoebe> well lets just hope it works. yknow, nine out of ten marriages end in divorce? 
<ross> phoebe thats not true. 
<phoebe> yeah, youre right. hows the mrs.? 
<rachel> i cant believe theyve been together for three years. 
<joey>  has it been that long?! 
<ross> believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.   
<joey> hey, it's me! i'm comin' in!  
<chandler> i've had a very long, hard day. 
<joey> ahh, i'm gonna go get some chicken. want some?

<joey> i know! i mean its not like we werent cool about it.  
<joey>  you?!  and-and you?! 
<monica> yes, but you cannot tell anyone! no one knows! 
<joey> how?! when?! 
<chandler> it happened in london. 
<joey> in london!!! 
<chandler> the reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it. 
<joey> but it is a big deal!! i have to tell someone!  
<chandler> no-no-no-no-no! you can't! 
<monica> please? please?! we just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? just promise you won't tell.  
<joey> all right! man, this is unbelievable!  
<monica>  i can't wait to be with you!  i'll just tell rachel i'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours. 
<chandler>  laundry. huh. is that my new nickname?

<phoebe> okay, so now they know that you know, and they don't know that rachel knows? 
<joey> yes, but y'know what? it doesn't matter who knows what. now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over! 
<phoebe> or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own  
<rachel> all right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie. 
<monica> bye! 
<s> bye! 
<phoebe> bye chandler!  i miss you already.

<rachel> ugh, i knew it! oh i cannot believe those two! 
<phoebe> god, they thought they can mess with us! they're trying to mess with us?! they don't know that we know they know we know!  joey, you can't say anything! 
<joey> i couldn't even if i wanted to.  
<chandler> listen, this is totally getting out of hand! okay? she wants me to put lotion on her!

<phoebe> he's not backing down. he went to get lotion. 
<joey>  oh man! aren't you guys done yet?!

<rachel> well, things change. 
<joey> i dont want them to move to a volvo dealership! 
<ross> itll be okay joe. 
<joey> im sorry, i just i like things the way they are.

<ross> dude! how-how did you write this? 
<chandler> i stole monicas and changed the name. 
<ross> you cant do that! 
<joey> if he goes first he can! 
< 
<ross> hey! 
<monica> hey! 
<ross> hey uh mon, i saw the porsche parked out front, can i get the keys? thought id take that bad boy out for a little spin. 
<rachel> wait a minute!  you let ross drive the porsche and when i ask you, you say youre the only one whos allowed to drive it. 
<monica> yeah, well hes my brother! and plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it. 
<ross> its a car monica! not a rocket ship! 
<monica> whatever ross! just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after youre done. 
<joey>  hey! 
<ross> hey! 
<phoebe> hey! 
<joey> saw the porsche out there mon, lookin good. when do i get to take that baby out again? 
<rachel>  you let joey drive it?! 
<phoebe> ive never driven it! okay? not once! okay once. okay, i drive it all the time. 
<monica> nice work everybody! so much for the yknow, "you can drive it, but dont tell rachel" plan! 
<rachel> wow! i cant believe you lied to me. 
<phoebe> okay, i can fix this! okay monica, rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.  
<monica> great! well rachel, the reason why i wont let you drive the porsche is because youre a terrible driver. there! that wasnt about the wedding. 
<ross> look rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the porsche ill be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block. 
<joey> yeah, you got a couple hours? opening credits 
< 
<ross> whew! that was a brisk ride! 
<rachel> take the top down did ya? 
<ross> only way to fly.  
<rachel> come on ross give me the keys! monica does not know what shes talking about! i am an excellent driver! 
<ross> youre fast and irresponsible. that adds up to a bad driver. 
<rachel> well in high school, that added up to head cheerleader.  
<ross> did you see the look that girl just gave me? huh? she mustve seen me cruising in the bad boy. 
<rachel> i think shes checking out your beehive ross. 
<ross> what?!  give-give me a brush. 
<rachel> gimme the keys! 
<ross> no way! 
<rachel> well no brush! 
<ross> fine! yknow what? it doesnt matter, because, if i remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.  
<rachel>  alimony.  
< 
<monica> chandler, we still havent gotten an rsvp from your dad. 
<chandler> oh! right. umm, maybe thats because i didnt send him an invitation. 
<monica> chandler! hes your father; he should be at the wedding. 
<chandler> i dont even know the man. okay? were not that close. i havent seen him in years. 
<monica> well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?! 
<chandler> well he doesnt have to know! its not like we run in the same circles. i hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in vegas. 
<phoebe> ooh, i think i wanna trade circles. 
<chandler> trust me, you dont want him there either. okay? nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress. 
<monica> so what! as long as hes not wearing a white dress and a veil i dont care. 
<phoebe> okay, i think i need to do some shopping.  
< 
<rachel> ahhh!  ooh, nice!  
<rachel> my god! 
<ross> what do you think youre doing?! 
<rachel> just washing the windshield.  
<ross> there is no way i am letting you drive this car! so why dont you just hand over the keys? 
<rachel> oh. of the steering wheel. does anyone know why that is? its a tradition left over from porsches racing history. the worlds greatest endurance race is the 24 hours of lemans. which is in france and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on sunday.  in the 60s lemans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track. at the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car, buckle up, start the car, and drive off. porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took. since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat-belts, put the car in gear and start it. the drivers left hand did nothing. porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24-hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat-belts with his right hand. thats why every porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.} 
<ross> no ah-ah-ah! do not start this car!  okay! okay! i will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now!  
<rachel> look ross, if youre so freaked out, just get in the car! 
<ross> with you?! yeah right! 
<rachel> all right.  
<ross>  okay! okay! okay!  
<rachel> what are you doing?! get in the front! 
<ross> in the death seat?!! 
<rachel> oh my  
< 
<s> hey guys! 
<joey> hey!

<monica> here!  
<chandler> whats this? 
<monica> its your suitcase. were going to las vegas. 
<chandler> are you serious?! i mean like eloping?! no more stupid wedding stuff?! no more these flowers or these flowers or these flowersthink of the money well save!!  were not eloping. i love the flowers. can our wedding be bigger please? 
<monica> were going to las vegas to see your dad. its time you two talked, and i want to get to know my father-in-law. 
<chandler> yknow we already went over this and i won! 
<monica> no you didnt. oh and honey, just so you know, now that youre marrying me, you dont get to win anymore. 
<chandler> look forget it okay? i dont want to go. i dont want to see him. i dont wanna. 
<monica> chandler, look i-i know that your dad embarrassed you. i know 
<chandler> no-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, youd have to come up with a whole new word for what i went through. when i was in high school, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different hollywood starlet. yknow its hard enough to be fourteen. youre skinny. youre wearing speedosthat your mom promised that you would grow into! and you look up into the stands and theres your dad cheering you on dressed as carmen miranda. he was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack! 
<monica> hey, the point is that he was at every one of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! okay? thats a, thats a pretty great dad. 
<chandler> he had sex with mr. garibaldi! 
<monica> whos mr. garibaldi? 
<chandler> does it matter?! 
<monica> chandler, youre not fourteen anymore. okay? maybe its time that you let that stuff go. if your fathers not at your wedding youre gonna regret it for the rest of your life. 
<chandler> yeah o-okay, but im just doing this for you. 
<monica> yes! 
<chandler> so i really never get to win anymore? 
<monica> how much did ever really win before? 
< 
<joey> pheebs! 
<phoebe> hey! 
<joey> listen, you know how uh, when youre wearing pants and you lean forward i check out your underwear? 
<phoebe> yeah! 
<joey> well, when jake did it i saw that he was wearing womens underwear! 
<phoebe> i know. they were mine. 
<joey> oh.  no! no wait, thats weird! 
<phoebe> no, its not! we were just goofing around and i dared him to try them on. 
<joey> thats weird! 
<phoebe> im wearing his briefs right now. 
<joey> thats kinda hot. 
<phoebe> i think so too. and that little flap? great for holding my lipstick. 
<joey> yeah, i wouldnt know about that. 
<phoebe> and! yknow what jake says? that womens underwear is actually more comfortable. and he loves the way the silk feels against his skin. 
<joey> yeah well next thing you know, hell be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture! 
<phoebe> there is nothing wrong with jake! okay? he is all man! im thinking even more than you. 
<joey> oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys. 
<phoebe> im just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in womens underwear! i dont think you could ever do that. 
<joey> hey! i am secure with my masculinity. 
<phoebe> okay, whatever. 
<joey> youve seen my huge stack of porn, right?  
< 
<rachel> god. i forgot how much i love driving. i have got to get my license renewed. 
<ross>  you dont have a valid drivers licenseokay that is it! pull over right now!

<monica> why not?! 
<chandler> i dont know if ive told you this, but hes kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years

<rachel> ill figure something out. 
<phoebe> all right. good luck.

<rachel> umm im never gonna getting married! 
<monica> yeah you will! the right guy is just around the corner! okay, are we done with that? 
<rachel> no monica! im serious! oh, maybe i should just forget about it. become a lesbian or something. 
<monica> any woman would be lucky to have ya. 
<rachel> well maybe it would make me feel better if i slept with joey. 
<monica>  rachel! you okay? 
< 
<joey> excuse me, aaron?  hi! umm, i have a little problem with the schedules. originally, i wasnt supposed to work today, and i have this wedding that i really have to be at. its my best friends, and im officiating so i really cant work past four. 
<s> joey, you gotta stay until the end. we cant stop filming just for you. its not like its your wedding.  
<joey> im having surgery! 
<s> what?! 
<joey> yeah, i-i just made up the stuff about the wedding because i didnt want you to worry about me. but, im having surgery today. 
<s> what kind of surgery?! 
<joey> transplant. 
<s> but youre supposed to work on monday. 
<joey> hair transplant. 
<s> but youre not bald. 
<joey> its not on my head. 
<s> look joey, theres nothing i can do. besides, youre probably gonna be out by four anyway. weve just got one short scene. its just you and richard, and god knows hes a pro. youll be fine.  morning richard. 
<joey> hey! youre here! great! great! great! lets get going buddy, weve got a scene to shoot! 
<s> im wearing two belts. 
<joey> are you drunk? 
<s> no! 
<joey> yes you are! 
<s> all right. 
< 
<ross> we are never gonna find him! hes one guy in a huge city! 
<phoebe> oh my god! is that him?  
<ross> that is an old, chinese woman! 
<phoebe> he could be in disguise, yknow. 
<ross> aw, yknow yknow, maybe were-were just approaching this all wrong. if youre chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on earth people would think youd go?  
<ross> so this is your office? 
<chandler> how did you guys find me? i knew i shouldve hid at the gym! 
<phoebe> what the hell are you doing?! 
<chandler> panicking! and using the internet to try to prove that im related to monica. how is she? 
<ross> shes fine. she doesnt know youre gone. and she doesnt have to know, okay? now come on, were going home. 
<chandler> no! no! no! i cant do that! 
<phoebe> why not?! 
<chandler> because if i go home, were gonna become the bings! i cant be the bings! 
<ross> whats wrong with being the bings? 
<chandler> the bings have horrible marriages! they yell. they fight. and they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games! 
<ross> chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room? 
<chandler> no. 
<ross> then you are neither of your parents! 
<chandler> its not just their marriage! i mean, look at yours. look at everybodys! the only person that can make marriage work is paul newman! and ive met me; i am not paul newman. i dont race cars! i dont make popcorn! none of my proceeds go to charity. 
<phoebe> but look chandler, right now no-one has a lower opinion of you than i do. but i totally believe you can do this. 
<chandler> i want to. i love her so much, but im afr its too huge. 
<ross> yknow, okay. youre right. it is huge. so why dont we take it just a little bit at a time? okay? umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. can you just come home and take a shower?

<phoebe> well you obviously didnt see chucky 3. 
<chandler> but come on, look at how cute and small this is! so i got it to give monica so shed know i was okay.

<s> oh i wish your grandmother had lived to see this. 
<monica> shes right there. 
<s> not that old crow, my mother.  congratulations darling. 
<s> i love you sweetheart.   
<chandler> you look beautiful. is this new?  
<monica> not now. 
<chandler> okay.  
<monica>  who is this? 
<chandler>  hes greek orthodox. 
<rachel>  as are you 
<joey>  thats my line!  i can take it from here, thanks.  dearly beloved, im sorry im a little late. you may be confused by this now,  but you wont be memorial day weekend 2002. well, lets get started before the groom takes off again. huh?  we are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. ive known monica and chandler for a long time, and i can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. and now, as ive left my notes in my dressing room, we shall proceed to the vows. monica?  
<monica>  he took off? 
<rachel> go on! go on.  
<monica> chandler, for so long i i wondered if i would ever find my prince, my soul mate. then three years ago, at another wedding i turned to a friend for comfort. and instead, i found everything that id ever been looking for my whole life. and now here we are with our future before us and i only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. unless you dont want to. you go! 
<joey> chandler?  
<chandler>  no, thats okay.  monica i thought this was going to be the most difficult thing i ever had to do. but when i saw you walking down that aisle i realized how simple it was. i love you. any surprises that come our way, its okay, because i will always love you. you are the person i was meant to spend the rest of my life with. you wanna know if im sure?  
<joey> you may not kiss the bride. so, i guess by the powers vested in me by the state of new york and the internet guys, i now pronounce you husband and wife. oh wait! do you take each other? 
<chandler> i do. 
<monica> i do. 
<joey> yeah you do! 
<ross> rings? 
<joey> aw crap! okayuh uh lets-lets do the rings.  
<joey> we good? yeah? good? once again, i pronounce you husband and wife.  now kiss her again.  
<chandler>  i love you. and i know about the baby. 
<monica> what baby? 
<chandler> our baby. 
<monica> we have a baby? 
<chandler> phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash. 
<monica> i didnt take a pregnancy test. 
<chandler> then who did?  
<phoebe> oh and theyre gonna have a baby. 
<rachel> uh-huh.   ending credits this is a special out-takes episode. the cast and conan are sitting around the set of central perk, talking about the stuff weve never seen. of the scene settings i will be using the current arrangements. even though some of the out-takes take place when chandler was living with joey and rachel was living with monica, when joey and chandler were living in monica and rachels, and the current arrangements. 
< 
<s> its a tradition here on friends after every taping for me to hang out with you guys,  talk down the episode umm the point of this it looks like a smooth running machine, but behind the scenes theres deceit, mistrust, and hate. and i thought, i thought wed actually take a look at uh, yknow some of these moments where you guys arethere are mistakes. you make mistakes. 
<s> once and a while. 
<s> from time to time. 
<s> for example, i dont have to memorize lines. you guys actually have to remember what to say and you probably forget from time to time. yes? 
<s> our energy just comes way up when theres an audience here, and when that happens, something happens between your brain and your mouth sometimes and it just doesnt, it just doesnt work.  
<ross> uh, oh-oh, umm no you didnt. i did. 
<chandler> oh uh-uh, no-no-no-no-uh-uh.   
<phoebe> so, we realize thatoh no  im telling it! im telling it   
<joey> ha-ha. lookcome on, i dont know what to do or say.   
<joey> ha-ha, very funny. i dont know what to do! yknow? holy crud!  
<joey> ha-ha-ha, very funny. look, i dont know what to do!  
<s> it is one of those days!  
<phoebe> xcusa seniora, voulez-bere quakayuck it! 
<s> wow pheebs, you-you speak gutter?  
<s> you still get nervous everybody just before a show? 
<s> absolutely. 
<s> everybody. 
<s> its amazing, like all week long weve-weve been saying the same lines and then the audience is here and we will mess up, and if you mess up once then youll get nervous because youllyou know youll probably mess up again.  
<s> action! 
<monica>  when you were little you slept through-through the grand canyon. 
<s> watch again that hand. 
<s> thisll be five/ten takes. 
<s> okay. 
<s> okay. you know its gonna happen. 
<s> once again, and action! 
<monica>  when-when you were little you slept through the grand canyon.  
<s> oh! okay! im gonna try it without the coffee cup cause i think its the left hand thats messing me up.  
<monica> when you were little you slept through the grandoh fffff .  
<monica> sorry, lets go back! cause youve got more to say. 
<s> do i? absolutely. absolutely. yeah, thats your fault. i say.  
<s> i love you. 
<s> i love you!   
<s> but there must be, there mustare a lot of moments over the years where youre just trying to do your job, something goes wrong.  
<joey> hey and, this is a little extra something for yknow, always being there for me.  
<s> hey joey! the camera hit our wall! 
<s> what?!  
<s> ahh! shit that hurt! 
<s> are you okay?    
<chandler> hey rach!   
<joey> oh yeah? then how come i keep  
<monica> it was so wild! we told em we were the gundersons in 16  
<s>  i spit on her!  
<s>  operation. you had a fun one. 
<s> oh yeah! 
<s> with operation. 
<s> it was a little game. yeah, with an electric buzzer.  
<phoebe> oh-ooh, and i brought operation, but umm i lost the umm  its making a noise.  
<s> but le blanc really doesnt mess up much. 
<s> you dont verbally mess up, but sometimes physically? you mess up. 
<s> i have had some clumsy moments, i guess you can call em.   
<s> he fell down once! and we re-did it and we went back. and hehe was afraid he was gonna fall down 
<s> you could actually see him trying not to fall down.  
<joey> pheebs!  check it out!   
<s> this particular time when he continued to fall or yknow, try not to fall, i was in the room with matthew and matthew was like, "should i do it?"  
<joey> pheebs! check it out! check it out! check it out! check it out!  
<phoebe> ooh, soap opera digest!   
<s> matthew, you have a reputation with the rest of the cast that sometimes you like to, you like to fool around a bit. i mean like if somethings naturally going wrong you like to get in there and juice it a little bit. true or false? 
<s> i dont necessarily like to juice things 
<s> he said true or false!  
<joey> oh! ooh-ooh! 
<monica> what are you doing?! 
<joey> youre still a tiny bit on fire there. 
<monica> oh geez! okay! thanks!   
<s> it was great seeing you the other night. 
<monica> well, it was good to see you too. did you come down here to tell me that? 
<s> noo! i came down here to tell you something else. i came here to tell you i still love you.  
<chandler> what the fuck are you doing?!  
<s> now you guys work with animals a lot. you had to work early on with a monkey 
<s> that damn monkey. 
<s> that damn monkey. 
<rachel> okay. okay, see now the one with the feather boa? thats dr. francis. she used to be a man. oh look! there okay. katie, come here katie.  very good.  
<s> lisas laugh though so infectious. its one of those things just forget about it. once it starts, its all gone.  
<rachel> no yknow, i dont want to switch! come on! i can throw wet paper towels here! 
<phoebe> well at monicas you can eat 
<s> okay, shh yeah. cause its not silly. 
<s> here we go. 
<s> okay. 
<s> and action! 
<rachel> no-no ph-ph-ph-ph   
<s>  ready? 
<s> yeah.   
<s> and then it just builds on itself and theres no doing the scene after. i mean you probably wait and really get it together and do it. 
<s> for me, i have a hard time with le blanc in particular. when-wheni mean when 
<s>  you bastard. 
<s> yeah, what did i do? 
<s> i keep a straight face he-he delivers like this look, a reaction to you, or a certain take, i-ii mean i find it so funny.  
<joey> mornin 
<ross> mornin   
<joey> i mean what kind of an actor, what kind of an actor cant even say, "hmm, noodle soup?"  
<s> thats a good one?  
<s> now, we should go back and take the other line. 
<s> okay, ill just put a little more booze on there.  
<ross> i think, subconsciously 
<joey>  nope, you lost me.  
<s> no! come on!  
<joey> okay, the next situation is for rachel. the wedding is about to start, you walk into the back room and you find monica taking a nap with ross.  ill be monica. go!  
<ross>  no! no! no!   
<s> well be right back with more friends, less me.  
<s> im doing my brother. 
<s> thats gross. commercial break  
<s> you uh, youve worked withthey always say a performer should never work with pets or children. 
<s> aww, the kids.  
<s> action. 
<rachel> okay. nowwhat is my first line? 
<s>  what did we agree? 
<s> okay  
<s> the good thing about the young kids though, theyre completely unpredictable. which is a lot of fun as an actor to respond with. but there was one story 
<s> oh little ben. 
<s> where the story was that i was anticipating that i would be around to hear my sons first words spoken. but the scene was about that he wasnt supposed to be able to speak and, uh for some reason when we started doing the show  
<ross> hi! were visiting! 
<rachel> yay! 
<ross> its ben and his da-da. da-da? can you say da-da? yknow, you might as well say it because i told your 
<s> da da.  
<ross> can you say da-da? see, im gonna tell your mommies you said it anyway, so you might as well try 
<s> da da. 
<ross> huh? 
<s> da da. 
<s> yeah, hes saying da-da.  
<s> and then sometimes during the show yknow but youre like, the scenes going one way but youre just tempted to say something another time. like, do you remember that one where monicas baking cookies in our old apartment? 
<s> shes trying to intrigue us to hang out with her. 
<s> yeah, shes trying to waft the smell across the hall to get us to come hang out in her new place, and were sitting there eating pizza and i think it was you  that said  
<phoebe> what do i smell?  
<s> i think i was supposed to say, "i dont know," and go over and open the door. and i went  
<phoebe> what do i smell? 
<joey>  sorry.   
<s>  and then it was like four takes later before we could get through it with a straight face.  
<phoebe> what do i smell?  
<s> le blanc.  
<phoebe> what do i smell? 
<joey> i dont know, but it smells good.   
<s> but audiencesyou have a live studio audience and they must love that. they must love it when they see you guys playing.  
<chandler> what are you guys doing?  
<ross> nothing. 
<joey> nothin.  
<s> so that you will intentionally do something thattheyll-theyll intentionally screw it up? 
<s> yeah! 
<s> yeah!  
<s>  why? whats the matter?   
<s>  you-youve worn a fat suit on the show. and, a lot of people love you in the fat suit. do you like wearing the fat suit? is it fun?  
<s> im melting!  
<s> they made me dance, in the fat suit.   
<s> i-i heard some of you guys talking about this earlier, but sometimes theres just a word that someone has to say that youll get hung up on. and itll justthe way you say the word is funny to everybody else.  
<ross> that tastes like feet!  
<s> it tastes like  feet! 
<s> okay, were good. 
<s> action! 
<ross> that tastes like feet!   
<s> sometimes the dialogue itself is just so funny and youllwell be rehearsing during the week and you justwhatever-whatever the joke is; its so funny we cant get through it in rehearsal and just 
<s> you just know. 
<s> you-you mentally make a flag on it and you say, "okay show night, im justill never be able to get through this."  
<monica> are you saying that you dont want to get with this? 
<chandler> you see, i dont say  
<phoebe>  oh, sweet jesus! oh! monica, these are the  cookies they serve in hell!  
<chandler>  whoa! shes purty! 
<joey> oh yeah, and shes really nice too! she taught me about yknow, how to work with the cameras and smell-the-fart acting. 
<monica> joey? 
<rachel> im sorry 
<ross> excuse me, what?   
<s> when you have to do physical business for a scene, i mean there must be; there must be a lot of funny moments when you have to physically do a task as part of a scene. 
<s> yeah, rachel, chandler, and ross had to try to get a couch up a staira very narrow new york stairwell and that was probably i-i think it was the hardest ive-ive laughed in my life period.  
<ross> pivot!  pivot!  okay, pivot! piv-at!   
<ross> pivot! piv-at! piv-at!! 
<chandler> shut up! shut up! shut up!!  
<s> pivat!!  pivat!!! commercial break  
<s> youve done over 150 episodes, but your favorite moments that 80 years from now youll be thinking about? 
<s> it is when were able to crack each other up.  
<chandler> monicas gotta have the phone in the right place and 
<ross>  all right! all right! all right!  we are fixing it.  
<s> hes gone. hes   
<s> we enjoy watching each other. and i settle for watching each others performance, and we like each other.  
<ross> oh the bands ready! and welli-iwe gotta do what the band says, right? i dont care about the stinkin band!!   
<s> okay friends gang, thanks for doing it. 
<s> well thank you so much.

<monica> find some! please! anything that doesnt say i-i died tragically in france.  
<s> well then why dont we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids. 
<phoebe> okay.  hey mon, why did you tell the guys you werent pregnant? 
<monica> because im not. 
<phoebe> we found your test in the trash, if youre not pregnantits because i am.  
<chandler> what?! what are you talking about? 
<monica> what are you talking about? 
<phoebe> yes, i i am with child.  and i didnt want to say anything because its your day; i didnt want to steal your thunder. 
<monica> wait a minute! so you told people i was pregnant?!  does this look like a conversation that i want to remember?! 
<chandler> whos the father? 
<monica> yeah! 
<phoebe> i cant say. 
<monica> why?! 
<chandler> why not? 
<phoebe> i cant say because hes famous.

<rachel> for you.  
<phoebe> oh my god! 
<rachel> oh, thank you for doing that. i just cant deal with this just quite yet.

<monica> well i-i talked to and uh, shes definitely going to have this baby. yknow, she said she was gonna raise it on her own. 
<rachel> well, maybe thats, maybe thats really brave. 
<monica> maybe. i just hope she realizes how hard its gonna be. 
<rachel> maybe she hasnt really thought it through that well. 
<monica> well, theres a lot to think about. i mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? how is she going to juggle work? does she realize shes not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years? 
<rachel>  i dont know. 
<monica> are you okay?

<joey> i dont have a key, they took mine to give to you. 
<phoebe> what?! they took mine to give to you! 
<joey> why would they take away our keys? 
<phoebe> maybe they dont trust us. 
<joey> no thats not it. they let me keep my key the last time they were out of town. 
<phoebe> you mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with monicas guest towels?

<ross> yeah. uh, uh we promised we werent gonna tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago rachel and i slept together. 
<phoebe>  and? 
<ross> wow! i thought you would be a little more shocked. 
<phoebe> oh sorry.  and?! 
<ross> well, we-we said wed just do it that one time but, but now i think she may wanna start things up again. 
<joey> yeah, i dont think thats what it is. 
<ross> why? what-what else could it be? 
<joey> oh wow, i dont feel well. 
<ross> im telling you. im telling you. thats what it is. no wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. she didnt say anything to you? 
<phoebe>  maybe its something you ate? 
<joey> please, just-just, just go and talk to rachel. 
<ross> yeah, i guess i should.  man, yknow what i have to realize? maybe im just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. yknow, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. i should remember that.  
<  
<monica> theyre kissing lets just go around them. 
<chandler> oh honey, leave them alone, theyre in love.

<ross> okay.  uh, ross and rachel. rachel and ross. thats been one heck of a see-saw hasnt it? 
<rachel>  what? 
<ross> i mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and and certainly passionate, but dont you think its better if we just stayed friends? 
<rachel> seriously. what?!

<ross> you already know dont you? 
<phoebe> a little bit. 
<joey> how are you doing? 
<ross> okay. okay. i mean ill be okay. its just i dont think i handled it very well. 
<joey> well, what did you say to her? 
<ross> nothing. but the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. and then when i turned around she was gone. 
<phoebe> oh ross. 
<ross> but hey, in my defense i-i just found out condoms are like only 97% effective. 
<joey>  what? 
<ross> i gotta go find her. 
<joey> whoa! hey! whoa!! hold up! are you serious?! so like 3% of the time they dont even work?! huh? they should put that on the box!

<ross> right! right! i justi want you to know that im going to be there through this whole thing, okay? okay? the doctors appointments, the uh, the lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartmentalthough we could probably worry about that til after we get married. 
<rachel> what married? 
<ross> well yeah, i think we should get married. 
<rachel> what, because thats your answer to everything? 
<ross> no, because thats the right thing to do. 
<rachel> yeah, maybe if youre in love. but ross, we are not in love, are we? 
<ross> no but but still you cant possibly do this alone. 
<rachel> excuse me? 
<ross> come on rach, you cant even eat alone in a restaurant. 
<rachel> what?! 
<ross> im just saying if you cant eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself? 
<rachel> i can too eat by myself! 
<ross> when have you ever? 
<rachel> when certain people leave the table and i am not finished! 
<ross> well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup! 
<rachel> oh please, you inhale your food! 
<ross> i grew up with monica! if you didnt eat fast you didnt eat!! 
<rachel> oh no dr. long, please come in. this is ross, he is the father.

<ross> theres the one! 
<rachel> but you did! i mean, lets be honest.

<chandler> yeah, were gonna need to see that tape.  
<monica> yeah, definitely. 
<ross> what a great idea! that will get rachel to forgive me!

<ross> thank you.  no! 
<joey> youre right.  
<ross> joey! no! 
<joey> loud and clear!   
< 
<monica> i still don't get why greg and jenny would give us a fake number. 
<joey> yknow, if they knew what they were doing they probably didnt give you real names either. 
<monica> okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they dont give out fake names. 
<joey> oh yeah?  hi, ken adams, nice to meet you. 
<phoebe> regina philange.  
<chandler> i still dont get it, we didnt do anything wrong. 
<monica> i know! although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes. 
<chandler> i thought you said those jokes were funny. joke! joke! joke! 
<monica>  joke. joke. blah! blah!  
<chandler> well maybe it was all of your questions. 
<monica> what about my questions? 
<chandler> the sheer volume, it was like flying with the riddler! 
<monica> oh, im sorry. was that another joke? 
<chandler>  was that another question? 
<rachel>  hey! is ross still here? 
<joey> uh no rach, hes gone. but listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake. 
<rachel> oh really? well how would you like it if i had sex with you and i taped it?  oh forget it!  oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village. 
<ross> look, it was accident! okay? i-i feel bad that it happened, but i swear, i didnt even watch it! anyway, here.  i thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself.  
<rachel> thank you.  what?  you dont want to see this do you? 
<monica> hell yeah!!! 
<rachel> i am not gonna show you this! 
<phoebe> no! not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it. 
<ross> forget it, shes destroying it. 
<phoebe> okay fine! fine! well just have to think of some other way to put the whole who came onto who, thing to rest! come on now, think!! 
<ross> look, forget it phoebe. okay? its rachels tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. and she wants to destroy it. so, end of story.

<ross> five years?! chandler you have to tell him! 
<chandler> no! that would be so awkward! lookbesides, we work in different departments. hes on the sixth floor yknow? so he calls me toby once in a while. whats the big deal? it could be worse, its not like hes calling me muriel.

<phoebe> but why?! 
<monica> because hes terrible! okay, hes slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire! 
<phoebe> well maybe he was just nervous, yknow you can be very intimidating. and besides ive met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two. 
<monica> well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished. 
<phoebe> but monica, he loves his job so much! can you just give him another chance? please? 
<monica>  all right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there! 
<phoebe> thats fair! thank you so much. thanks. oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too. 
<monica> i paid to have this done.

<joey> i said no. 
<rachel> what?! 
<joey> what? i i just figured since youre pregnant youre not gonna be seeing people. 
<rachel> okay joey, first of all kash ford is not people. second of all, what did he say when you told him i was pregnant? 
<joey> i didnt tell him. i didnt know if you were telling people. this is back when i thought kash was still people. 
<rachel> good-good, dont tell him. dont tell him. just have him call me okay?

<rachel> okay, you go do it! ill come back to that set! ill meet more actors! ill meet em all!

<chandler> bob? ooh, working here with us? everyday? yeah, i dont know if he has what it takes.

<chandler> i think its best sir. starting to pile up. ive got a stack of documents on my desk this high.  
<chandler> yknow what you should do, just toss em in the shedder and claim you never got em. 
<chandler> what does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?! 
< 
<phoebe> hey! 
<monica> hey. okay, i gave him another chance, but tim has got to go! 
<phoebe> but 
<monica> no! no-no! he is totally incompetent. i called the chef who recommended him to me. he said, "ha-ha! gotcha!" 
<phoebe> okay. okay, but you cant fire him today. 
<monica> why not?! 
<phoebe> because im dumping him today. 
<monica> what?! you said he was sweet! 
<phoebe> he is sweet. hes too sweet. he calls me all the time.  "so did-did you get home from work okay?" "did-did you get out of the shower okay?" 
<monica> just dont pick up your phone. 
<phoebe> then he comes over!  "im so worried about you." uck! be a man! 
<monica> what? so now im not allowed to fire him? 
<phoebe> you cant fire him and dump him the same day, hell kill himself. 
<monica> okay well then, ill fire him today and you go out with him for another week. 
<phoebe> are you kidding?! another week with that sip, ill kill myself! 
<monica> okay well, then well both do it today and hell just have to deal with it! 
<phoebe> okay. but the question is whos gonna go first. cause whoever goes second is the bitch. 
<monica> what do you mean? 
<phoebe> come on! the boss that fires a guy thats just been dumped, bitch! and the woman who dumps a guy thats just been fired, blond bitch! 
<monica> i wanted to do this days ago so i think i should go first. 
<phoebe> all right, that makes sense.  ugh. butscrew you im going first!

<ross> so does-does joey know youre moving? 
<rachel> well, i havent discussed it with him yet, but i know hes gonna be relieved. last week, he brought this girl over and i started talking to her about morning sickness and then i showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.

<monica> dont you see? its the perfect crime! 
<chandler> she mustve been planning this for years! 
<monica> i will prove it to you! okay? about a week ago i was wearing those jeans and i dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. now when she comes back i will find it and show you that stain! 
<chandler> honey, isnt it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair? 
<monica> i guess. 
<chandler> so, shouldnt we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go snooping around her crotch? 
<monica> fine. im just glad i didnt give her my secret ingredient. 
<chandler> out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient? 
<monica> yeah!

<phoebe> look eric, turn around.  look, i like you, but it shouldnt be this hard. yknow? this is our first date yknow? first dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand? and yknow first kisses and  second kisses.

<rachel> honey, its not just a matter of where you put it. i mean a baby changes everything. they cry all the time. i mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when theres a screaming baby around. 
<joey> i could use a challenge! its getting pretty easy. 
<rachel> honey, its so sweet that you want me to stay, but i-i cant do that to you. i mean it would disrupt your entire life. 
<joey> i love living with you so much. i just wish things didnt have to change.

<monica> i would do it but she thinks im attracted to her! 
<chandler> why?

<chandler> you see that? 
<monica> do you see this?  
<chandler> all right. yes. okay. i get your point. but if its not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!

<rachel> joey, are you sure? 
<joey> yeah! all rightlook, i know sometimes itll be hard, okay? but, itll also be really really great. please rachel! i-i-i really want you to stay.

<chandler> i cant believe there is a naked hooker in there! 
<joey> wait! wait! maybe shes a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what shes supposed to do. 
<chandler> could be. i mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it.  maam, are you also a stripper? 
<s> uh, no. but i could pretend to strip, but thats gonna cost extra. okay, heres the extras, handcuffs, spanking  
<joey> maybe monicas playing a joke on ya. yknow? getting her own husband a hooker, thats pretty funny. 
<chandler> that is funny, maybe for my birthday shell murder someone. 
<joey> i bet ross was in on it too. i mean he was conveniently busy. 
<s> do you mind if i smoke in here? 
<chandler> oh actually, id rather you yeah, go ahead. were gonna have to burn that room down anyway. 
< 
<s> how could you have kept all of this from me? 
<ross> i was going to tell you, but 
<s> but what?! you figured youd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped rachel! 
<ross> hey! i did not dump rachel!  nor are we still together.  can i just  why dont we just let the machine get that? 
<joey>  hey ross. its joey. theres a hooker over here and we thought maybe youd know something about it.

<s> when theyre hookers. 
<monica> oh my god stu! i-i cant believe you did this! now are you absolutely sure shes a hooker? 
<s> either that or shes just the best, most expensive date i ever had.  
< 
<joey> maybe she meant to get you a hooker. 
<chandler> why would she do that? 
<joey> maybe she wants you to learn something. huh? now is there anything youre really bad at yknow, sexually? 
<chandler> this is the worst bachelor party ever! 
<s> whats taking you boys so long? 
<joey> in a minute! 
<chandler>  in a minute? whats gonna happen in a minute?! 
<joey> all right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.

<s> oh good, youre here. yeah, and i was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable. 
<rachel> i know mona, just hear me out. first of all, im so sorry about my father yelling at you, but i heard you totally held your own. youre gonna have to tell me how you did that. 
<ross> focus. 
<rachel> okay. um butokay, yes ross and i used to date. and yes we are gonna have a baby. but we are definitely not getting back together. 
<s> how can i be sure on that? 
<rachel> oh we justwe drove each other crazy! 
<ross> yeah. 
<rachel> i mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go! 
<ross> trying to date this woman. 
<rachel> right! but, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is.  
<ross> probably shouldnt touch me. 
<s> yknow, i-i-i just i dont want to get in the middle of something so complicated. 
<rachel> i know, i get it, but mona, what relationship is not complicated? i mean we all have our baggage! you must too! why else would you still be single?  i am so gonna leave right now.  
<ross> should i leave this open for you too? 
<s> im not sure yet. why didnt you just tell me about all this? 
<ross> because whats going on with rachel has nothing to do with how i feel about you. 
<s> yeah? well you still shoulda told me. 
<ross> i know and i was going to, but i thought it was better that you heard it from rachels father. look i i made a mistake, but its only because i really, really like you. really! 
<s> okay, i guess you can close the door now.  
<rachel>  forgot my purse!  oh, you guys made up.  hes a good kisser isnt he?  im going!

<rachel> yes!  bye daddy.  
<s>  theres gonna be a wedding!  thats unacceptable rachel! what the hell does love have to do with it anyway?! there are more important things in a marriage other than love!  constantly thinking about things! you have to think about the consequences of your decision.  
<joey>  hey! i do too think about the consequences of my decisions!  what gives you the right to  go to hell! (hangs up the phone and 
< 
<joey> hey rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back. 
<rachel>  oh my god! let me see that!  
<joey>  you fall for it every time! 
<phoebe>  hey! 
<rachel> hi! 
<phoebe> i brought you my old maternity clothes!  
<rachel> oh pheebs thats so sweetooh, those are so cute!

<monica>  oh good youre all here. thanksgiving tomorrow, four oclock.  oh, guess who i invited. remember that guy will colbert from high school? 
<rachel> no. 
<monica> he was in rosss class marching band kinda overweight? well, really overweight. i mean i was his thin friend. 
<rachel> wow! i dont remember him. honey, are you sure youre not talking about your imaginary boyfriend. 
<monica> no that was jarred! wow! i havent thought about him in a long time  anyway, umm wills, wills here on business and he didnt have a place to go so i invited him here. 
<rachel> oh thats nice. 
<monica> oh, and by the way, hes lost a bunch of weight. i mean he looks goo-ood! okay, i mean really, really gorgeous!  i still love chandler. 
<joey> i just want you to say it once in a while. 
<monica> all right okay, just so you know, im not gonna make a turkey this year. 
<joey> what?! 
<monica> well phoebe doesnt eat turkey 
<joey> phoebe! 
<phoebe> turkeys are beautiful, intelligent animals! 
<joey> no theyre not! theyre ugly and stupid and delicious! 
<monica> all right! okay, its just phoebe. wills still on a diet, chandler doesnt eat thanksgiving food, and rachels having her aversion to poultry. 
<joey> she is? 
<rachel> remember i had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken? 
<joey> yeah. but i thought that was because i put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table. 
<monica> anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. okay? its a lot of work. 
<joey> but you gotta have turkey on thanksgiving! i mean, thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like fourth of july with no apple pie! or friday with no two pizzas! 
<monica> all right fine! if it means that much to you! but justtheres gonna be a ton left over. 
<joey> no there wont! i promise i will finish that turkey! 
<monica> all right, youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting? 
<joey> thats right! cause im a tribbiani!  and this is what we do! i mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we dont read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! we can eat! opening credits

<s> i said it was typical. typical of you, rachel green, queen rachel does whatever she wants in little rachel land.  
<joey>  seriously, who is this guy? 
<rachel> umm, im sorry. do you-do you have a problem with me? 
<s> i dont know? do i? do i?

<s> me and ross.  
<ross> no need to point, she knows who ross is. commercial break 
< 
<rachel>  so you were in an i hate rachel club? 
<s> yes he was.  
<ross> no. no. 
<rachel> so who else was in this club? 
<ross> uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from thailand but i-i dont think he-he knew what it was. 
<rachel> so ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an i hate rachel club. 
<s> you went out with her?! we had a pact! 
<ross> that was in high school! its not like it was binding forever. 
<s> then why did it have the word eternity in it? 
<rachel> okay monica, did you know about this?! 
<monica> i swear i didnt.  hey! is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door? 
<monica> hmm, a little relieved, i gotta say. 
<ross> look rach i-im sorry, okay? i i was a stupid kid, okay? the only reason i joined 
<s> co-founded! 
<ross> co-founded. co-founded the club was because i was insanely in love with you. obviously i didnt handle it very well. but if you think about it the i hate rachel club was really the i love rachel club. 
<s> uh, except that it was really the i hate rachel club. 
<rachel> okay. so what? you guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me? 
<s> well, we did a little more than that. 
<ross> no-no! no-no. no-no. 
<phoebe> what?! what else did you do? 
<s> we started a rumor. 
<rachel> what rumor? 
<phoebe> oh, come on will! just take off your shirt and tell us! 
<rachel> ross! 
<ross> it was no big deal. we-we said that the rumor was that umm you had both male and female reproductive parts. 
<rachel> what?! 
<s> thats right! we said your parents flipped a coin, decided to raise you as a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis. 
<rachel>  oh my god! 
<monica> you started that?! 
<rachel> what?! you heard that?!  
<monica> everyone at our school heard it! 
<chandler> everybody at my school heard it! you were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from long island?! 
<rachel> oh no!!!! oh my god!! this is all making so much sense to me now! this is why adam carter wouldnt go out with me! this is why billy tratt would just stay in this region!  
<ross> actually, billy tratt is gay now. so-so that ones not really our fault. 
<rachel> monica, how come you never told me this?! 
<monica> i thought it might be true. and i was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.  
<rachel> joey stop staring! theres nothing there! its not true! 
<joey> im afraid im gonna need proof. 
<rachel> oh!  the turkey, until he turns the plate around and reveals he only ate one side.] 
<joey> you are my everest. 
<monica> joey, you dont have to finish that. 
<joey> oh yes i do. otherwise whats next? today im just a guy who cant finish a turkey, but tomorrow im the guy who eats half a powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? no! no, i just i justi gotta change my pants.  jeans have no give.  
<rachel>  okay! okay! listen to what sean mcmahon wrote in my yearbook senior year, "dear rach, youre such a good person." not girl! person! 
<ross> rach, i think youre reading a little too much into it. 
<rachel>  "dear rach, youre a great person. sorry about your tiney-wienie."  
<ross> look, what do you want me to do? do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasnt true?! 
<rachel> yes! 
<s> could you also tell them im skinny now? 
<monica> oh! me too! 
<ross> well look-look im not calling anybody! okay? it was like a million years ago! 
<rachel> i dont care how long ago it was! you told people that i was half and half! yknow what? i just want to point out i never did anything to hurt you in high school. 
<monica> thats not totally true. 
<rachel> what? 
<ross> what? 
<monica> well you-you did start that rumor about ross making out with mrs. altman, our 50-year-old librarian. 
<ross>  how did you know that?!!!! 
<monica> its true?!! 
<ross> no. 
<rachel> yes it is! i saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!  
<s> mrs. altman? she also made out with takaka ci-kek the night before he went back to thailand. 
<chandler> im sorry. when you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman? 
<ross> hey! she didnt look 50! 
<chandler> did she look 16? 
<rachel> ohh, theres a picture of her in the yearbook actually. 
<phoebe> oh!  wow! 
<ross> she didnt photograph well! 
<chandler> well, she probably wasnt familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings! 
<phoebe> so how did this happen? did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner? 
<ross> i was working late in the library one afternoon. it was just the two of us. she needed some help with her word jumble. and one thing led to another. if you must know, anita was very gentle and tender. may she rest in peace 
<monica> didnt she walk with a cane? 
<ross> only when it was damp!!  i cant believe you-you told people about this?! everybody knew?! yknow what?  im back in the club! 
<s> yeah!  
<phoebe> i wanna join! 
<rachel> whphoebe!! 
<phoebe> im sorry. im sorry. i never got to be in a club. i-i didnt go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn french. bonjour. 
<rachel> all right, yknowfine! you guys have your stupid little club, but i would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what i did to you! you gave me a tiney-wienie!  
<monica> all right, listen youre just being silly. rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. one girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a tootsie roll! 
<rachel> wow 
<monica> and ross, if it werent for rachels rumor i mean no one in high school would even know who you were. she put you on the map! 
<ross> as a romancer of the elderly. 
<monica> hey! mrs. altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty. 
<ross> the eyes did still sparkle. 
<monica> hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. you-youve been through so much since then. and right now youve got so much more important stuff going on in your life. cant you just let this go? 
<rachel> shes right. 
<ross> yeah. i mean we are having a baby together. 
<s> hold on! you got her pregnant? 
<ross> yeah. 
<s> are ya getting married? 
<ross> nope. 
<s> so you knocked her up but youre not gonna marry her. dude!  anybody? 
<phoebe> okay.  its exactly how id imagined it would be. 
<joey>  all right wheres that turkey! 
<phoebe> joey! those are my maternity pants!

<ross> what are you reading? the kidnappers guide to manhattan private schools? 
<phoebe> no, its new york magazine. its an article about the best schools in the city. so how well do you know sting? 
<ross> uh, i actually havent even met him. 
<phoebe> uh-huh, yeah thats too bad. i really want to go to his concert friday night, but its totally sold out. i know! why dont you meet him and get tickets?! if you get two ill take you.

<monica> hey guys! 
<chandler> hey-hey.

<rachel> hi boots. 
<monica> see chandler? im getting a lot of use out of them already! theyre very practical. see, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants 
<chandler> you can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them.  
<phoebe> wow! theyre beautiful! 
<rachel> ahh 
<monica>  they hurt so much! 
<phoebe> what?! 
<monica> the guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die! 
<rachel> well-well you can give them to me! i havent felt my feet in years! 
<monica> i cant! i spent so much money on them and i told chandler that id wear them all the time, i just cant give them away! 
<phoebe> well then get your money back and return them! 
<monica> i cant do that either! the soles are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood. 
<ross>  hey! 
<chandler>  hey! 
<ross> hey i uh just picked up ben from school 
<chandler>  i dont think you did a very thorough job! 
<ross> i dropped him off at carols.  anyway, it turns out that im not going to be able to get those tickets though. 
<phoebe> oh no! why not? 
<ross> well it turns out that ben and stings son do not get along. 
<phoebe> how come?! 
<ross> apparently, stings son made fun of the fact that bens moms are lesbinims. 
<phoebe> wait! but ross if they dont get along then you should smooth things over. make them be friends. 
<ross> phoebe, you cant force kids to be friends. 
<phoebe> sure you can! give them some blocks, put them in a playpen! 
<ross> playpen?! bens seven! 
<phoebe> your kid is seven?!  hes really small.  please! please get the tickets!

<monica> i-i dont-i dont think that im gonna wear the boots tonight.

<monica> well yknow, im just-im just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. or! or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise! 
<chandler> do you think i work at some kind of boot pricing company? 
<monica> anyway, i picked up this outfit that i want to wear and the, and the boots dont really go with it. 
<chandler> you said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants! 
<monica> fine! if you want me to wear the boots, ill wear the boots. in fact, ill go into my room right now and yknow try the outfit on.

<rachel> what?! dina 
<joey>  bub!!!  i cant believe this! youre the good one! you went to college! both years! who did this to you?!

< 
<phoebe> oh, there you are ben! 
<s> aunt phoebe, what are you doing here? 
<phoebe> well, i heard youre having a problem with one of the boys in your class. and so i thought i would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. now umm, the boys name is stings son. 
<s> jack? i hate him! hes a jerk. 
<phoebe> now ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers. 
<s> i have to go. my friend doug is waiting for me over there.  
<phoebe> him youre friends with.  
<phoebe> yes! yes you can, im looking for jacks parents. 
<phoebe> uh-huh, im with ben. 
<phoebe> i am one of bens mothers. im a lesbian. it was, it was difficult coming out to my parents. 
<phoebe> oh. 
<phoebe> ah! okay so that would make me susan. problems hes having with ben?  yeah. because i really do think the parents should sit down and have a conversation. 
<phoebe> yeah! lets do that!! that-that sounds good. we should sit down and talk, just me, my lover carol, and the stings. umm, how-how will i get in touch with them? 
<phoebe> uh-huh. uh-huh. umm, could-could i get a copy of that? cause carol threw it out, she lost ours. shes such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass. 
< 
<chandler> yknow, that party wasnt bad. 
<monica> yeah! i didnt know there would be dancing. that was a fun surprise! 
<chandler> i dont see any uh, cabs. maybe we should just walk? 
<monica> oh no, we cant walk! 
<chandler> what honey, its like fifteen blocks to the subway. lets go. 
<monica> hey! do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover? 
<chandler> whats going on? 
<monica> i cant walk. okay? okay? these boots were a huge mistake! 
<chandler> what? 
<monica> okay you were right! all right, i never should have bought them! theyre killing me! one toe at a time! 
<chandler> so i was right. this is what it feels like to be right.  its oddly unsettling. 
<monica> how are we gonna get home? maybe a piggy-back ride? 
<chandler> hop on. 
<monica> okay. wait, just give me a second, i need to just get my boots off first.  ah ooh oohh ohh oh god ohh oh ohh ohhhh

<s> yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it. 
<joey> well what am i supposed to do? 
<rachel> youre supposed to realize that they are adults! and that they can make their own decisions.

<phoebe> uh-hmm. okay. well then, could we reschedule? for say, friday night perhaps at 8 oclock? concert. 
<phoebe> concert. yeah. that does put us in quite a pickle. because you see im very busy before and after the concert, and hes obviously busy during. 
<phoebe> unless! unless umm, okay i-i would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course. 
<phoebe> oh, thank you. four would be great. their son like this!

<monica> okay.  god well, we gotta go back and get them! 
<chandler> honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again? 
<monica> okay, im never gonna wear them again. i just didnt get a chance to say goodbye.

<monica> okay.  all right. 
<chandler> okay.  
<monica>  bye bootswait! half off?!

<rachel> joey, just because theyre not getting married doesnt mean this is going to be a disaster. maybe they have a plan! 
<joey> oh? oh! okay! okay! lets hear their plan! now, whats the future look like for dina and bobby? 
<s> well i really have high hopes for my band. 
<joey>  you were right. he is funny. 
<rachel> hey, now wait a minute! i get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! now come on bobby, why dont you tell us a little bit about your band? 
<s> well its just me and my pal rooster, the bands name is numb nuts. 
<rachel>  really?  
<joey> dina, if youre having a baby you should be married! even if it is to bobby!  dude, thats not a compliment! 
<s> no joey! i knew you wouldnt be supportive! 
<joey> so whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! what are you gonna do? youre gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself without a husband?! you cant be a single mother alone! youre gonna ruin your life! 
<rachel> oh excuse me! am i ruining my life?

<s> excuse me? 
<joey> one pregnant woman at a time, please! i just want you to be okay. 
<rachel> so forcing her to marry bobby is gonna make that happen? 
<joey> maybe!  well! well so-so uh, what kind of music does numb nutsoh forget it! i cant! 
<s> joey, i am scared to death about this. but i really think i can do it, im just gonna need some help. and bobbys gonna be here the whole time. 
<s> you bet i am!  and to answer your earlier question, were straight-up gangster rap.  
<s> look, rachels told me how much easier youve made all this on her. why cant you do that for me? 
<joey> because! cause cause youre my baby sister! 
<s> and youre my big brother! i mean, youre my favorite guy in the whole world. im not even scared to tell mom and dad. i was scared of telling you. 
<joey> well id be scared of them, but all right. 
<s> joey, i cant stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me. i want him to have his uncle. is my baby gonna have his uncle joey? 
<joey> of course hes gonna have his uncle joey! 
<s> were gonna be all right. i mean, even if were not married this baby is gonna be so loved. not just by us. 
<joey> thats right! by his uncle too!

<ross> yeah. 
< 
<rachel> phoebe? 
<phoebe> yeah? 
<rachel> look at that guy by the window, wow! 
<phoebe> hes awfully short and i think hes talking to himself. and to be completely honest, hes not that good in bed. 
<rachel> oh, what is wrong with me lately? i mean its like every guy i seei mean look here.  look at that guy for example, i mean normally thats not someone i would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way im feeling, all i want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack. 
<phoebe> wait a second! this is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right? 
<rachel> yeah. 
<phoebe> this is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy. 
<rachel> really?! so this has happened to you? 
<phoebe> oh absolutely yeah! oh and keep in mind, now, i was carrying triplets so in, yknow, medical terms i was-i was thrice as randy. 
<rachel> wow! this explains so much! last weekend, i went from store to store sitting on santas lap. 
<phoebe> yeah. yeah, i remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of evander holyfield from a foot locker. 
<rachel> ah. 
<phoebe> yeah. 
<rachel> well, yknow what? i go see my doctor tomorrow, ill ask her about this. maybe she can give me a pill or something.

<chandler> oh yeah. boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesnt it? 
< 
<s> hi! 
<ross> hey! 
<s> hey, i went by the photo shop, take a look, here is a mockup of our card. what do you think? 
<ross> huh. wow, this is great. 
<s> now, do you think it should say, "love ross and mona?" 
<ross> well, we-we havent said that to each other yet, but i guess its okay to say it to other people. 
<s> how many did you want? im getting a hundred. 
<ross> a hundred?! well, i-i guess ill take amona, uh i-im not sure about the whole uh, card thing. 
<s> really? why not? 
<ross> sending out a holiday card, together, i mean i just dont know if were really quite there yet. 
<s> oh yknow, i didnt think of it that way. youre right. youre right. so, can i ask you a question? 
<ross> yeah. 
<s> where are we? 
<ross> huh. 
<s> yknow, like where are we? where is this relationship going? 
<ross> hmm 
<s> i mean i love spending time with you, yknow i justi hope were moving forward. i mean, we should probably talk about that. dont you think?  
<ross> lets do the card! 
<s> what? 
<ross> the card! i think were there! 
<s> okay. ibut i think we should still have this conversation. 
<ross> really?! i mean, even with the card? 
< 
<s> hi! 
<rachel> hi! 
<s> just so you know, dr. long cant be here today, she was called to the hospital, so dr. schiff will be seeing you. 
<rachel> oh, okay. hey, can i ask you a question? was it me, or-or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? yknow who im talking about, bald haircut, hairy fingers  attractive man.) 
<rachel> yes, you are. 
<rachel> oh, really, really good. but enough about me, come on! where-where are you from? what do you do? 
<rachel> right! right! i-i actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? do you ski? or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend? 
<rachel> oh, i love to ski! how amazing is this?! 
<rachel> no. im very comfortable. 
<rachel> no! shoot, dr. schiff what kind of question is that?! 
<rachel> well would you like me to lie down on the table? 
<rachel> do you feel it too? 
< 
<rachel> hi. 
<phoebe> oh hey! so, how did your doctors appointment go? 
<rachel> well, lets see. uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam i put my pinky in his chin dimple. 
<phoebe> oh my god. 
<monica> why did you do that? 
<phoebe> okay, remember that little problem i was having during my fourth month of pregnancy? 
<monica> oh yeah, the evander holyfield phase. oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me. 
<phoebe> you wish. 
<monica> hey, i couldve had you if i wanted you. 
<phoebe> oh yeah? come and get it. 
<rachel> okay, even this is turning me on! 
<ross>  hey! 
<rachel> oh hey! hey ross! hey hows it, hows it going with you and mona? are you guys still together? 
<ross> oh yeah, yeah were moving forward. youll be getting our card! 
<monica> you and mona are doing a holiday card together? 
<ross> yeah, were not just doing a card! yknow, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going. 
<phoebe> ugh! women! 
<ross> i know! i know! why do you guys need to have this conversation?! huh? i mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, "so, where is this going?" 
<rachel> uh ross? you asked me that. 
<ross> hey! you were a closed book! okay? im not a mind reader! besides, i hate those conversations. im horrible at them. really! maybe-maybe i need kind of a gesture. yknow, something that says were moving forward without having to talk about it. 
<monica> like asking her to move in with you? 
<ross> smaller than that. 
<monica> making her a mixed tape? 
<ross> uh, bigger than that. 
<phoebe> give her a key to your apartment. 
<ross> whoa-hello! we were closer with the mixed tape. 
<monica> all right. have you said, "i love you?" you could say, i love you. 
<ross> yeah i-i dont-i dont think im quite there yet, but i could say i looove spending time with you.

<chandler> oh no-no-no!

<ross> i love you! 
<s> ohh!  and i love spending time with you.  
< 
<chandler> hi honey im home. 
<monica> from the tequila factory? 
<chandler> it was awful. to get out of going to dinner with doug i told him that you and i split up. so then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when i wouldnt give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird! 
<monica> come here. i can breath through my mouth. 
<chandler> yknow what the worse part was? i got to see what my life would be like without you. it was like its a wonderful life with lap dances. please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives. 
<monica> i promise. hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?

<joey> oh, whats wrong? 
<rachel> oh you really, you really just dont want to hear about it. 
<joey> then why did i ask? 
<rachel> okay, its justand this is really embarrassingbut lately with this whole pregnancy thing im just finding myself how do i put this umm, erotically charged. 
<joey> is that college talk for horny? 
<rachel> yeah. so yknow, i have all of these feelings and i dont know what to do about them, because i cant date like a normal person, which is fine because i dont need a relationship, i mean all i really want is one great night. just sex, yknow? no strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that i feel comfortable with and who knows what hes doing. for just one great night, i mean is that really so hard to find.  so how was your day? 
<joey> good, i uh, i saw a pretty big pigeon. 
<rachel> well, i gotta get up early and its almost seven oclock. 
<joey> yeah, i gotta, i gotta go to my room too.

<monica> you only think its stupid because you suck at it. 
<chandler> i dont suck. its sucks. you suck. 
<phoebe> wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you, then maybe i should just keep it. 
<monica> no! no-no! i love it! it is a great present! in fact, why dont you go home and wait for the thank you card? 
<chandler> why do you want to play this game so bad? 
<phoebe> yeah! its not like it spits out a clark bar after every game. 
<monica> okay. phoebe thats it. come on, get outout of the chair. get out!  oh come phoebe!

<rachel> yeah, actually thats my roommates.

<rachel> ah yes, but hes very protective of me so youd better watch yourself. 
<joey> ah hey, so this roommate of yours is he good looking? 
<rachel> hm-mmm. 
<joey> oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh? 
<rachel>  yeah, but im pretty sure hes gay. 
<joey> no-no-no-no, hes not! no! why are you trying to ruin the game? come on! 
< 
<ross> which brings us back, of course, to greelys theory of dominance.  okay, that-thats all for today. oh, uh does anyone know where the freeman building is? 
<s> yeah, its the new building on avenue a.

<rachel> i knew it! i knew it. come on tell me your moves. 
<joey> oh alright. umm, well, okay, i usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan. 
<rachel> oh my god. and that works?! 
<joey> well it does when you combine it with, "this is so embarrassing, i just want to have a normal life!" 
<rachel> oh, you poor little famous man. 
<joey> oh okay, how about this one. i was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but youre so beautiful i dont think i can. 
<rachel>  oh my god! wow! that was fantastic, i almost leaned in. i really almost did! 
<joey> alright, so so tell me one of your moves. 
<rachel> alright. so whered you grow up? 
<joey> thats your move? boy rach, youre lucky youre hot.

<joey>  queens. 
<rachel> and so were-were you close to your parents? 
<joey> yeah, with my mom. yeah, not so much with my dad. 
<rachel> why not? 
<joey> i dont know. i guess theres just always been this distance yknowi mean we both try to pretend its not there, but it is. 
<rachel>  oh.  its gotta be rough. 
<joey> yeah, it is. its really tough. yknow sometimes i thinkwow!! nice move! 
<rachel> huh? 
<joey> "whered you grow up," its so simple! 
<rachel> thank you! and now if youll excuse me, i have to go to the rest room. 
<joey> yeah.  
<rachel> and now youre watching me walk away. 
<joey> yes i am! again so simple! 
< 
<monica> hey. 
<chandler> you are not going to believe what i did today! 
<monica> well it clearly wasnt showering or shaving. 
<chandler> i got good. i played this game all day and now i rule at it! they should change the name of it to ms. chandler.  although i-i hope they dont. 
<monica> wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played ms. pac-man while i went off to work like some kind of chump?! 
<chandler> uh-huh, and i got all the top ten scores, i erased phoebe off the board! high five!  
<monica> what is the matter with your hand? 
<chandler> well ive been playing it for like eight hours, itll loosen up. come on, check out the scores. oh, and also look at the initials, theyre dirty words. 
<monica> chandler, why would you do that? 
<chandler> because its awesome. 
<monica> you think this is clever? 
<chandler> well yknow, they only give you three letters, so after a-s-s it is a bit of a challenge. 
<monica> hey wait a minute, this one isnt dirty. 
<chandler> it is when you put it together with that one. 
<monica> ah, well if you dont clear this off, you wont be getting one of those from me. but bens coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this cant be there. 
<chandler> come on, he wont even know what they mean. 
<monica> chandler! hes seven; hes not stupid. 
<chandler> have you talked to him lately? 
<monica> all right, look im just gonna unplug it. 
<chandler> no-no-no, if you unplug it, ill have nothing to show for my day! it would be like i was at work.  no!  hey look at that! look at that, its still there! this thing must have some kind of primitive rom  chip in it or something! 
<monica> honey you-you got to beat your scores! 
<chandler> with the claw?! 
<monica> all right fine. fine, ill do it. ive just got to get this off the screen. carol and susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger. 
<chandler>  pull my fingermy hand is messed up. 
< 
<rachel> i am not gonna answer that! 
<joey> oh come on! just pick one! between monica, phoebe, chandler, and ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch? 
<rachel> no one! they are my friends, i wouldnt punch any of them. 
<joey> chandler? 
<rachel> yeah, but i dont know why. look at me, im having such a wonderful time! 
<joey> me too! hey rach, can i just say i think this is the best date i ever had! 
<rachel> i know! 
<joey> i never laughed so harddid you see the wine come out of my nose? 
<rachel> joey, i think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose. 
<joey> i gotta say, i never knew i could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much. 
<rachel> well that is because you have never been on a date with me before. 
<joey> huh. huh. 
<rachel> all right, now dont judge me. i normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. im ripping into this swan. 
<joey> ah! okay, well then you dont judge me. im gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie i had before.  
<rachel> so tell me, what are joey tribbianis end of the night moves? 
<joey> ah, well, if i want the girl to kiss me, first thing i do is make my lips look irresistible. 
<rachel> how do you do that? 
<joey> now you cant tell anyone, but uh i put on shiny lip balm. 
<rachel> oh my god! 
<joey> yeah, like a moth to a flame, im telling ya. okay all right, so now you go. 
<rachel> no, i dont want to tell you. 
<joey> why not? 
<rachel> because its embarrassing. 
<joey> more embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?!  i didnt say raspberry before did i? all right just-just tell me rach, just tell me! 
<rachel>  okay. all right, stand up.  well, when were at the door, i lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then i make this sound, "hmmm." okay, i know it doesnt sound like anything, but i swear it works. 
<joey>  yeah. whyyeah, that would work for ya 
<rachel> all right, i gotta go to bed. honey, i had such a wonderful time. 
<joey> oh.  yeah.  me to.  commercial break 
< 
<rachel> you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?! 
<ross> no, i ran. it was really far, and when did people stop understanding the phrase, "get the hell out of my way!" 
<rachel> well, why didnt you just take a cab? 
<ross> ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets itll take me twice as long. besides, i teach the class three times a week, who am i? rockefeller?

<monica> i just had the most amazing bath. 
<chandler> really? i dont like baths. 
<monica> wait, you like them with me. 
<chandler> honey, its not the bath i enjoy, its the wet, naked lady. 
<monica> oh, baths are so relaxing! 
<chandler> really? what do you do? you just sit in there stewing in your own filth. 
<monica> how dirty do you think i am? im telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! it would take all of your stress away. 
<chandler> honey, its on a wednesday and im watching road rules, how stressed do you think i am? 
<joey>  hey, chandler, you got a minute? i-i really need to talk to you. 
<chandler> oh! uh, yeah! is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk? 
<joey> well, neither. 
<chandler> oh my god, whats up?! 
<joey> i dont know. its-its just lately, ive been feeling okay, heres what it is  you know what? i feel a lot better, thanks!  
<chandler> oh no-no, no you dont, just come back. 
<joey> all right. okay. you and monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to london. oh, no, but thats different. i mean, there are rules there, too! you know what i mean? 
<chandler> do you? 
<joey> it was different for you guys! i mean, i mean, you were both in the same place, right? 
<chandler> in london? 
<joey> yeah. 
<chandler> yes. when monica and i were in london, we were both in london. 
<joey> you know what? this is a bad idea. forget it. forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me. 
<chandler> if that. 
< 
<rachel> hi! oh, ross, dont forget, we have that doctors appointment tomorrow! 
<ross> right. 
<phoebe> hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby? 
<ross> no-no, we talked about it. we dont want to know. all we care about is that its happy and healthy. 
<rachel> yep! happy and healthy! and cute! 
<ross> and smart! 
<rachel> popular. 
<ross> with an aptitude for science. 
<phoebe> are you two talking about the same baby? hey! have you started off thinking of names yet? 
<rachel> oh yeah! ive come up with a bunch of ideas! 
<ross> really? me too! 
<phoebe> me too! 
<rachel> really?! 
<phoebe> uh huh! if its a girl, phoebe, and if its a boy, phoebo! 
<ross> maybe. but it wouldnt hurt to have a backup, you know? uh, rach-rach, what were you thinking?  
<rachel> okay! i was thinking if its a girl, how about sandrine? its french. 
<ross> huh. thats a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent. 
<rachel> okay fine, what do you have? 
<ross> well, ok, its for a boy. well, i know its a little out there, but darwin. 
<rachel> wow, oh my god, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard. 
<phoebe> yeah, by sandrine. 
<ross> youre just saying that 'cause i said no to your name! 
<rachel> im really, really not. 
<phoebe> how-how about you each get five vetoes? 
<ross> all right. 
<rachel> all right. 
<ross> that sounds fair. 
<rachel> yeah! i dont think youre going to need it though. okay, check this out. if its a girl, rain. 
<ross> veto. 
<rachel> why? 
<ross> rain? hi. hi, my name is rain. i have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat. 
<phoebe> i know her! i bought homemade soap from her at a dead show! 
<ross> okay, how about, for a guy, thatcher? 
<rachel> ross, why do you hate our child? 
<ross> fine, you go. 
<rachel> okay, james. 
<ross> huh. 
<rachel> but only if its a girl. 
<ross> oh, veto. how aboutooh, i like ruth! what about ruth? 
<rachel> oh! im sorry! are we having an 89-year-old? how about dayton? 
<ross> veto. stewart? 
<rachel> veto. sawyer? 
<ross> veto. helen? 
<rachel> veto. 
<phoebe> is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good? 
< 
<chandler> hey. 
<monica> boy, do i have a surprise for you! 
<chandler> sex on the balcony? 
<monica> no, but someones really not going to get over that idea, are they? 
<chandler> what is it? 
<monica> i drew you a bath! 
<chandler> honey, i dont like baths! could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony? 
<monica> please, could you just try it for me? come on, i used all my best stuff! i-i-i lit some candles. i put on some music. i used bath salts, plus bubble bath! and got you this little plastic navy ship. so its a boy bath! 
<chandler> well, this does butch it up a bit. 
<monica> i swear, if you try it, you will love it! 
<chandler> all right, if i do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony? 
<monica> absolutely.  
<monica> bet i know how that discussions going to go.  
<chandler>  all right, this isnt so bad. i like the flower smell! which is okay, because ive got my boat. 
<monica>  so? 
<chandler> oh my god. 
<monica> i told you you were a bath person! hey, when you get out, maybe i can give you a facial! 
<chandler> im going to need a bigger boat. 
< 
<ross> i dont think you had an open mind about the name ruth. i mean, come on, little ruthie geller, how-how cute is that? 
<rachel> oh, oh my god! i can practically hear the mahjong tiles! the sex of the baby? 
<ross> uh, no. no, were not. 
<rachel> but you have it right there in that file? you could tell us whether its a boy or a girl? dayton or sandrine? phoebe or phoebo? 
<ross> no, no, we want to wait, right? 
<rachel> right. right. its really not my place, but please dont name your child phoebo. 
<rachel>  so, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest? 
<ross> what? rach! come on, thats terrible! theyre uh theyre babies. theyre-theyre all beautiful. 
<rachel> third one from the left? 
<ross> yeah, why is it staring at me? i think it knows im talking about it.  dont-dont youwhwhahey!! 
<rachel> what?! 
<ross> youre looking! 
<rachel> i didnt! 
<ross> i saw you! 
<rachel> okay fine, i did. but i didnt see anything, i swear. 
<ross> shame on you! ugly baby judges you! 
<rachel> okay, but ross just listen to me 
<ross> no, no, no, no! dont tell me! i dont want to know! 
<rachel> but i couldnt even if i wanted to, because i dont know! i swear; i didnt see anything, and i dont want to know! it was just a momentary lapse. 
<ross> momentary lapse. dont-dont you have any self-control? 
<rachel>  okay, a couple months late on the lecture, ross. 
< 
<monica> hello? 
<chandler> im in the bathroom, can you come in here? i think theres something wrong. 
<monica> you know what? i-i think ill wait out here. 
<chandler> im in the bathtub. 
<monica> oh.  whats wrong? 
<chandler> i drew my own bath, but i did it wrong! the waters tepid. the salt didnt dissolve and is now lodged places. and the scents i used dont compliment each other. eucalyptus and chamomileoh! 
<monica> what? 
<chandler> the bath salts! theyre starting to effervesce! its different.  its interesting. 
<monica> okay, lets talk about something else. 
<chandler> yeah! sure, sure. so, what was going on with you today? oh-oh-oh! 
<monica> well, i actually had the weirdest conversation with joey. he was talking about rules and right and wrong and 
<chandler> i had the exact same conversation. 
<monica> you did? what was he talking about? 
<chandler> i dont know! joey hasnt had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in macbeth! 
<monica>  that was a long night. 
<chandler> all right, lets break this down. what exactly did he say to you? 
<monica> okay, he was talking about rules. 
<chandler> uh-huh. 
<monica> umm, and looking at people differently. 
<chandler> he didnt say anything about that to me. 
<monica> what did he tell you? 
<chandler> he was asking all these questions about you, me, and london. and, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules. 
<monica> okay. so you, me and london. looking at people differently. maybe he wants to do what you and i did in london with someone. 
<chandler> but what did he mean by rules? 
<monica> wait a minute! he stopped talking the minute phoebe came in! 
<chandler> because he was looking at her differently. 
<monica> and phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules! 
<chandler> my god! he wants to do it with phoebe in london! 
<phoebe>  you guys? 
<monica> just a minute!  thats mrs. tribbiani! 
<chandler> you dont say anything. 
<monica> why would i say anything? that two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! and they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies? 
<chandler> im not going to let you say anything. 
<monica> you just stay here!  
<chandler> oh, god!  
<phoebe> oh, hey, monica, i brought back your iron. 
<monica> oh, you had that? 
<phoebe> uh-huh. 
<monica> i thought i lost it. i got a new one, like, a month ago. 
<phoebe> oh, just as well, i broke this one.  
<phoebe> what? 
<monica> nothing. 
<phoebe> okay. 
<monica> i mean, i-i, i really shouldnt say. i mean, im really not supposed to. 
<phoebe> fine. 
<monica> its a humdinger! 
<phoebe> then its really too bad that you cant tell me. 
<monica> somebody likes you! 
<phoebe>  is it chandler? 
<monica> no! 
<phoebe> well, then tell him to stop staring! 
<monica> its joey! 
<phoebe> really?! joey?! you dont say. 
<monica> is it something youd be interested in? 
<phoebe> i dont know, i dont know, i dont know. you know, i mean, on the one hand, mother may i? but yknow on the other hand no. no, i cant. were friends. no, oh, no. i dont want to risk what we have. 
<monica> i guess that makes sense. so, you think youre going to talk to him? 
<phoebe> sure, yeah. i mean, its joey. i dont want him to get hurt. well, i must say, i am on fire! first chandler, now joey! 
<monica> not chandler, just joey. 
<phoebe> sure. commercial break 
< 
<rachel> hey. 
<ross> hey. 
<rachel> you know what? ive been thinking about it. im really coming around on the name ruth. i think i would actually consider naming our child that. 
<ross> rach, i-i cant tell you how-how much that means to me! ohh wait a minute. wait a minute. you-you hated the name ruth! why-why would you change your mind? unless, you know were never going to have to use it. you did see the folder. you know its a boy! 
<rachel> i didnt see anything! i actually changed my mind about the name. 
<ross> i dont think so! youre just giving me ruth so youll get to name it when its a boy, and thats when youll swoop in and name him heath or blaine or sequoia. 
<rachel> i wouldsequoia? 
<ross> veto. 
<rachel> fine. 
<ross> unless  you anticipated that i would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named ruth! well, im not falling for that! okay? ruth is off the table! 
<rachel> but ross, you want the name ruth! 
<ross> not like this! 
< 
<phoebe> hey. 
<joey> hey. well, whats up? 
<phoebe> umm, joey, i know. 
<joey> what? 
<phoebe> i knooow. 
<joey> whaaat? 
<phoebe> i know about your feelings. 
<joey> oh my god. you do? 
<phoebe> yes, and im sorry. i-i know things worked out for chandler and monica, but thats very rare. 
<joey> i know. i know. and this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. i mean, its rachel for god sakes. 
<phoebe> for god sakes, its rachel! 
<joey> i know. i know. and shes not only my friend; shes my pregnant friend! shes my pregnant friend whos ross ex! 
<phoebe> yeah thats rachel.  beat me over the head with it. 
<joey> what am i going to do? you know, and i keep, i keep trying to get rid of these feelings, yknow? i stayed up all last night and made a list of everything i dont like about her. you want to hear it? 
<phoebe> yeah. 
<joey> she made me switch to light mayo. thats it! thats all i got! and, you know what? it tastes the same and my pants fit better! 
<phoebe> joey, i just think youre getting worked up over nothing. this is probably just a crush. 
<joey> you think? 
<phoebe> absolutely! yknow, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away. 
<joey> yeah, just a crush! thats all this is! its a crush! im joey; i dont get deep feelings. 
<phoebe> thats right, there you go! crushes happen all the time! i know ive had them for all you guys. well, except for ross and chandler. and im sure youve had them for us. 
<joey> not really. 
<phoebe> mm-hmm.  throw me a bone here. 
< 
<ross> so, i uh i called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby. 
<rachel> what? 
<ross> thats right. the student has become the master. 
<rachel> ross, i swear, i dont know. 
<ross> oh, come on, you know its a girl! 
<rachel> a what?! 
<ross> you really didnt know? 
<rachel> were having a girl? 
<ross> no. 
<rachel> thats what you just said! 
<ross> no. 
<rachel> you said girl! 
<ross> yes. im im sorry. im so sorry. 
<rachel> im not! were having a girl! sometimes i cant believe its with youbut still! were having a girl! 
<ross> i know! i know. you know what? im putting ruth back on the table! 
<rachel> oh, yes! well have ourselves a little baby ruth 
<ross> permission to veto.

<monica> hey. 
<chandler> do i smell essential oils? 
<monica> yeah, im going to take a bath. im just going to get a magazine. 
<chandler> okay.  
<monica> what do you think youre doing? 
<chandler> l-leaving my troubles behind? 
<monica> i know that youre new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum. 
<chandler> oh, its so hard to care when youre this relaxed. 
<monica> fine, you can have the bath, but i am taking your boat. now youre just a girl in a tub!  
<chandler>  hey!

<chandler>  you told her?! 
<monica> she pulled it out of me! shes like a conversational wizard! howd it go? 
<phoebe> well, you were wrong, he doesnt like me! 
<monica> what? 
<phoebe> yeah! how would you like it if i sent you to lee majors house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didnt like you? how would you feel? 
<monica>  i dont think id care. 
<phoebe> really? lee majors is hot! 
<joey>  hello? 
<phoebe> were in the bathroom! 
<joey> why? 
<chandler>  because its a relaxing and enjoyable time! 
<joey>  what are you guys doing in here? 
<monica> oh my god! a friend hes looking at differently, but its wrong. its rachel! 
<chandler> you like rachel?! 
<joey> its no big deal, okay? phoebe and i talked about it. its just a crush! its going to go away!  dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles! oh!

<joey> why not? 
<chandler> i dont know! what could she possibly be hiding in here that i cant see?! 
<joey> i dont know. ooh, i bet its richard. 
<chandler> why would monica be keeping richard in here? 
<joey> well off the top of my head uhh, maybe shes having her cake and eating it too. you being the cake and richard being the too. or! 
<chandler> and here we go 
<joey> i saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. yknow it wouldnt kill ya to respect your wifes privacy!  stupid closet full of bugs! 
<rachel> joey. joey, something feels weird and not good weird. i dontwhoa!!

<joey>  oh hey-hey! 
<ross>  is everything okay? 
<rachel> yeah, everythings fine! 
<ross> your page said come to the hospital, what? what was it? what happened? 
<joey> something called braxton-hicks contractions. 
<ross> oh. oh. thank god, most women dont even feel them. 
<rachel> okay, no uterus, no opinion. 
<joey> hey uh, whats with the candy? 
<ross> oh when you beeped me i was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater. 
<rachel> oh you went to the movies by yourself? 
<ross> no imona!

<ross> what? why? whats wrong? 
<rachel> no, everythings fine. i just gotta go back 
<ross> no really, you tell me whats up. 
<rachel> i-i forgot my underwear.  
<ross>  so, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital. 
<joey> oh hey, dont worry about it man. dont worry about it, no big deal. 
<ross> yeah but still, i mean it shouldve been me. im the dad. on braxton-hicks.  oh and by the way, you did the right thing by bringing her in. youre gonna make a wonderful father. 
<joey> oh uh, hey. not as good as this guy!  he brought twizlers! commercial break

<chandler> there has got to be a way! 
<joey> easy there captain kirk. oh, do you have a bobby pin? 
<chandler> yeah.  oh no wait, im not an nine-year-old girl. 
<joey> then why do you throw like one? 
<chandler> maybe monica has a bobby pin. 
<joey> sure. "monica." 
<chandler> so, hows the hideously inappropriate crush on rachel coming? 
<joey> uh, really good. really good. yeah, i should be ready to kill myself any day now.  wow, you sure found that quick.  i justi wish i didnt feel this way about rachel anymore, yknow? i wish things could go back to normal. i mean, i love living with her and god, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now i think i think ross feels left out. yknow? when i had to take rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought i was the father. god you shouldve seen the look on rosss face.  by the way, i have no idea what im doing here. for all i know im just locking it more. oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card? 
<chandler> thats a good idea. 
<joey> yeah. 
<chandler> okay.  so uh, ross is kinda bummed huh? 
<joey> oh, i just i feel terrible. 
<chandler> well, its not your fault. what are you gonna do? not take her to the hospital? yknow? youre doing nothing wrong.  except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby.  richard? if-if youre in there, could you pass me my credit card? 
< 
<monica> hey. 
<phoebe> hey. 
<monica> i gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. that massage felt so good!

<phoebe> 600. 
<monica> whats going on? 
<phoebe> oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged! 
<monica> what?  
<phoebe> yeah, and it really freaked me out! and after a while i even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on. 
<monica> what?! youre crazy! theres nothing sexual about the noises i make! 
<phoebe> really? theres nothing sexual about this?  oooh. oo god! ohh. ohhhh. ohh.  what are you looking at?!  i mean hi. 
<monica> oh mythis is so embarrassing. oh my god, im never gonna get massaged again! 
<phoebe> no, you cant let this stop you from getting massages! no look, i have, i have lots of clients that make the same noises you do! 
<monica> really?! 
<phoebe> well not clients, lovers. but lets just yknow, try it again. come back and-and well work through it. 
<monica> are you sure? 
<phoebe> yes. 
<monica> i guess. 
<phoebe> great! okay, if youll just excuse me.  so, did you hear something you liked?

<ross> well yeah! 
<rachel> oh ross!!  
<ross> what?! what?! rach what?! 
<joey> whats going on? 
<ross> i made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles. 
<joey> pickle? pickles make her sick. giving her pickles is like giving me salad. 
<ross>  i-im sorry rach, i didnt know. are you gonna be okay? 
<rachel> yeah, ill be fine. but could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when i get out there? 
<joey> im on it!  
<ross> i cant believe this! i shouldnt be the one making her throw up! 
<joey> dude relax! it could happen to anyone. 
<ross> yeah? not to you, because you know this stuff. i dont know any of it and im the father. i wish id be more involved yknow. 
<rachel>  well, if anyone is keeping score, i no longer eat tuna. 
<joey> hey uh, can i, can i talk to you guys for a second? 
<ross> yeah. 
<rachel> whats up? 
<joey> uh, sit down. i wanna talk about our situation. 
<rachel>  are you breaking up with us? 
<joey> the thing is cause i live with rachel im here for a lot of the stuff, okay?  and ross ross is missing everything. so 
<rachel> yeah? 
<joey> maybe you two should live together. 
<rachel> are you asking me to move out? do you not want me here? 
<joey> oh no-no, no-no i love living with you. it just seems that if youre gonna have a roommate, yknow it might as well be the father. 
<rachel> but joey, i dont think ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. i meanor he does. 
<ross> no i-i-i would love to be around for you and the baby. and we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis. 
<rachel> but ross, its you and me! 
<ross> so? sure! but it-it wouldnt be anything romantic. and im-im dating monadamnit mona! i was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! what is wrong with me?! 
<joey> all right now, so? what do you think?

<chandler> hey. 
<joey> hey. 
<chandler> so rachels all moved out huh? how are you taking it? 
<joey> well uh, i wanted to have a few beers, but uh, i got rid of those because rachel couldnt stand the smell of them. but i have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. and uh, its a couple weeks past its expiration date, so its got a bit of a kick. 
<chandler> are you okay? 
<joey> are you kidding me? im great! yeah, im uh; im better than great. i am good. and now that shes gone, i can uh, i can do all this stuff around here that i couldnt do before. yknow? like umm, i can walk around naked again. yknow? i can uh, i can watch porn in the living room. right? this is uh, this is good for me. yknow? i like being on my own, im uh, better off this way. im uh, a lone wolf. yknow? a loner. alone. all alone. forever. whats a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?!  closing credits

<ross> you dont want my opinion? 
<monica> not really. 
<ross> come on, im your older brother, ask me! 
<monica> all right, big brother.  which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your best friend would want to do her? 
<ross>  the red one.

<phoebe>  hey. look, i know youve been really depressed lately, so i brought someone over to cheer you up. right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate. 
<joey> no, im not sleeping with your friend jane again.  
<phoebe> he-hee! 
<joey> hey! a dog! hi! who, you got to admit, looks a lot like jane.

<joey>  cmere. hey. cmere. thats rachel. shes the one who used to live here. might as well be honest with youwe love her. but we cant have her. i really miss her. well, hey, you understand, right? youre a guy.  well, you used to be. 
< 
<monica>  so what do you think?   
<monica>  ive still got it! 
<chandler>  why did you get me this? 
<monica> what is it? 
<chandler> its yelling bleeding dilating. oh, the dilating 
<monica> is this the video of the baby being born? sweetie, this is phoebes. why were you even watching it? 
<chandler> i thought maybe you got me porn for valentines day. 
<monica> chandler, if you thought i was going to get you porn for valentines day  you were right! apparently, its about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! yeah, it got four starts!  oh, wait a minute. those arent stars. anyway, you want to take a look? 
<chandler> well, im not really in a sexy mood right now. 
<monica> honey, whats going on? 
<chandler> well, remember the first time we saw jaws? 
<monica> mm-hmm. 
<chandler> how long it took to go back in the water? 
<monica> chandler, we cant let this tape wreck valentines day! 
<chandler> you dont know. you didnt see it. 
<monica> child-birth, its a natural thing! its beautiful. 
<chandler> oh, beautiful? really? beautiful? you think this is beautiful?  
<monica> oh! oh, my god! no wonder my mother hates me! 
<chandler> see, honey, theres 
<monica> dont touch me!

<s> hi! 
<ross> hey!  so, how was atlantic city? 
<s> good. 
<ross> yeah? 
<s> i brought you back a present. 
<ross> wha? oh, come on. you didnt have tosaltwater taffy?!  thanks! this is interesting. you know, most people think this is made with sea water, but its actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. thats not interesting. 
<s> i think its interesting. 
<ross> i do too! i missed you! 
<s> i missed you, too! so, how was your week? 
<ross> oh, it was good! it was good. actually, the baby started kicking! 
<s> how exciting! 
<ross> yeah! i know! it was. oh the only sad thing is i wasnt around when it happened for the first time. 
<s> oh no. 
<ross> yeah, im missing out on all this other stuff, too. so, joey suggested rachel move in with me. 
<s>  yeah right! 
<ross> what? 
<s> joey cracks me up! its like, yeah, why dont you have your ex-wife move in with you? that wouldnt be awkward at all!  
<ross>  huh uh-huh. 
<s> huh, could you imagine. i go away for a few days, and come back, and my boyfriend is living with some woman he got pregnant!   
<s> so, whatd you tell him? 
<ross>  just a second!  commercial break 
< 
<phoebe> how could you not tell mona that rachel is living with you? 
<ross> i dont know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy! 
<phoebe> taffy, really? ive never had any. 
<ross> ever?! 
<phoebe> well, i think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.  thank you! so what, youre just never going to tell her? 
<ross> oh, no, no, no, i will! i just want to butter her up, first! you know, im going to take her to an amazing valentines dinner. do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks im the best boyfriend in the world, then im going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me. 
<phoebe> if i havent said it before are you going towhat the mother of crap is up with this stuff?  oh, god. is it gum, is it food? whats the deal?  oh, its nice! may i try a pink one? 
< 
<joey> so, between her and me being friends, and her history with ross, it just isnt going to happen. it would be like you falling in love with a cat. 
<phoebe>  hey! 
<joey> hey. 
<phoebe> hey, buddy. hows my favorite dog, huh? hows my favorite dog?  youre subdued.  did you give him a beer? 
<joey> no. 
<phoebe> will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment. 
<joey> yeah, sure. go ahead.  oh, me, right!  
<phoebe> hes miserable! what happened to him? 
<joey> nothing. we just talked about stuff. 
<phoebe> what stuff? 
<joey> rachel stuff. 
<phoebe> oh joey, you bummed him out! this was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him! 
<joey> hes breathing! 
<phoebe> okay, im going to take him back to wendys. 
<joey> no, no, no, no! hes fine! look, look, look!  heres your ball! get your ball! get your ball!  get your ball! my god, what have i done to you, huh? i broke the dog! pheebs, i broke the dog!

<ross> well, im, uh, going to pick up mona. what have you got going tonight? 
<rachel> oh, ive got big valentines plans! ive got my chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy! 
<ross> yknow, its interesting! most people think thats made with seawater, when in fact 
<rachel> ross, we actually watched the documentary together.  
<rachel> ooh! my chinese food! let me get my cash!  
<ross>  mona? what arehi! what are you doing here? im, um, supposed to pick you up! 
<s> change of plans, i made you a special valentines dinner! surprise! 
<ross> ayyyayyyy! 
<rachel>  oh, hey, mona! 
<s> hi! hi. hi, rachel!  whats she doing here? 
<ross> i have no idea! 
<rachel> ill be watching tv if anybody needs me.  
<s> seriously, what is she doing? 
<ross> uh lately, she just likes hanging out here. 
<s> why? 
<ross> i think shes lonely. 
<s> okay, but its valentines day! 
<ross> i know. 
<s> cant we just ask her to go? 
<ross> no, no. shes way to emotional. and by emotional i mean crazy.  
<rachel> im not here! thats just my chinese food! 
<s> oh, my god! she has food delivered here? 
<ross> mm-hmm. shesshes emotional, but, but ballsy. 
<rachel> you know what im going to do? im going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed!  
<ross> and you thought she was going to be in our way! so, why dont you, uh, open the champagne, and ill be right back. ive got a surprise for you. 
<s> you got another ex-wife back there? 
<ross>  please start drinking!  
<rachel>  im just going to grab the phone. 
<s> oh, rachel! wait! hey, i hope you dont take this the wrong way, but, but, um what are you doing? 
<rachel> oh, im sorry! do you need the phone? 
<s> no, no. listen, ross is too nice to say anything, but this is his apartment, and, and, we gotta have some boundaries, so why dont you go back to your place and give us some privacy? 
<rachel>  but, but, mona, i live here. 
<ross>  happy valentines day! or something to remember me by. 
< 
<monica> how long has it been this time? 
<chandler> 90 seconds. 
<monica> thats better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it except all i did was think about it. 
<chandler> you know, it haunts me? up til now, the worst thing i ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. after this, i would gladly make that my screensaver! 
<monica> okay, well, we have to get past this! why dont we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed? 
<chandler> i can do that. 
<monica> okay.  
<chandler> okay. now all weve got to do is get rid of this chair.  
<monica> oh, thank god! 
<chandler> oh, i know! 
<monica> come in! 
<rachel>  hi! im so sorry to barge in on your valentines, but i had to get away from all the yelling. mona is dumping ross. 
<monica> oh, my god. 
<chandler> poor ross.  
<chandler> oh, great. we have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes! 
<monica> rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? its here. 
<chandler> oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it 
<rachel> why? you saw it? is it scary? 
<chandler> well, lets just say its ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself. 
<rachel> well, now, wait. now im all freaked out. come on, you guys will watch it with me. 
<monica> no, but i will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you! 
<rachel> cmon, seriously, you guys, youre not going to make me watch this alone! 
<monica> shes right of course not. honey, get the tape. 
<chandler>  this reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.  okay, here we go. 
<rachel> okay.  ooh, my!  woah! why is that baby torturing that woman?! 
<chandler> why have i seen this thing three times?! 
<monica> its still beautiful. 
<rachel> uh! its horrible! 
<monica> i know! i know, im so sorry for you! 
<rachel> oh, my god!  
<chandler> wait, you guys, look! 
<rachel> what? did her ass explode?! 
<chandler> no, the babys out! look, look! 
<monica> oh, look at those little fingers and toes! 
<chandler> and look how happy the mom is now! 
<monica> oh rach! 
<rachel> oh, screw you guys, you dont have to do it! 
< 
<ross> hey, hey, man! 
<joey> hey, whats up? 
<ross> uh mona just dumped me. 
<joey> oh, man, im sorry. why? 
<ross> well, with everything thats been going on lately, i havent exactly been the perfect boyfriend. you know, i, uh, i didnt tell her i got rachel pregnant. i gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! and then i lied to her about rachel moving in with me. in a way, i actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know? 
<joey> still, that really sucks, man. especially on valentines day. 
<ross> yeah. wait a minute. what are you doing here? joey tribbiani without a date on valentines day? whats going on, huh? girl trouble? 
<joey> sort of. 
<ross> really?! 
<joey> you dont have to seem so happy about it. 
<ross> oh, sorry. well, look, maybe i can help you with it. 
<joey> oh, i i d 
<ross> hey, whatever it is, i am sure it has happened to me. yknow, actually onceonce i got dumped during sex.  
<ross> anyway, so, uh, so what is it? 
<joey> forget about it. its no big deal. 
<ross> cmon! joey! what is it? 
<joey> its nothing. 
<ross> hey, hey, its me. why cant you tell me? 
<joey> okay, uh sit down.  um theres this woman that i like. a lot. but, uh it cant happen. 
<ross> shes not a tribbiani? 
<joey> no! 
<ross> i knew it. so, is she someone from work? 
<joey> yes. 
<ross> well, uh, does she like you? 
<joey> sometimes i think maybe she could. but it doesnt matter, because i cant do anything about it. 
<ross> why not? 
<joey> well, its complicated. shes with this other guy. for a long time. someone from work, too. and i could never do that to the guy, because were really good friends. 
<ross> so, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh is he still in love with her? 
<joey> no. i dont think so. 
<ross> okay. um is he a good guy? 
<joey> yeah, hes the best. 
<ross> then talk to him! he might be fine with it. 
<joey> oh, i dont know. 
<ross> joey, its worth finding out. i mean, if you really like her. 
<joey> i do! so much! i cant stop thinking about her! i cant sleep, i 
<ross> okay, joey, you know what? you have to go for it. how often does this happen to you, huh? you owe it to yourself. 
<s>  heres your warm milk. 
<ross> im going to uh im going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home. 
<joey> oh, yeah. 
<ross> anyway seriously, uh just just talk to the guy, okay? and tell me how it goes.  
<joey> its rachel.  closing credits

<joey> look no, i-i know its bad, and i know its wrong. okay? but-but its not like anythings ever gonna happen. yknow? these-these are just feelings, theyre gonna go away.

<s> rachel?!! opening credits 
< 
<rachel> oh-oh! okay, shes kicking! 
<chandler> oh!  shes growing inside you. 
<rachel> whoa!! 
<chandler> oh!  
<rachel> wow that was a big one. 
<chandler> i think thats the youngest girl ever to reject me. 
<phoebe>  oh hey you guys! 
<chandler> oh hey! 
<rachel> hi! 
<phoebe> hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates? 
<rachel> oh yes i do. i do. i believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. and do you know how you find him? you stop looking for him. thats why i stopped looking for russell crowe. hell find me. 
<phoebe> uh-huh,  and you? 
<chandler> no. i mean i believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and i believe in falling in love, but soul mates, i dont think they exist. 
<phoebe> okay, good. 
<chandler> why? 
<phoebe> well last night, i met monicas. 
<chandler> what? 
<phoebe> yeah, i had a date with this guy, and i swear to god, he is her other half. 
<chandler> come on, dont be crazy.  you dont think theres someone out there better suited for monica than me, do ya?  
<rachel>  well, whats he like?! 
<phoebe> well hes tall. 
<rachel> uh-huh. 
<phoebe> he has brown hair. 
<rachel> of course, of course. 
<chandler> a tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe! 
<phoebe> he works with food! 
<rachel> oh sure. older? 
<phoebe> obviously, and hes british. 
<rachel> oh, i was just gonna ask! 
<phoebe> yeah? and, hes-hes so centered and mature and confident. 
<rachel> oh, its so sad they never had a chance to meet. 
<chandler> luckily, the guy she settled for cant hear what youre talking about. 
<phoebe> oh, im so sorry. um, and maybe im wrong! i butyknow im gonna go out with him again, ill find out more. 
<chandler> you believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youre still gonna date him? 
<phoebe> well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girls gotta eat. 
< 
<monica> hey. 
<ross> hey. 
<monica> i just talked to joey, i justi want to see how you were. 
<ross> oh yknow, i stilli cant believe it. joey and rachel i mean its its like you and me going out, only weirder! 
<monica> all right, i know youre hurting, and-and i want to be supportive, but dont say that again. 
<ross> oh my god! what if, what if they get married? then hed be the stepfather of my child. 
<monica> honey, i dont think thats something we need to worry about! first of all hes-hes never gonna tell her how he feels about her. and even if he did you have no idea how shed react. 
<ross> sure, because women never like joey. yknow, i think hes a virgin. 
<monica> joey hes not even thinking about going after rachel! 
<ross> hes not? 
<monica> no! all hes thinking about is how youre taking this! i mean, listen its totally freaking him out. hes talking about moving to vermont. 
<ross> why? 
<monica> he says he wants to leave the country.  he thinks you hate him. 
<ross> hate him? i no, i dont hate him.  its just its rachel, yknow? 
<monica> honey i cant even imagine how hard this must be for you. but, i dont want you to lose joey over it. and right now he just needs to know that youre still his friend. 
<ross> okay. okay, ill talk to him. 
<monica> all right. now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into vermont money. 
< 
<phoebe> oh! hi! 
<monica> hi! 
<phoebe> umm, chandler, monica, this is don. 
<s> oh, hello.  hello.  
<phoebe>  soul mate. 
<chandler>  what? 
<phoebe>  soul mate. 
<monica> so, what have you guys been doing? 
<s> well, we just had a terrible lunch today at reattica. what is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place? 
<monica> i know! what is this, 1985?! 
<s> thats exactly what i said. phoebe, isnt that strange. 
<monica> not really. 
<chandler> whats wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?  on a barbecue chicken pizza?  no? 
<monica> so don, what-what other restaurants do you like? 
<s> well, octavio, 27&7oh! and theres this great little place, alessandros. 
<monica> oh my god! thats my restaurant, im the chef there. 
<s> youre kidding me! 
<monica> no! 
<s> your food is fantastic! wow, i really want to talk to you about your menu, once i get some coffees first. um, anyone want any? 
<monica> oh, id like a latte. oh yknow what? if youre gonna talk about me, im gonna go with you.  
<chandler> what are you doing?! 
<phoebe> nothing! i swear to god i didnt know you guys would be here! and the good news is you didnt believe in soul mates. so 
<chandler> i believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife! 
<phoebe> theyre just talking, and yknow what? just because i think theyre soul mates doesnt mean anythings gonna happen. 
<monica>  phoebe, good work. 
<phoebe> yeah? 
<monica> yeah! oh hes great, i love him.  
<phoebe> dont worry, well find you someone else. 
< 
<joey> hey. 
<ross> hey. 
<joey> look, i understand if you came by to hit me, i deserve it. 
<ross> no, i dont want to hit you. 
<joey> oh what then? kick me? 
<ross> no. 
<joey>  bite me? 
<ross> no, no i dont want to do anything to you. all right? i just want to tell you that im not mad at you and and that i certainly do not hate you. i just, i just came here to say that.  
<joey> oh nowhey ross-ross! do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something? 
<ross> uh yeah sure.  
<joey> do uh, do you got any beer? all-all i got is this melon stuff that rachel left. i dont 
<ross> okay. 
<joey>  hey look ross, you need to understand something okay? i uh i am never gonna act on this rachel thing, okay? i-i would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you.  
<ross> thank you.  
<joey> anyway, it uh look itll just take me a while to get over her, thats all. im not even sure how to do that, i mean ive never been in love before so 
<ross> what?! youre in love with her. 
<joey> yeah, i thought you knew that. 
<ross> umm, no. 
<joey> wow. hey look, if it helps, i dont want to feel this way. honest. i just keep thinking, "ah, ill get over this." yknow? i justit just keeps gettin harder. i dont, i dont know what to do. yknow? what do i do?  
<ross> i think you need to tell her how you feel. 
<joey> okay thats the green stuff talkin. 
<ross> no, im serious. you-you need to find out where she is, because if shes not where you are, then you can start to move past this. 
<joey> but what if uhand im not saying she will bebut 
<ross> if she is where you are then uh then my feeling weird about it shouldnt stand in the way. 
<joey> are you sure? 
<ross> yeah. look if-if shes gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldnt find a better guy. so 
<joey> hey thanks. 
<ross> so when do you think youre gonna talk to her? 
<joey> oh my god i have to tell her! i havent even thought about what i will say. what should i say? 
<ross> im understanding, but lets not get carried away. 
<joey> im sorry, youre right. what am i gonna say?  oh! 
<ross> yeah, tell me about it.  commercial break

<s> excuse me? 
<chandler> cheese, its smelly. you must smell a lot of the time too.

<monica> me too! yeah, chandler cant stand it. he wont even allow me to have blue cheese in the house. 
<s> and youre still married to him?  
<monica> you know what id love to do? i would like to go to france and eat nothing but bread and cheesenot even bread, just cheese. no, i want the bread. yeah. ah, and pastries  and pate. oh, im really not high, its just i used to be fat. 
<s> well if you where ever enter the loire valley let me know, ive got a great little villa you can stay at. 
<chandler> is it made of cheese? 
<s> no. but god, a house made of cheese, wouldnt that be incredible?! 
<monica> id move in tomorrow! 
<chandler>  oh come on!  are you listening to this? 
<phoebe> im so sorry. 
<chandler> what do we do? 
<phoebe> i dont know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! i dont know how you fight that. 
< 
<joey> okay. okay, i can do this. i can tell her how i feel. just uh, just stand up straight.  take a couple deep breaths.  look confident.

<chandler> yeah, fine. fine. not perfect!! but good enough. 
<monica> jeez! what is with you? 
<chandler> im sorry, did you say cheese? 
<monica> all right, whats going on? 
<chandler> phoebe thinks you and don are soul mates, and i dont believe in that kind of stuff. but then you two totally get along. so look, i wont stand in your way if you want to run off with don and live in a house of cheese. 
<monica> chandler, you dont believe in soul mates? 
<chandler> no. but im sure  tomatoes does. 
<monica> i dont believe in soul mates either. 
<chandler> you dont? 
<monica> no. i dont think that you and i were destined to end up together. i think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. some days we work really hard. 
<chandler> so you you dont want to live with don in a cheese house? 
<monica> no, ive had second thoughts about that. do you realize how hard that would be to clean? 
<chandler> i love you. 
<monica> i know. 
<chandler> yknow what? i am going to take you out to dinner tonight. i found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .  no? really? they taste so good.

<joey> what? yeah! sure! uh, look at the uh, the reason is it hot in here? 
<rachel> no. not-not for me, but why dont you take off your sweater?

<rachel> oh my god! really?! can i see it?

<rachel> well, at least you make each other laugh. 
<monica> whats up? 
<rachel> well, i havent seen him since that night that he told me how he yknow i dont know, i think hes avoiding me. why is that bagel on the floor? 
<monica> we were playing a game. 
<rachel> ew, was chandler naked? sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation? 
<monica> sure.

<joey> yeah, a naked bagel game?  dude, i dont know. thats a pretty small hole. 
<monica> honey, you gotta talk to her. 
<joey> i cant! yknow? you guys dont know what its like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down. 
<chandler>  i dont know what thats like?! up until i was 25 i thought the only response to, "i love you," was, "oh crap!" 
<monica> hello? no rejection? i got shot down at fat camp! boy, kids are mean when theyre hungry. 
<joey> all right so, so what do i do? 
<monica> this is rachel. i mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? i mean i know its weird, its awkward, but you gotta at least try.

<chandler>  we didnt play it!! opening credits 
< 
<phoebe> okay, so when youre done with your tea ill look at your leaves and tell you your fortune. 
<chandler> i didnt know you read tea leaves. 
<phoebe> oh yeah, ive done it for years. i actually stopped because i was so accurate. yknow, and-and yknow, one of the great joys of life is its-its wondrous unpredictability. yknow? and also tea tends to give me the trots. 
<monica> okay, im done. read mine. 
<phoebe> okay.  ooh, i see a ladder.  which can mean either a promotion or a violent death. 
<monica>  i-im the head chef. i-i cant get promoted. 
<phoebe> uh-hmm. uh-hmm, whos next? 
<rachel> okay, im done. do mine. 
<phoebe> okay.  umm, oh! okay, i see a circle. 
<rachel> ah. 
<phoebe> oh!  which can either mean youre having a baby or youre gonna make a scientific discovery! 
<rachel> well, i have been spending a lot of time in the lab. 
<chandler> what does yours say pheebs? 
<phoebe> umm wow, all right.  wow! yay! ooh, im gonna meet a guy! and really soon! and hes gonna be the man of my dreams. probably not the guy i had a dream about last night.  
<ross>  hey! has anyone seen my shirt? its a button down, like a, like a faded salmon? 
<monica> you mean your pink shirt? 
<ross> faded salmon color. 
<monica> no, i-i havent seen your pink shirt. 
<ross> great! great. then i mustve left it at monas. i knew it! 
<chandler> well, im sure you get another one at ann taylors. 
<ross> thats my favorite shirt! okay? i love that shirt! 
<rachel> well just ask mona to give it back! 
<ross> i dont know. i mean i-i guess i could. its just that we didnt really end things such good terms. and if i go over there id be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die.  
<phoebe>  oh wait a second you guys for the last couple weeks ive been that guy everywhere i go. we take the same bus. we go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe hes the tea guy.  
<chandler> phoebe, did you see that?! he totally checked you out! he is so cute!  mine has a picture of the village people, what does that mean?  
<rachel> hi! 
<joey> hey.  
<rachel> hi. 
<joey> hi.  
<monica> tea gives phoebe the trots. 
< 
<rachel> so i thought joey and i would be okay once we hung out, but its not even like we know how to be with each other anymore. 
<chandler> i know its tough now, but things will get better. 
<rachel> how do you know that? what if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we cant even be in the same room with each other?! 
<chandler> im not great at the advice, can i interest you in a sarcastic comment? some cheese? 
<monica> honey, what is the bruce springsteen cd in the kat stevens case? 
<chandler> lets just say if i cant find the right cd case i just put it in the nearest one. 
<monica> okay, where is the kat stevens cd? 
<chandler> in the james taylor case. 
<monica> where is the james taylor cd? 
<chandler> honey, im gonna save you some time, 200 cds, not one of them in the right case. 
<monica> okay. no need to panic. deep breathes everyone. okay umm uh, were just gonna have to spend some time and put the cds in the right cases. 
<chandler> well, if were gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. yknow alphabetically or by genre? 
<monica> hmm, i dont know. we really have to talk this through. 
<rachel> oh my god!! you guys have such problems!! i feel so terrible for you! 
<monica> okay, i-im sorry. you and joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. next time you see him try to get him talking about something else. 
<rachel> oh yeah. that makes sense. 
<monica> yeah, like i dont know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on. 
<rachel> ooh, i can do that. 
<monica> good.  uh honey, the miami vice soundtrack? really?

<phoebe> are you sure it wasnt an oyster? 
<joey> i guess it couldve been, i didnt really look at it. yknow, i just wiped it on chandlers coat and got the hell out of there. 
<phoebe> hes just such a great guy im so excited about him. 
<joey> oh hey, you should be excited about him. theres nothing wrong with him hes a good guy. 
<phoebe> you think? 
<joey> yeah. ya know what i think; i think we were all just being too negative. 
<phoebe> youre right. youre right, hes just embracing life. we could all stand to be a little more like parker. you know what? i am like him! im a sunny, positive person. 
<joey> actually, you have a little bit of an edge.

<ross> no, actually i thought about it when, when we were going out. its how i imagined i uh, i would ask you to marry me. 
<rachel> well, that wouldve been very hard to say no too. 
<ross> its a good thing i didnt do it, because it sounds like it wouldve been a very expensive wedding.  okay, good night

<joey> okay, you picked the gimmie card! you get all of rosss points! 
<ross> what?! 
<chandler> this game is kinda fun. 
<ross>  you dont think its a little crazy that you get all my points just cause you 
<chandler> i dont think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other. 
< 
<rachel> why did you invite my mother?! 
<monica> what? 
<rachel> she wants to move in with me and ross to help take care of the baby.

<monica> i personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me. 
<phoebe> she cant hear you. 
<rachel> what? you guys, come on! what am i going to do? 
<phoebe> well, if you dont want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.

<monica> thats right. that is right, you go over there and tell her you dont want her to live with you. do not take no for an answer! 
<rachel> okay.  
<monica>  this is great! now shes gonna be mad at rachel! yknow what? and im just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had. 
<phoebe> i have new respect for chandler. all right everybody! its time to open the presents! 
<monica> yes! yes! and i think that the first gift that rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because youre the most important person in this room. and in the world! until the last minute, but thank you so much for bringing that to everyones attention. 
<phoebe> how about you less important people, lets open your presents!  
<rachel> mom thats okay that you didnt get you a gift! 
<rachel> oh yeah. okay, see mom, the truth is i can do this on my own. you need a little help, especially at the beginning. 
<rachel> but mom, i really know what im doing. i can handle this. 
<rachel> he was a hamster! i am not going to vacuum up my baby! 
<phoebe> okay, come on rach its present time! yknow youre the glue thats holding this whole party together. its kinda falling apart here.

<s> its a diaper genie. 
<rachel> oh, it dispenses clean diapers! 
<s> no! its where you put the dirty ones! 
<rachel> well thats gross, why dont you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster? 
<rachel> what?! it goes ten times a day! what are we feeding this baby?! indian food?! 
<monica> rachel, listen to your mother. she is very smart. trotting out to the garbage ten times a day? 
<rachel> i dont know, id leave it on the changing table?  what?! whatd i do? whatd i do?! 
<rachel> oh comeof course i know that. i mean of course you never leave a baby alone! i mean who wouldshe wouldnt be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. oh god, okay. yknow what? i think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. so i think umm, im just gonna maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. and for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful. 
<s> its actually a bassinet. 
<rachel> okay mommy, dont ever leave me.  commercial break

<phoebe> not if you were here. 
<ross> wow! it looks like we got a lot of good stuff. 
<rachel> oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all. 
<ross>  a play-dough barber shop?

<ross> uh, what? 
<rachel> yes! shes gonna help us take care of the baby! woo-hoo.

<s> hey joey, hi! im ray; im the producer of the show. 
<joey>  its a pleasure to meet you ray. 
<s> and this is duncan  and erin, theyre gonna help us out with the audition. so uh, lets get the camera rolling. 
<joey>  rightie-o ray!

<joey>  hello, im joey tribbiani! lets play bamboozled! erin, you get the first question! in hockey, who is known as the great one? 
<s> wayne gretzky. 
<joey> correct! now, would you like to pick a wicked wango card or spin the wheel of mayhem? 
<s> uh joey, didnt your agents give you the revised rules? weve eliminated all of that. no wheel, no cards. 
<joey> whatwhy?! 
<s> uh well, the game was too complicated and research showed people didnt follow it. 
<joey> well whats complicated? you spin the wheel of mayhem to go up the ladder of chance. you go past the mud hut through the rainbow ring to get to the golden monkey; you yank his tail and boom! youre in paradise pond! 
<s> yeah all thats gone. its basically just a simple question and answer game now. 
<joey> well whats fun about that? you expect me to be the host of a boring game thats just people standing around answering questions? 
<s> well, therell be women in bikinis holding up the scores. 
<joey>  lets play bamboozled! 
< and all those dinosaur nick-knacks you have ross, i thought they might be more at home in the garage. 
<ross> well we we dont have a garage. 
<ross> yknow what? maybe, mrs. green, its not absolutely vital that you live with us. 
<rachel> i do. i really do. i dont know anything. 
<ross> im-im sure thats not true. 
<rachel> oh no? pheebs? monica? do i know anything about babies? 
<phoebe> no, not a thing. 
<monica> its frightening. 
<ross> well uh, yknow what? even if she doesnt know anything, i do! i have a son. and his mother and i didnt live together, and whenever he was with me i took care of him all the time, by myself. 
<ross> yeah. 
<ross> thats a different issue. uh, the point is, when the baby comes i will be there to to feed her and bathe her and change her. and more than that i want to do all those things. 
<ross> yes! yes, youre gonna be so missed. 
<ross> well youre gonna be a wonderful grandma.  
<rachel> hello?! i still dont know what the hell im doing! 
<ross> oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. youllyoure gonna pick it up.  hey! you will! uh look, yknow when you first came to the city? you were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddys credit card. do you remember? 
<rachel> i hope youre going somewhere with this. 
<ross> look at you! whatyoure-youre this big executive! you are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. i-i have no doubt youre gonna be an incredible mother. 
<rachel> really? 
<ross> im telling you. 
<rachel> thank you.  
<ross> oh.  its like im not here, which i almost wasnt. 
<monica>  youre still so funny. youre so funny.  what do i do? 
<phoebe> nothing! you have apologized to her like a million times and shes been nothing but terrible to you. and dont forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasnt even thanked you for it. 
<monica> yknow what? youre-youre right. 
<phoebe> yeah i mean if you want to say anything to her, id tell her off. 
<monica> really? 
<phoebe> uh-huh! 
<monica> okay! i will! mrs. green? mrs. green!  it is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! now what i did to you, it wasnt on purpose! but what youre during to me now is just plain spiteful! 
<monica> thats right! maybe its time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady old lady lady! 
<phoebe>  wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up 
<monica> so whenever youre ready to apologize to me, i will forgive you. good day!  i cant feel my legs! 
<phoebe> you were fantastic! im so proud of you! 
<monica> yeah? im proud of me too. 
<phoebe> you should be!

<rachel> uh, put your elbow in it. 
<ross> excellent! how do you put a baby down for a nap? 
<rachel> full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers. 
<ross> thats correct! this is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound?  
<rachel> check if its wet, check if its hungry, burp it! 
<ross> excellent! excellent, now-now do you want another question or a wicked wango card? 
<rachel> a card! a card! i pick a card!

<chandler> im so sorry. 
<monica> im so humiliated! 
<rachel> yeah but yknow what they say mon, "theres no such thing as bad press."

<monica> is he right? am i reallyam i awful?

<chandler>  what i do do is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.

<monica> well then somebodys snoozing. joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, i was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here.  
<chandler> i havent seen this dress. 
<monica> star in a movie. 
<phoebe> joey, you pick who ever you want. okay? you just listen to your heart. what does it tell you?  phoebe, phoebe. 
<joey> well uh i think i want to take chandler. 
<phoebe>  phoebe-phoebe-phoebe-phoebeburrrrr!  
<chandler> you really want to take me? 
<joey> yeah! yeah! i mean im sorry, i wish i can take everybody, but yknow chandler always supported my career. hes paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back. 
<chandler> so youre never actually going to pay me back? 
<monica> wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots youre gonna take him? joey, i dont think youre comprehending just how slutty this dress is! 
<joey> its not just the stuff he paid for, i mean its-its everything. yknow? he read lines with me. he-he went with me on auditions when i was really nervous, and then he consoled me after i didnt get parts that i really wanted. you always believed in me man. even, even when i didnt believe in myself. 
<chandler> i always knew you were gonna make it. im so proud of you. 
<joey> thanks. that means a lot to me.  
<phoebe> mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress. 
<joey>  im gonna go shave.  
<chandler>  yeah well, im gonna go spit.  
<rachel> oh, i have to pee. if i dont come out in five minutes its because ive choked to death on the potpourri stink.  
<phoebe> when she comes out, you hold her nose, ill blow in her mouth, and the kid will just  right out of her. 
<monica> shes over a week late! she gotta have it today, right? 
<phoebe> i dont know. i-i think its still gonna be a while. 
<monica> hmm, care to make it interesting? ill bet you that shell have it by this time tomorrow. 
<phoebe> youre on! 
<monica> okay, how much? 
<phoebe> one hundred thousand dollars! 
<monica> how about fifty bucks? 
<phoebe> fine! ill call zurich and move some money around. 
<rachel>  all right, whos turn is it to help me get up!  
<phoebe> no ones here!  oh damnit! 
< 
<chandler> this is so exciting! its so glamorous! people taking our picture. how do i look? 
<joey> a little tall. 
<chandler> what? 
<joey> do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that i look taller?  there you go.  
<chandler> its just so glamorous. 
< 
<phoebe> oh hey mon? rach is here! ohh, youre still pregnant. oh, im sorry. i know how uncomfortable you are. yknow what? you look great. yeah, like fifty bucks. 
<rachel> oh, i have to go pee. apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy.  
<monica> damnit! damnit!! heres your fifty bucks!  
<phoebe> its interesting that you lost. now, i forget, do you like to lose? 
<monica> now stop it! double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow! 
<phoebe> fine! youre on! 
<monica> okay. 
<phoebe> until then, general grant, why dont you set up camp  right there. 
<ross>  hey is rachel here? we have a doctors appointment. 
<monica> shes in the bathroom. 
<ross> rach, we gotta go. 
<rachel> in a minute!!! 
<ross> people ask me why were not together, i just dont know what to tell them. 
<rachel>  all right, all right. lets go! 
<ross> uh, do you wanna go change first? the doctors keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry 
<rachel> no, im fine. 
<ross> really? you dont think thats a little inappropriate.  
<phoebe> good god man dont anger it. 
<rachel> ross, it is 100 degrees outside. for the first time in weeks, i am somewhat comfortable. 
<ross> fine! fine! yknow what? whatever you want. okay? youre the mommy. 
<rachel> oh uh-uh pal! dont call me mommy! its bad enough you call your own mother that.  
<monica> im actually with her on this one. 
< 
<joey>  "i thought i knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along." 
<joey>  okay, this is it. its my big fight scene coming up.  
< 
<rachel> ross. 
<ross> yeah? 
<rachel> can i ask you something? 
<ross> uh-huh. 
<rachel> when carol was pregnant with ben 
<ross> mmm? 
<rachel> were you this irritating? 
<ross> wow! 
<rachel> excuse me?! 
<ross> oh nothing. nothing! just uh, youve been a little short with me lately. im not trying to irritate you. 
<rachel> well then you just must have a natural talent for it. 
<ross> yknow what? the doctor will be in soon, why dont we not speak until then. 
<rachel>  okay.  seriously, breathe louder ross! thats great! 
<ross> yknow we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby thats half human and half pure evil!  
<rachel> hi dr. long, how are you? 
<ross>  oh, youre nice to her. 
<rachel> she has the drugs! 
<rachel> okay.  
<rachel> yeah. 
<rachel> eh, just a tad. still could last a little while longer. if youre anxious there are a few ways to help things along. 
<ross> do them!! in my experience ive found that some of them are quite effective. 
<rachel> well, we are ready to try anything. 
<rachel> okay. 
<rachel> great! we will do all of those. taking a long walk, and then theres the one thats  
<ross> youve got to be kidding me! commercial break 
< 
<chandler> good job joe! well done! top notch! 
<joey> you liked it? you really liked it? 
<chandler> oh-ho-ho, yeah! 
<joey> which part exactly? 
<chandler> the whole thing! can we go? 
<joey> oh no-no-no, give me some specifics. 
<chandler> i love the specifics, the specifics were the best part! 
<joey> hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? did-did you like that part? 
<chandler> i was surprised to see a kangaroo in a world war i epic. 
<joey> you fell asleep!! there was no kangaroo! they didnt take any of my suggestions! thats for coming buddy. ill see you later.  
<chandler> dont go! im sorry. im so sorry!  look! this guy fell asleep! he fell asleep too! be mad at him!  or, call an ambulance. 
< 
<monica> hey! 
<ross> hey. 
<rachel> hi! 
<monica> what did the doctor say? any news on when the baby will come? 
<rachel> no. but she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor. 
<ross> yeah, we tried them all. we went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked. 
<rachel> well, there is one thing that we havent tried, but someone thinks that,  "that will open up a can of worms." 
<monica> well what is it? what is it? if its gonna help bring the baby here, like today. i mean, i think you should do it. 
<ross> its sex. 
<monica> do it! 
<ross> monica! 
<monica> im just saying its been a really long time for you. i mean, women have needs. do it, get yours! 
<phoebe> oh i-i dont know about that. no, i think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic. 
<monica> all right, lets be practical, if ross isnt willing to do it, hes not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. you can borrow chandlerchandler is good! 
<ross> monica, what is the matter with you? 
<monica> nothing. i just want the baby to be born today. 
<rachel> why? why today? 
<monica> okay fine! i keep betting phoebe that youre gonna have the baby and i dont want to lose again! 
<ross> what?! while shes been going through this hell, youve been making money?! youre betting on your friend staying in this misery?!  
<rachel> ill take that bet. 
<ross> what?! 
<rachel> well, im miserable here! i might as well make some money out it! 
<ross> can i get some of that action? 
<monica> wait a minute! now im betting against all three of you? 
<rachel> oh honey, dont worry. i really do feel like tomorrows the day. 
<monica> oh, okay!  
< 
<joey> hey! sleeping beauty! 
<chandler> where have you been?! i tried to call you! i want to talk to you! i still feel so bad! 
<joey>  oh no, were you upset? did you lose sleep? 
<chandler> im so sorry. 
<joey> uh-huh look, the only reason i can over here was to settle things between us! okay? youve done a lot for me and my career, i wanted to pay you back so i took you to the premiere but you missed it! okay, so how much do i owe you? 
<chandler> what?! 
<joey> give me a number, i dont want to owe you anything! 
<chandler> you dont owe me anything, i dont want you money 
<joey> ah-ah-ah! were doing this! okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. right, how much were those? 
<chandler> i dont know, five hundred dollars? 
<joey> okay, five hundred dollars. what else? 
<chandler> well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots. 
<joey> okay, so thats another five hundred. five hundred and five hundred, thats  
<chandler> do you want a calculator? 
<joey> please! 
<chandler> here!  
<joey> all right, what else? 
<chandler> well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes 
<joey> which were still keeping under our hats! 
<chandler> uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. which after twenty hours of lessons still came out jamaican. 
<joey> what the hell are you talking about,  "the south will rise again man." 
<chandler> yes, money well spent! 
<joey> yeah. okay, what else? rent!

<rachel> i am feeling nothing. speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you. 
<ross> stop it. 
<rachel> oh come on ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! we know whats gonna work! its doctor recommended! 
<ross> im sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! my god, im dying. 
<rachel> oh come on ross, weve done it before well do it again, itll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy. 
<ross> this is insane, im not gonna make love to you just so that youll go into labor. 
<rachel> make love? what are you a girl? 
<ross> always a great way to get in a mans pants. 
<rachel> but you will, you will be performing a service. okay? just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, yknow you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out. 
<ross> i love when you talk dirty to me. 
<rachel> oh, i know it. youre right. thats not sexy. oh oh!  whoops! oh, i seem to have dropped my fork. let me just bed over and get it.  oh god!

<phoebe> uh joey, were trying to dial down the crazy. 
<joey> right!

<rachel> yeah, and yknow what? i love them both, so why dont you just pick one and thatll be it. 
<ross> wow! umm, okay uh everyone this is isabella.  what?

<ross> its its complicated okay? 
<phoebe> yeah thats true. yeah, you love her. you always have. you have a child together. there is no right answer. 
<ross> look, weve been together. okay? and then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby.  its just if-if we got together again and it didnt work out i could never do that to emma. i mean she-she thinking everything oh thats now me. what do they put something in the water in this place? since rachel and i were doing really, were doing really well right now. 
<phoebe> i know. i know. i know. i know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.

<chandler> as we all are at some point during the day. 
<joey> it wasn’t my ring! it fell out of ross’s jacket! and when i knelt down to pick it up rachel thought i was proposing!

<joey> oh god, what the hell am i going to tell him? 
<chandler> well maybe you don’t have to tell him anything. 
<joey> oh, i like that. yeah… 
<chandler> if you clear things up with rachel then ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass! 
<joey>  now let’s not get carried away.  
<monica> i want a baby. 
<chandler> honey, we’ve been over this. i need to be facing the other way.

<joey>  are you kidding me?! 
<rachel> it’s just so frustrating! why doesn’t she want my breast?! 
<joey> i don’t know! maybe she’s crazy!  
< 
<phoebe> oh hey! wait up! 
<ross> hi! 
<phoebe> congratulations! i didn’t want to say anything in front of joey ‘cause i didn’t know if he knew yet. 
<ross> what, that we had a baby? come on let’s give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier. 
<phoebe> no! no, that you and rachel are engaged! 
<ross> what? 
<phoebe> oh, it’s a secret. oh goodie! yes! we haven’t done the secret thing in a long time. 
<ross> phoebe, there is no secret. okay? i didn’t propose. 
<phoebe> are you lying? is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor? 
<ross>  i am a doctor! y’know what? i’m just gonna go and talk to rachel myself. 
<phoebe> all right, me too.  should we wake her up? 
<ross> no! no, come on let her sleep! she’s so exhausted. 
<phoebe> and so engaged.  
<ross> what?  oh my god! she-she thinks we’re engaged! why? why? why would she think we’re engaged?! 
<phoebe> perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? y’know ross doctors are supposed to be smart. 
<ross> i didn’t give her that ring! 
<phoebe> really? 
<ross> no! 
<phoebe> so whose ring is it? 
<ross> it’s mine. 
<phoebe> is it an engagement ring? 
<ross> yes! 
<phoebe> but you didn’t give it to her? 
<ross> no! 
<phoebe> but you were going to propose? 
<ross> no!! 
<phoebe> huh, i might be losing interest in this. 
<ross> look. look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to rachel, but all i wanted to do is if she maybe…kinda…wanted ah…start…things up again. 
<phoebe> oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment. 
<ross> look, i didn’t want to rush into anything. and it seemed like she didn’t want to either. but i don’t, i don’t understand how any of this happened! what? did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that i was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people? 
<phoebe> no! no, she said you actually proposed to her. 
<ross> well i didn’t! i didn’t propose!  unless uh…  did i? i haven’t slept in forty hours and…it does sound like something i would do. commercial break 
< 
<chandler> look, we can’t stay in here forever. 
<monica> oh, i still can’t believe my dad saw us having sex! he didn’t make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees! 
<chandler> this is okay. we’re all adults here; there’s nothing to be ashamed of. now, let’s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.  
<monica> hi dad! i can still call you that right? 
<s> of course. i’ll always be your dad. 
<chandler> i just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn’t for fun. 
<monica> it wasn’t fun?! 
<chandler>  why? why-why-would you—wh-why…  look, i just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we want. 
<s> oh, i don’t think that. before today i never thought of you two having sex at all. it was a simpler time. 
<monica> the truth is, dad, we’re-we’re trying. 
<s> what? 
<monica> yeah, we’re trying to get pregnant. 
<s> oh my god! this is so exciting! well, get back in there!  i’ll guard the door! 
<monica> well, that’s okay dad, we-we can wait until later. 
<s> whoa-whoa-whoa! i don’t think so! aren’t you ovulating? 
<monica> daddy?! 
<s> well you gotta get at it princess! when your mother and i were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. that’s how i got my bad hip. 
<chandler> that’s funny, this conversation’s how i got the bullet hole in my head. 
<s> this one time i had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she was… 
<monica> daddy! i don’t think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex. 
<s> you’re right, you’re right. this is about your positions. now, what i saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, although it might feel good. 
<monica> i don’t feel good right now. 
<s> but pleasure is important,  and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. you up to the task sailor? 
<chandler> seriously sir, my brains? all over the wall. 
< 
<monica> hey. 
<rachel> hey. i need to tell you something. 
<monica> well, now’s a good time. i’m on my way to have my ears cut off. 
<rachel> joey asked me marry him. 
<monica> what? 
<rachel> joey proposed to me. 
<monica> is he crazy?! you just had ross’s baby! 
<rachel> well, i-i said yes. 
<monica> what?! are you crazy? you just had ross’s baby! it’s-it’s so inappropriate. no, it’s worse than that. it’s wrong. it’s… it is bigger than mine!  
<rachel> i know. days of our lives, thank you very much. 
<monica> you can’t marry him! 
<rachel> why not? i don’t want to do this alone! and he’s such a sweet guy and he loves me so much. 
<monica> well do you love him? 
<rachel> sure. 
<monica> sure? 
<rachel> yeah, i mean whatever. 
<monica> honey, the question is…do you really want to marry joey? 
<rachel> no. no, i don’t. could you be a dear and go tell him? 
< 
<chandler> you still haven’t told rachel you weren’t really proposing? 
<joey> no! she had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out. 
<chandler> joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! and what did it look like?! 
<joey> i didn’t look at it. stupid baby’s head was blocking most of it. 
<chandler> go and tell rachel right now before ross finds out. 
<joey> look, it’s not that easy. she said she wanted to marry me. i don’t want to hurt her. 
<chandler> okay, look, just do it gently. 
<joey> you’re right. you’re right. i-i’ll go tell her now before ross finds out and i’ll be gentle. i can do that. i am a gentle person. oh, by the way. two people screwing in there  if you want to check that out. 
< 
<ross> hey. 
<rachel> hey. 
<ross> listen, i um… i heard about the engagement. 
<rachel> surprised? 
<ross> and confused. rach, sweetie, i-i um…i didn’t propose to you. 
<rachel> i know. 
<ross> i don’t think you do. 
<rachel> you didn’t propose to me. joey did. 
<ross> poor baby, you’re so tired. rach, i didn’t propose to you, joey didn’t propose to you, and chandler didn’t propose to you. 
<rachel> uh… you didn’t propose to me, chandler didn’t propose to me, but joey did.  
<ross> joey proposed to you? 
<joey> i can come back. 
<ross> hey, wait! wait-wait-wait! joey, did you propose to her? 
<joey> no. 
<rachel> yes you did! 
<joey> actually, technically, i didn’t. 
<rachel> well then why did you give me a ring? 
<ross> wait! whoa-whoa, you…you gave her the ring? 
<joey> no! no, and i did not ask her to marry me! 
<rachel> yes, you did! 
<joey> no, i didn’t! 
<rachel> yes, you did! 
<joey> no, i didn’t! 
<rachel> yes, you did! and don’t you say, "no, i didn’t!" 
<joey> ahhh! 
<rachel> he was right there. he got down on one knee and proposed. 
<ross> whoa! you were down on one knee? 
<joey> yeah. yeah, that looks bad. but i didn’t…i didn’t propose! 
<ross> then what did happen? 
<rachel> yeah, what did happen? 
<joey> okay, the ring fell on the floor and i went down to pick it up and you thought i was proposing. 
<rachel> yeah, but you said, "will you marry me?" 
<joey> no, i didn’t! 
<rachel> yes, you did! 
<joey> no, i didn’t! 
<rachel> yes, you did—oh my god you didn’t!  well then why didn’t you tell me that before?! 
<joey> well i tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out! 
<ross> whoa! hey! whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?! 
<joey>  i’ll tell you about it later. be cool. 
<rachel> well then joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?! 
<joey> it wasn’t my ring! it’s ross’s ring! that’s why i felt so bad rach, because he was going to propose. 
<ross> what?! 
<rachel> you were gonna propose to me? 
<ross> uhh… no.  
<joey> well, this is awkward. {see? i told you so.} 
<ross> but i-i was going to see if y’know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that—i mean that-that was all, rach. 
<joey> dude, step up! i proposed. 
<ross> no, you didn’t! 
<joey> oh that’s right. there’s a lot going on here and i think i ate some bad fruit earlier.  
<s> hey, she just woke up! she’s hungry. why don’t we give this another try? 
<rachel> okay. 
<ross>  i can’t believe you told her i was going to propose! 
<joey> i can’t believe you’re not going to propose! 
<ross> hey, i’m not going to rush into anything! 
<joey> oh yeah, dude, i totally understand. usually after i have a baby with a woman i like to slow things down! 
<rachel> oh my god! 
<ross> what? 
<rachel> she’s doing it look, she’s breast-feeding look! 
<joey>  ah, it’s beautiful. 
<s> i’ll come back for her later.

<rachel> honey don’t worry, it was my mistake. 
<joey> no, rach, i should’ve told you sooner. it’s just that…man! that kid is going to town!  
<rachel> she’s perfect. 
<ross> we’re so lucky. 
<rachel> we really are. 
<ross> look, i-i know it’s not a proposal and i don’t know where you are, but with everything that’s been going on and with emma and…i’ve been feeling…

<monica>  hey dad! 
<chandler> hey.

<rachel> okay you have to realize, i was exhausted, i was emotional, i would have said yes to anybody. like that time you and i got married!  i’m not helping. 
<ross> so you said yes to him, and you just had our baby? 
<rachel> that is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but i am prepared to let that go. 
<ross> so when i came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend. 
<rachel> well—really? i thought chandler was your best friend. 
<ross> well, chandler’s my oldest friend, but joey’s my—no! ah!

<ross>  what!  you didn’t do anything wrong?! 
<joey> i said i didn’t technically. 
<ross> okay let’s put aside that you  "accidentally" picked up my grandmothers ring and you  "accidentally" proposed to rachel. 
<joey> look, can i just stop you right there for a second? when people do this  i don’t really know what that means.  you were saying?

< 
<chandler> umm ma’am, do you have a minute?  i kind of have some bad news. i don’t think i can move to tulsa. 
<chandler> it’s a funny story, actually.  i kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when i said i’d move to tulsa, i didn’t really know what i was saying. 
<chandler> but only because i was up all night worried about this meeting, ain’t that funny? irony? not a fan, alright . see, here’s the thing. i went home and told my wife about tulsa and she won’t go. see, me, i love tulsa!  tulsa is heaven!  tulsa is italy—please don’t make me go there!

<ross> well, i thought so too, but then she said she’d marry you. 
<joey> come on, ross, that didn’t mean anything! she just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody. 
<ross> yeah that’s what she said. 
<joey> so? 
<ross> so i don’t wanna be just anybody. 
<joey> wow. 
<ross> you know what, it’s, it’s better this way anyway. i mean i don’t know what i was thinking, going down that road again with us. it’s just much easier if we’re just friends who have a kid. 
<joey> really? 
<ross> yeah. 
<joey> and you’re okay with that? 
<ross> yes. i mean, it’s what we always planned.  and if you have a plan, you should stick to it.  that’s why they call them plans. hello?  i’m fine. 
<joey> hey, for what it’s worth, with rachel i don’t think you’ll ever be just  "anybody." 
<ross> hey there you go!  
<joey>  "thanks."

<joey> i know, yeah. i feel like we're all growing up. person named wiener, god that kills me.  
<phoebe> look at you all grown up. 
<joey> actually, you know what? i am. that whole thing with rachel made me realize that maybe i'm ready for a more serious relationship. you know? like i'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. and looks aren't as important as...nah, she's gotta be hot. 
<phoebe> you know, i might know somebody. hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date! 
<joey> i can do that, yeah. how is friday?

<monica> it's great! how? chandler. well my boss and i worked out a deal where i only have to be in tulsa four days a week, so the other three i can be here with you. 
<monica> so you're gonna be gone four days a week?  no. 
<chandler> i'm sorry, are you just used to saying that? 
<monica> no. i can't be away from you for that long. 
<chandler> really? 
<monica> yeah, you're my husband. i'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year. 
<chandler> that's fast math! we could use you in tulsa. 
<monica> honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to tulsa, i wanna go with you. 
<chandler> hey, you said that without gagging! 
<monica> i know!  
< 
<rachel>  excuse me? oh yeah? well, up yours too!

<rachel> dr. wiener. 
<ross> rach, you can't call people at three in the morning. 
<rachel> oh you know what, you sound just like his wife! 
<ross> was there anything you did wrong with emma? 
<rachel> yes, of course there is! okay? i'm not insane! 
<ross> well, what was it? 
<rachel> hiccups. 
<ross> rach, i told you, you can't call him every time any little thing comes up. 
<rachel> yeah well, not anymore i can't. he fired us! what are we gonna do? we have to find a pediatrician. wait wait, monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. what was his name? 
<ross> dr. gettleman? yeah i know, i don't think that's a good idea. in fact, i think he's dead. 
<rachel> argh! why does everything happen to me?! 
<ross> rach, i promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but i gotta get up early and i'm not feeling all that well. 
<rachel> what? what, do you mean you're not feeling well? what do you have? is it rubella? because don't go near emma, she has not had that shot. 
<ross> you know? come to think of it, it does feel rubella-like!  
<rachel>  wiener, wiener  wiener, wiener!!! 
<ross>  rachel!!! 
<rachel> great! now he's gonna know it was me! 
< 
<phoebe>  hey! 
<joey> hey! 
<phoebe> so how is this for our big double date tonight?  
<joey>  oh my god! 
<phoebe> ooh, great! just the reaction i was hoping for. 
<joey> yeah, so you found someone for me. you didn't forget? 
<phoebe> of course not! and you're gonna love mary ellen. she's really smart and cute and funny, and i can't tell you how i know this, but she' not opposed to threesomes. so tell me some about my guy. 
<joey> no. 
<phoebe> come on, give me something. what's his name? 
<joey> mike. 
<phoebe> mike? okay! what's his last name? 
<joey> damnit! is there no mystery left in romance anymore!? 
<phoebe> all right, we'll se you and mike at the restaurant in a couple hours. 
<joey> why did i have to say mike? i don't know a mike! why couldn't i have said...  there's no guy in there! 
< 
<rachel> it's impossible to find a good doctor. i mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee? 
<monica> excuse me? 
<chandler> i know what she's talking about. 
<rachel> we've got to find a new pediatrician. ross was getting sick last night, and i think emma may have caught it. 
<monica> why don't you go see dr. gettleman? 
<rachel> ross said he died. 
<monica> he didn't die. i saw his daughter last week. said he was fine. her on the other hand, botched botox. 
<rachel> oh, great! well, then i'm gonna take emma to see him. i wonder why ross said that he died. 
<monica> oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist. 
<chandler> he saw a therapist? 
<monica> yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out. 
<rachel> why? what was it? 
<monica> that i was going to eat him. 
<  
<joey> mike!!! 
<s> yeah? 
<joey>  okay!  
< 
<s> i gotta tell you, i can't believe i'm doing this with you. although i did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so i guess i should be open and taking some risks. 
<joey> everything is gonna be fine. just follow my lead, okay? all you have to do is pretend to be mike. 
<s> i am mike. 
<joey> atta boy!  
<joey> okay, look... 
<phoebe> joey, this is mary ellen jenkins. so, mike, how do you and joey know each other anyway? 
<s> how do i and joey know each other? wow, if i had a nickel for every time somebody has asked me that. 
<joey>  from school. 
<s> yeah, we met in college.  i mean, high school. 
<phoebe> wow, you guys go way back then. so what are you up to these days? 
<s> well, i'm a lawyer. 
<joey> mike, 'attorney at law'! 
<s> actually, i just gave up my practice. 
<joey> what? that's the kinda thing you usually run by me. 
<s> i always wanted to play piano professionally, and i figured if i don't do this now, i never will. 
<phoebe> wow, that's great! i liked that better than the law thing, so... 
<joey> which is why i waited until now to introduce you to mike. 
<joey> no, no, that's not what i meant. let's get you a cocktail. 
<  
<monica> hey! 
<chandler> hey! 
<monica> what are you doing? 
<chandler> looking for restaurant jobs for you in tulsa. 
<monica> that's so sweet. find anything? 
<chandler> slim pickings. 
<monica> nothing, huh? 
<chandler> no, 'slim pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. they're looking for a cook. actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. they're looking for someone to shovel mesquite. 
<monica> 'slim pickings'...that is so cheesy. 
<chandler> 'so cheesy' also has an opening. 
<monica> honey, that's okay. i actually know this woman, nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. maybe she'll know of something. 
<chandler> can i just say how much i appreciate you coming with me. when we get to tulsa i'm taking you for a great dinner at 'slim pickings'. 'so cheesy'? 'whole hog'? it's going to be tough to keep kosher in tulsa. 
<monica>  hi, nancy. hi, it's monica geller. i'm good. listen, i'm looking for a job in tulsa. well yeah, my husband has been relocated...because i love him! no, i don't want a job in new york. javo  is looking? oh my god! he asked for me personally? oh my god! oh, wow, this is really flattering, but i'm moving to tulsa. yeah, so if you would tell javo  'i'll take it!' 
< 
<rachel> hi, my name is rachel green, i have an appointment for emma. 
<s> dr. gettleman is finishing up with a patient, he should be out shortly. not strep. 
<ross> thanks doctor. 
<ross> you even have to ask?!   he is alive! 
< 
<phoebe> you know, it's so surprising that you and joey have known each other for so long and i've never heard about you. 
<joey> yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. mike hit my mom with a car. 
<s> no, i didn't. 
<joey> that's okay mike, i have forgiven you. and now we're friends again everything's great! mary ellen wait, is your mom okay? 
<joey> please, we're trying to have a conversation.  
<s> 'days of our lives'! that's why you look so familiar! 
<phoebe> what?! 
<s> what?! 
<joey> what?! 
<phoebe> do you not know each other? 
<joey>  of course we do! mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school. yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other. we played all kinds of games.  hey, remember the one where i punch you in the face for not being cool?! 
<phoebe> mike, let me ask you something. how many sisters does joey have? 
<s>  six! 
<joey> what are you doing? i said seven!  argh!!! 
<phoebe> joey, why did you set me up with a stranger? 
<joey> because i forgot about our date, i'm so sorry. 
<s> i'm sorry too. and just to be clear, i didn't hit his mother with a car. 
<phoebe>  you are unbelievable! i spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. mary ellen is really smart and cute and loose. 
<phoebe> who are you kidding?  you just find some guy off the street for me? oh god! this is humiliating! 
<joey> look phoebe i'm so sorry! hey, look, if you don't like this guy i can find you a better one.  mike!! mike!! 
<phoebe> i'm out of here  
<s> it was nice meeting you! 
<joey>  you're leaving too? 
<joey> good night! 
< 
<chandler> honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do. 
<monica> you're right.  maybe i shouldn't go. 
<chandler> what? 
<monica> so nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, javo . it's just a little outside of tulsa. 
<chandler> how far outside? 
<monica> manhattan. 
<chandler> and you're thinking of taking it?  so before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but i guess now it's old job,  me,  new job. 
<monica> i'm gonna miss this hand! okay i know it's a lot to ask, but oh my god chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. 
<chandler> what happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'? 
<monica> well, if you really think about it, i mean four days is not that long. i mean, i see you monday before you go to work, and i see you thursday when you get back, and i always work late on tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. and well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend. 
<chandler> i think you should take the job. 
<monica> really? 
<chandler> yeah. i know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey. 
<monica> that's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!  
<ross> hey! 
<monica> how was the pediatrician? 
<rachel> oh, i really liked him.  yeah, it was really, really, really good. 
<ross> you promised you wouldn't say anything. 
<rachel> i know.  ross still sees his pediatrician!!!  i don't care! 
<monica> are you serious? you still see dr. gettleman? 
<ross> he's a brilliant diagnostician! 
<chandler> diagnostician or boo-boo fixer? 
<rachel> ross, seriously! you've gotta go to an appropriate doctor. 
<ross> why? why? i know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? he knows my medical history, and every time i go in there, he makes a big deal. 'ah look, it's my favorite patient!' 
<chandler> does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy? 
<ross> hey, i seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college! 
<chandler> that was not a security blanket! that was a wall-hanging! 
<ross> it didn't spend much time on the wall!!! 
< 
<s> excuse me, hi. i was hoping i would run into you. can we talk? 
<phoebe> sure. 
<s> i'm sorry, really, i'm so embarrassed. really, i'm a pretty nice guy. just ask my parole officer...apparently i'm not a funny guy. 
<phoebe> why did you go along with that? 
<s> because i was told i'd get a free dinner, which i didn't. and that i'd meet a pretty girl. which i did. 
<phoebe> that's true.  well, is anything you told me about yourself true? 
<s> my name in mike, and i do play piano. 
<phoebe> prove it. 
<s> there isn't a piano here. 
<phoebe> that wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist. 
<phoebe> you are really good! i play a little guitar myself. 
<s> really? 
<phoebe> uhuh. 
<s> that's great. what kind of music do you play? 
<phoebe> well, like acoustic folksy stuff. you know? but right now i'm working on a couple 'iron maiden' covers. 
<s> do you think that maybe, sometime, i could... 
<phoebe> it's okay. go ahead, ask me out. 
<s> okay. do you think maybe sometime i could take you out? 
<joey>  
<phoebe>  oh, you just caught me off guard! yeah, that would be nice. 
<joey> look at this. my two best friends!  
< 
<ross> excuse me, i don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby with the rash came in after me. 
<s> the doctor will be right with you sir. 
<s>  mommy, i can't find waldo. 
<ross> with the circus? he's behind the elephant. 
<s> wow, so your child is a big fan of the waldo books too? 
<ross> yeah, that's how i know. i'm ross by the way. 
<s> hi, i'm sally. so, no ring. can i assume you are also a single parent? 
<ross> i am a single parent. 
<s> it's hard isn't it? there's almost no time for a social life. i mean, where are you gonna meet someone? 
<ross> well, let's say, i don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office. 
<s>  rossy, we're ready for you. 
<ross> hmm, yeah.  come on ross jr. it's time to go in.

<monica> eww are you talking about my bother. 
<rachel> yeah i didn't disguise that very well did i. 
<joey>  hey 
<rachel>  hi 
<joey> listen to this... i went out with this girl last night and half way through our date i realized i already slept with her.  
<rachel> so basically you've slept with all the woman in new york and now you're just going around again. 
<joey> well that's not even the weird part. i don't think she remembered sleeping with me. 
<monica> but you don't remember sleeping with her. 
<joey> yeah but she should remember sleeping with me i am very memorable, you guys know. 
<rachel> what, how do we know, we never slept with you. 
<joey> and who's fault is that. 
<monica> what's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe you were having an off night 
<joey> hey! i never have an off night ok although sometimes when i'm a little bloated i don't feel very sexy but even then i'm better then most! 
<monica> honey why don't you just let it go and ask her out again. 
<rachel> yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember who you've slept with, you're made for each other. 
<joey> interesting. all right i'll go out with her again and try to get past it  oh salt bloaty! 
<monica> joey, joey. 
<joey> what? 
<monica> you don't think sharks are sexy do you? 
<joey> no.  wait a minute what was the little mermaid?  
< 
<phoebe> it's open. 
<ross> hey! 
<phoebe> hey! mike called were going out again! yay! yay!  
<ross> yay!  quick thing, i went to talk to mike. 
<phoebe> what? wha-wha-wha-did you do ross! 
<ross> oh boy you got mad at that part. i went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me blah, blah, blah, and i ended up telling him that. 
<phoebe> what! 
<ross> umm. that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named vicrum. 
<phoebe> what! why? 
<ross> well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship. 
<phoebe>  if you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend i swear to lucifer a rabid dog would be feasting on your danglers right now! 
<ross> well phoebe, i think you'll feel better when you know a little bit about vicrum, his a kite designer  and he used to date oprah.  
<phoebe> i'm not going along with some lie you made ross, no i'm just gonna be honest with him. 
<ross> good yeah just be honest with him. 
<phoebe> yeah i've nothing to be ashamed of ok so i haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. ok i haven't had a real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will and that's ok. so i'll just be alone forever you know alright i'll be. it'll be fine. it'll be fine. i'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. oh  
<ross> i'll get it 
<phoebe> ok 
<s>  you know i'm trying to think of the last time i opened a door and you weren't there, phoebe are you ok?  
<phoebe> uh huh yeah  there's just something umm, there's something you should know  vicrum just called. 
< 
<s> so it was kind of a shock after 25 years of marriage my parents, a perfect couple getting divorced, i kinda took it the hardest cause i was the youngest. 
<joey> uh huh, sure, yeah. how can you not remember me? 
<s> what? 
<joey> how could you not remember that we slept together? 
<s> what! when? 
<joey> i dunno! 
<s> i really, really think i would remember sleeping with you 
<joey> come on, come on, search your brain all right. it was  a certain amount of time ago, i was here you were here, we had sex  here, here, here not there. anything? 
<s> no it's not ringing any bells. 
<joey> my god woman! how many people do you have to had been with not to remember any of this? 
<joey> ooooooooooh, i slept with you! and you obviously remember me hey! i still got it.  so were good.  i'll let myself out. 
< 
<phoebe> .and i said vicrum you can't just call every time you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with rachel. 
<s> but rachel i thought she just had a baby with ross 
<phoebe> yeah well  yeah you know emma's birth certificate might say geller but her eyes say mookurgee. 
<s> that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer. 
<phoebe> i know but he call's and my heart goes to him. you know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer. 
<s> i just think there's somebody better out there for you,  i mean i'm not saying me but. maybe me. 
<phoebe> oh. 
<s> and you don't have to worry about glue sniffing with me. although i do smell the occasional magic marker, yeah ah anyway i just think i can make you happy. 
<phoebe> ok i can't do this. 
<s> what's wrong? 
<phoebe> well there is no vicrum, ross made him up because i never really have been in a long-term relationship, i've never lived with a guy, and i've never even celebrated an anniversary so.  if that's too weird for you and you wanna leave i totally understand. in fact i'll close my eye's make it less awkward  you kissed me. 
<s> uh huh 
<phoebe> so you don't think i'm a total freak 
<s> no. well look can i think your weird and also cool for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you. 
<phoebe> i guess so, can i. can i think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again  and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers. 
<s> definitely 
<ross>  this is vicrum. 
<

<monica> oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. or does it always have to be sharks?

<joey>  see ordinarily i would talk to her, but my confidence is shaken did i sleep with her? did i not sleep with her? 
<phoebe> you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your whole dating attitude. your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious.

<s> is it? 
<phoebe>  maybe not, is it? 
<s> okay, when i got divorced, i didn't think i'd feel this way about someone for a really long time... then again, i didn't think i'd meet someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... i want you to have this...  no, not... that's gum.  ooh, five bucks... i love it when that happens, you know... think no note's there... 
<phoebe>  i know mike, why don't you keep digging?

<joey>  oh, i know it... it is amazing these little things open doors... huh!

<rachel> so i don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that emma could get a chance to know her. the easier we can make the transition for her, the better.  
<rachel> that's great, great. so do you have any questions for us? 
<rachel> allright. well thank you so much for coming...  
<ross> thank you. 
<rachel> really nice to meet you... and we'll call you. playing with her hair) do you guys do random drug testing? 
<ross> boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that. days notice. 
<rachel> okidoki!  wow! we're never gonna find a nanny. 
<ross> oh, come on rach, we will. i promise. we have more interviews  and worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with. 
<rachel>  what, the blonde with no bra? 
<ross> she was blonde?  just a sec.! okay, okay. this one's name is sandy. she's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.

<phoebe>  oh my god! david! 
<s> hi! i-i-is this a bad time? 
<phoebe>  no! it's a great time, come in...! wow, hi... oh my gosh! what are you doing here? are you back from minsk? 
<s> well, just for a couple of days, uhm... i'm here to explain to the people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that we spent all their money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing. 
<phoebe> who cares, it got you here. 
<s> well, it got me to new york anyway, and then i got on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to? and i just... gave him your address i... i... i didn't even think about it. 
<phoebe> wow. where is your luggage?  
<s> damn it! 
<phoebe> a-allright, well... i'll call the cab company. 
<s> wa... wa... wait! we can... call them later. can you just... just stand there f-f-for a moment? boy! there's an old russian expression, uhm... it 
<s> schto ya ztez vigul... ui! roughly translated that means uhm... this thing 
<phoebe> thank you! god, no! you should see me when... oh actually, no, i look pretty good. 
<s> are... are you kidding? you know, when you don't see someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and you start thinking 
<s> come on, don't be crazy. nobody is that beautiful, but... well, you are.  well, so, uhm... are you seeing... anyone?  
<phoebe> no... 
< 
<phoebe> i'm... i'm just... i'm the worst person ever. how can i not tell david that i'm seeing mike? 
<monica> maybe he didn't give you a chance. 
<phoebe> he said 
<monica> oh, well... that had been your window. 
<phoebe> yeah! i mean, i don't know. i was just , i was looking, i was looking just, he's so irresistible. 
<monica> really? the scientist guy? 
<phoebe> really? chandler? 
<monica> continue... 
<phoebe> oh.okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then i told him that i would see him tomorrow night. 
<monica> phoebe! 
<phoebe> i know!  evil! and... and... and... i like mike so much, you know. it's just going really well. oh my god! 
<monica> wow, isn't it ironic that david would show up on the same day that you and mike exchange keys? 
<phoebe>  uhuh... yeah...!, you know. and given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy i am. 
<monica> what are you gonna do? 
<phoebe> i mean i guess, i just have to... tell david that nothing can happen between us. unless i don't... you know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong... 
<monica> you have to tell david! 
<phoebe> okay, i knew i should have had this conversation with joey. 
< 
<chandler>  funniest guy she's ever met!  i'm funny, right...? what do you know, you're a door... you just like knock-knock jokes...  save it for inside!  
<monica> heeeeeey! 
<chandler> hey! 
<phoebe> hey! 
<chandler> so... oklahoma is a crazy place. you know, they call it the sooner state. frankly i'd sooner be in any other state.  and what's with oklahoma having a pan handle? can all states have stuff like that? hey yeah, i'm from the waistband, wyoming. but when i was seven, we headed over to the crotch. 
<monica>  was your cabin pressurised? 
<chandler>  and don't get me started on the way that people from tulsa talk. 
<phoebe> okay.  
<chandler> what's with the word y'all? you know, just... two words just... pushed together... are we all allowed to do that, because if so, i say why stop there? you know, your new poodle could be your noodle. and fried chicken? could be fricken.waiter, waiter excuse me, i'll have the fricken?  see, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right? 
<monica> no, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. i told you about that funny guy, geoffrey, right? 
<chandler> yeah, he came up... 
<monica> well, he did this bit... you probably had to be there, but it was liza minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken.  
<chandler>  were you there? 
<phoebe> no, but it sounds like it was fricken funny... 
< 
<s> i really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person. i mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your heart...  
<rachel> sandy, that's exactly what it is... 
<ross> are you gay?  
<rachel> ross! 
<s> it's okay. i get that a lot doing what i do. but i am straight. i-i'm engaged actually. 
<rachel> oh! 
<s> her name is deliah. 
<rachel> oh, that's pretty. 
<ross>  so you're just like a... guy who's a nanny? 
<s> i realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, but i really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a child. 
<ross>  okay. 
<s> like in my last job, i met daniel when he was three weeks old. and i was his name for me... i'll see you every day... right in...  
<ross> yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.

<rachel> oh, that would be great!  i love him, i love him, i love him... 
<ross> oh, come on, rach, he's a guy! 
<rachel> so wh..? he's smart, he's qualified. give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out. 
<ross> because, it's weird! 
<rachel> why? 
<ross> what kind of job is that for a man? a nanny? i-it's like if a woman wanted to be... 
<rachel>  yes? 
<ross> king? 
<s> i er... i hope you don't mind. i used some of my home-made lotion on emma. it's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. it'll dry that rash right up. plus... it keeps the hands young...  
<rachel>  please?  yes! sandy you're hired. 
<s> that's great!  i'm sorry. it's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family...

<chandler> hey!  i need you to set me up for a joke. later, when monica is around, i need you to ask me about fire trucks. 
<joey> ooh. i-i don't know chan. i'm not so good with remembering lines. 
<chandler>  well, thank god your livelihood doesn't depend on it. 
<joey> i know, right?  wh... wh... why are we doing this? 
<chandler> monica says that her maitre d. is the funniest guy she's ever met. 
<joey> seriously? she actually said that? 
<chandler> yes! am i crazy to be this upset? 
<joey> nooooo! being funny is your thing!

<phoebe> well... but david, just... i just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things i've ever had to do. 
<s> well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly a vladnik carnival either... can we at least hug goodbye? 
<phoebe> of course, yeah. you know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...

<phoebe> i mean...  
<s> in minsk... 
<phoebe> yeah?

<ross>  okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. he is too sensitive.  
<rachel> what...? too sensitive to take care of our baby? 
<ross>  yeah, i mean, all things that guy...  these are amazing! 
<rachel> sandy made madeleines. 
<ross> this... this is exactly what i'm talking about. what kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate french cookies, huh? they're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks.  
<rachel> well, i... you know, i-i-i don't know what to say... i mean, i never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. you know, 'cause i gotta tell you ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle. 
<ross> hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive. 
<rachel> okay, what? what is too sensitive?

<phoebe> hmmm... no, no... no, i can't do this. it's bad.

<ross> science...? academia...? being a good father...? 
<joey> ...no...  
<monica> i can't believe he's that upset about this... 
<joey> monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'cause he's feeling like...

<joey> well, i just tape it to the back of my toilet tank.  i didn't say that! it's in a bank guarded by robots! 
<chandler> do you have any ideas?

<ross> i uhm... well, i sang...  well actually i rapped... baby got back...  
<rachel> you what? you sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses? 
<ross> but you know what, if you think about it, it actually promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy doubles. 
<rachel>  owwwww... 
<ross> please don't take her away from me!

<s> thank you, i think so too. 
<phoebe> well, and you know, it really is a testament to how he was raised. especially to you. because he's very respectful of women. 
<s> is he really? 
<phoebe> are you kidding. he is so considerate of my feelings and... you know i think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle lover. 
<s> e-e-excuse me? 
<phoebe>  oh no, no, no, no, no, no. don't get me wrong. no, he's not in like a sissy way. no, no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave...

<chandler> i'm not gonna watch it... i don't need to watch it... i mean, what good could possibly come from watching?  well, we know i'm gonna watch it.  
<joey> hey dude, what's up? 
<chandler> don't judge me, i'm only human! 
<joey> did you take that tape? 
<chandler> i had to! okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... wouldn't you need to know what was on it? 
<joey> i don't know. who'm i'm married to? 
<chandler> some girl...!? 
<joey> she hot? 
<chandler> yeah...!? 
<joey> how did she get me to settle down? 
<chandler> allright, i'm gonna watch it... i mean look, it's probably not even what i think it is... and even if it is... it can't possibly be as bad as what i'm picturing in my head...  can it? 
<joey> guess i don't know. my experience taped... she doesn't say no to much else, i tell ya... 
<chandler> then you're gonna have to watch it for me. 
<joey>  what? whoo... what? 
<chandler> just for a few seconds, so i can know what it is... please? 
<joey> all right, fine... but if i enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame...  
<chandler> why am i hearing cheering? 
<joey> well it's okay, its like... its just a football game. 
<chandler> football? just football? 
<joey> yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing. 
<chandler> it's football... it's just football... this is great! this is the first time i've ever enjoyed football... it may be customary to get a beer...  what the...  what are you doing? 
<joey> you don't wanna see what i just saw!  
<monica> what are you guys doing?  oh my god, is that richard?  
< 
<rachel> okay... aahhh... please laugh for mommy... please? please laugh for mommy...  not funny huh? oh so, is it... only offensive novelty rap? or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'cause mommy can rap...  my name is mommy and i'm here to say / that all the babies are... oh, i can't rap... allright sweetheart... this is only because i love you so much, and i know that you're not gonna tell anybody...  i like... big butts and i cannot lie... / you other brothers can't deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face...  yes! yes! yes! yes! oohhhhh! oh!  i like big butts and i cannot lie... / you other brothers can't deny... oh emma you're laughing! oh you are, you really do like big butts, don't you. oh you beautiful little weirdo...  
<ross> hey! 
<rachel> oh you missed it. she was laughing. oh it was amazing. it was amazing. it was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that... 
<ross> oh i know, isn't it? ooh... what'd you do to get her to laugh? 
<rachel> oh! you know, i just... couple of things i tried ... i just sang a little doo... itsy bitsy spider... 
<ross> you sang baby got back didn't you? 
<rachel> nothing else worked. that girl is all about the ass... 
< 
<phoebe> ...and then it goes back to the chorus... smelly cat, sme-lly ca-t / i-t's not your fau-lt. and that's the end of the song... i realise that you didn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen minutes. 
<s> phoebe writes lots of great songs. wha... what was that one you sang the other night that everybody just loved? 
<phoebe> oh, pervert parade? 
<s>  no... 
<phoebe> oh, ode to a pubic hair? 
<s> stop!  
<phoebe> oh god! is that veal? 
<s> mom, i thought i told you... phoebe's a vegetarian. 
<s> oh! 
<phoebe> oh no, no, no, no... that's okay, that's okay... i mean, i'm... i am a vegetarian... except for veal... yeah no, veal i love... 
<s> phoebe you don't have to eat... 
<phoebe> no, no, no, i actually it's any baby animals babies... you know... especially veal... and this, this nice vein of fat running through it...  hmmm... yummy  hmmm...  
<s> so...? what do you think?  
< 
<monica> so you stole that tape from richard's apartment? 
<chandler> whoho ho... listen to the judgement from the porn star! 
<monica> that tape was never meant to be seen by...  joey i would feel more comfortable if i was having this conversation in private. 
<joey>  monica, look... i don't think you and i have any secrets anymore...  not ready to joke about it yet, okay, i see you later.  
<monica> why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it? 
<chandler> because that's who i am, okay? i'm sure a mature man like richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches. 
<monica> is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache? 
<chandler> this is about you and richard. he's clearly not over you. he keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants. 
<monica> isn't that sad? i mean, can you see how pathetic that is? you shouldn't be jealous. you should feel bad for him. 
<chandler> oh, yeah, well, poor richard. y'... i can grow a moustache! 
<monica> chandler, this is not our problem. we've got each other. that's all that matters. 
<chandler> yeah, oh, but i just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air... 
<monica> cowboy boots? i've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life!  
<chandler> oh, good, good. play more, 'cause i wanna see how it ends. 
<monica> that's not me! 
<chandler> what...? that's not you! life is good again! ride 'em cowgirl! 
<monica> that bastard taped over me!  
<chandler> is that a problem? 
<monica> i-it's just so insulting! big spring for a new blank tape, doctor! 
< 
<s> i can't imagine what he sees in her. 
<s> she actually makes me miss that pill-popping ex-wife of his.  oh, hello dear... 
<s> hey, what's going on? 
<s> we were just chit-chatting. how's your friend? 
<s> a little better. 
<s> by the way, do you know who's moving back into town? tom and sue's daughter jen. 
<s> you remember her michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and... single. 
<s> i'm not interested. 
<s> oh, please darling, let's be honest. you can have all the... sailor fun you want with that one, but... let's be real... 
<s> all right, stop! you know, all phoebe has done tonight is trying to get you to like her. and maybe that hasn't been clear all the time, but she did her best. and yeah... she's a little different than you are... 
<s> michael, a pimp spit in her mouth!  
<s> so what? i mean if even i can get past that, it shouldn't bother you. and you don't have to like her. you just have to accept the fact that i do. i mean, if you even can't be civil to the woman i love... 
<s> the woman you what?  
<phoebe> yeah... the woman you what? 
<s> the woman i love...  i love you... which is probably something i shouldn't say for the first time in front of my parents... and tom and sue...who are by the way the most sinfully boring i've ever met in my life... 
<phoebe> i love you too... 
<s> you do? 
<phoebe> yeah...! how great is this...?  
<s> wanna get out of here? 
<phoebe> okay. 
<s> mom, dad, thanks for dinner. 
<phoebe> i had a great time.  it was really top drawer. and here's closet... ta taaa... commercial break

<ross> hell yeah! 
<rachel> so shake it!  
<ross> shake it! 
<rachel> shake it!

<rachel> shake that nasty butt... 
<ross> baby got back  
<rachel> one more time from the top... i like big butts and i cannot lie, you other br...  
<ross> rachel please! that is so inappropriate!  
<monica> hey hon? would you help me get the plates down? 
<chandler> yeah. hey! here's an idea. why don't we use our wedding china today? 
<monica> no, i think we should save our china for something really special...like, if the queen of england comes over. 
<chandler> honey, she keeps cancelling on us...take the hint! 
<monica> what if something gets broken? they're so expensive! 
<chandler> what is the point of having them, if we never use them? 
<monica> ok..but if something gets broken, and then the queen comes over... 
<chandler> i will explain it to her. 
<monica> oh yeah! like i'm going to let you talk to the queen. 
<joey> wow the parade is really good this year/man those horses can crap!  
<chandler> muskogee? that's like four hours from tulsa! woo hoo! soap, days of our lives.  
<joey> oh my god!!

<joey> yeah!! i forgot i'm supposed to be there! i can't believe i forgot! i usually write stuff like this down on my arm!  
<joey> oh! stupid long sleeves! 
<chandler> what are you going to do? 
<joey>  i guess i'm going to come up with a really good reason why i wasn't there! the producer is going to be so mad at me...he sat us all down yesterday and said everyone has to be there six am sharp, that means you tribbiani!  like i was some kind of idiot! 
<chandler> well, you proved them wrong. 
<joey> yeah...   
<rachel> oh emma...this is your first thanksgiving...what are you thankful for? mommy's boobies? 
<ross> alot of people are thankful for those!

<rachel> er..it's emma 
<s> it's a girl? 
<ross> hey amy. 
<rachel> oh amy, you remember ross. 
<s> not really. but, you are much cuter than that geeky guy she used to date.  
<ross> that was me.  
<s> no...he was this creepy guy from high school who had this huge crush on her, since like the ninth grade. 
<ross> still me. friend's brother with that bad afro...   
<monica> careful. careful.. careful! 
<chandler> i'll tell you what. for the rest of our lives, i'll be careful, until told otherwise.  
<chandler> wait a minute. this isn't the china we picked out... 
<monica> i know! after you left the store i chose different ones. 
<chandler> why? 
<monica> well, no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me. 
<chandler> oh suddenly flowers are feminine? 
<phoebe> hey everybody! happy thanksgiving! 
<joey> phoebs!  
<phoebe> hey what's going on, joe? 
<joey> listen, i...i...i... need a good lie. 
<phoebe> oh...ok..how about the whole man walking on the moon thing? y'know? you can.. you can see the strings people! 
<joey> no..nonono...i need a good lie to explain why i wasn't at the work thing today. 
<phoebe> oo. honey, you stink at lying. 
<joey> wha? i do not! 
<phoebe> oh really? let me ask you something. yesterday at the coffeehouse, i went to the bathroom, and when i came back, my muffin was gone. who took it? 
<joey> somebody opened the door...to the coffeehouse, and a, raccoon , came running in and went straight for your muffin i said "hey! don't eat that! that's phoebe's!" and he said... he said "joey, you stink at lying". what am i going to do? 
<phoebe> don't worry, don't worry. we'll come up with a good lie. i'll help you practice it. 
<joey> oh that'd be great. that'd be great. thank you. 
<phoebe> sure. what was the work thing?  
<phoebe> pick up grandma at the airport? 
<joey> ohhh man!   
<rachel> oh she's precious... 
<s> do you ever worry she'll get your real nose? 
<rachel> amy...yes i do, i really do.   
<s> hello? yeah! hang on, one second.  can i take this upstairs? 
<ross> sure! we don't live there but... 
<s> seriously? it's just these rooms? i..thought you were a doctor. 
<rachel> yeah, no ross has a phd. 
<s> ewwww!  
<rachel> god! she is...unbelievable! 
<ross> i know! i mean a phd is just as good as an md. 
<rachel> yeah, oh sure ross yeah! if i have a heart attack at a restaurant, i want you there with your fossil brush!  
<s> stupid thanksgiving! 
<rachel> what? what? what happened? 
<s> my boyfriend cancelled on me. i mean i, i finally find a real relationship someone that i can spend this day with, and then his wife comes back into town. i swear, it's, it's, not even worth dating married guys. 
<ross> don't say that! 
<s> i was so looking forward to this. it was going to be such a beautiful thanksgiving. we were going to have sushi... 
<rachel> oh amy...don't cry. erm. ross? could i talk to you in private? 
<ross> sure you wanna go upstairs? or...  
<rachel> erm look. i was thinking, if it's ok with monica, i would like to invite amy, to thanksgiving. 
<ross> you know i think that's a great idea. it'll be like the pilgrims being in the indian's syphillis. 
<rachel> look, i know she's a little tough to take...but she has no where else to go. and she's my sister. alright? and she's emma's aunt? and i'd like them to bond... 
<ross> ok...fine. but i don't want them bonding too much. i don't want her telling emma she needs a nose job. 
<rachel> well! ross, you know what? she may need one we're just going to have to make our peace with that.  
<rachel> hi!! 
<rachel> hey you guys! this is my sister amy...this is chandler, joey, phoebe and you know mon! 
<s> oh my god! you're on days of our lives! 
<joey> yeah! 
<s> wow! they must put alot of make-up on you. away as chandler pats his back.] 
<monica> hi.  
<s> yeah, i thi, think so.  it's nice to meet you emma.. 
<s> ooo! that's a funny noise!  
<joey> phoebs! i still need some help here. 
<phoebe> oh! right ok. erm...ok..so it's not just the lie you tell, but it's the way you tell it for example, if you look down on the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying. 
<joey> oh...i don't know why this is so hard for me...y'know what i mean? lying is basically just acting, and i am a terrific actor! 
<phoebe> you are a  terrific actor! 
<s> hey! where's the baby? 
<rachel> oh we just put her down for a nap. 
<s> listen, i was just thinking. you know what would be incredible? if you guys died! 
<ross> thank you amy! 
<s> no, no, then i would get the baby! i mean you know, it'd be just like a movie, like at first i wouldn't know what to do with her, then i would rise to the occasion, and then i get a make-over and then i get married? 
<s> that's a great movie!  
<s> now listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything, cos you know, you'd be dead. but, i was thinking about changing her name...i'm just not really a big fan of emily. 
<ross> emma. 
<phoebe> phoe-be!  
<rachel> honey, i don't know how to tell you this but, erm...but if something were to happen to ross or myself...erm...you wouldn't get the baby. 
<s> well, who would? 
<ross> well, we haven't officially asked them yet, but, we would want monica and chandler. 
<chandler> i can't believe you want us to raise emma! 
<monica> yeah, oh my god..i'm so moved. 
<s> i don't believe this. hold on a second. you guys die...and i don't get your baby??? 
<rachel> amy, see, we're alot closer to monica and chandler. we see them everyday, and truthfully, honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby. 
<s> connected? i mean...to what? she's a lump! 
<chandler> you know guys, i gotta say this, this means so much to me. that you'd trust me, with your child...i mean, we all know that monica and i have been trying to have a baby of our own, and i've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but...that you two....that you two... 
<s> this guy? seriously?   
<monica> ok...it's time for dinner! erm...everyone, we're using our fancy china, and erm, it's very expensive...so pleaaase be careful.  
<ross> whoa.....whoa...... whoa! 
<monica> ok er...just to be clear, comedy with the plates, will not be well-received.   
<joey> hey!! how come my plate is less fancy than everyone elses? do you not trust me with the fancy plate? 
<monica> no!!! honey that's...that's a special plate! see, it's a game! whoever gets that plate, wins! 
<s> y'know, this is such a slap in the face. i mean, i'm your sister, and you'd give your baby to these....strangers over me. 
<rachel> monica, is ross' sister. 
<s> no....ross' sister was really fat. 
<monica> that was me. 
<s> er...no. she was this really dorky girl in high school, who used to follow rachel around like a puppy... 
<rachel> amy!! you've got to stop doing that.  
<monica> ok...listen er...i know that you're having a little bit of a family crisis but you don't have to take it out on the plates! in fact i think, that, everyone, should erm...cut their food like this!  now, see? this way you protect the plates, and let's face it. you have fun. 
<s> ok, how bout this. if you guys die, and the crazy plate lady dies...then do i get the baby. 
<chandler> no...if crazy plate lady... if monica dies...then...i would get emma...right? 
<rachel> well, actually.... 
<chandler> actually what? 
<ross> er...it's just that in that case...then erm...emma would go to my parents. 
<chandler> what??! 
<s> hurts doesn't it?  
<joey> er... who has to die for me to get her?  
<chandler> so, if monica's not around, i'm not good enough to raise emma? 
<ross> no, that's not what we are saying... 
<joey> yeah! he's lying he looked down!  
<chandler> what...what is wrong with me? am i, am i incompetent? because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you! 
<rachel> honey, you're taking this the wrong way. we think you're going to be a wonderful parent! it's just that, you're more the...y'know, fun parent. 
<ross> yeah! and we wanna make sure that emma also has someone like monica, who's more of a disciplinarian...someone who can be firm, and strict. 
<monica> that's not how you see me is it? 
<phoebe> no, you're all about the fun.  
<chandler> look, i may not know alot about babies, but you really think i'm not capable? 
<ross> no...you both are equally capable. it's just that you're strongest, when you're together. 
<chandler> ok, so if we both had emma, and i die  she'd have to give her up. 
<ross> sure! monica would have to give her up. 
<joey> i lie better than that right?  
<chandler> so...so let me get this straight. so my two friends die, i get emma, then my wife dies, then emma the one-tiny-ray-of-hope left in my life, gets taken away from me? 
<s> there's your movie!  
< 
<monica> hey...there you are. you disappeared after dinner. 
<chandler> oh, did somebody miss me? is there a child to raise poorly? 
<monica> ross and rachel don't know what they're talking about! i mean it's not like they're so responsible. emma as a product of a bottle of murlo and a five-year-old condom. 
<chandler> y'know but they're right. i'm not a strong father-figure and i never will be. 
<monica> no....you learn these things. you grow into it. 
<chandler> yeah, but it's not who i am. everything they said is exactly why i was worried about having a kid. and it's true! and, look, everybody knows it. 
<monica> i don't know it! i want to have a kid with you because i think you're going to be an amazing dad. at the fun parts and at the hard parts. 
<chandler> oh yeah, well, can you picture me saying, "go to your room! you're grounded!" 
<monica> can you hear me say you're grounded? 
<chandler> you said that to me last week. 
<monica> how hard is it? no shoes on the furniture!  
<joey> argh. the producer from days of our life left me a message on the machine asking why i wasn't at the parade! they say everybody is very pissed off at me and they all got to meet santa!  
<phoebe> it's ok. i thought of the perfect lie for you. it's easy to remember and it doesn't invite alot of questions. you weren't at the parade, because you had a family emergency. 
<joey> oh...i like that! yeah! i wasn't at the parade because i had a family emergency. 
<phoebe> ooo...what happened? 
<joey> er...my sister's raccoon came.....  
<monica> wha...wait what are you doing? 
<joey> setting the table. 
<phoebe> i thought it might be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too. 
<monica> oh..how nice! maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress 
<ross> hey dude, you ok? sorry bout before. 
<chandler> no, no that's ok. you're totally right i don't know anything about disciplining a child. but...you did hurt my feelings...so, i want you to know that if i die, you don't get joey.   
<s> in case you haven't noticed, i'm not talking to you.  
<s> you know, this is...this is classic rachel. 
<rachel> oh yeah...yeah, right. remember in high school, when i died, and didn't give you my baby? 
<s> this, might be my one chance to have a child, rachel. i mean, you know that i have been so busy focussing on my career... 
<s> erm...i'm a decorator??  
<rachel> you decorate dad's office and now you're a decorator? ok! i went to the zoo yesterday...now i'm a koala bear! 
<s> why can't you ever be supportive? 
<rachel> suppor...you wanna talk supportive? you didn't even come and visit me when i was in the hospital having the baby! 
<s> oh yeah? well, you didn't come to see me in the hospital when i was getting my lips done! 
<rachel> i did the first time!  
<rachel> and...and you know what? you wanna know why i'm not giving emily to you? 
<ross> emma. 
<rachel> oh! whoose side are you on!/ i'm not giving you emma because there is no way, you could handle the responsibility of a child. 
<s> well, how hard could it be? you do it. 
<joey> ooooooooohoohooo....... 
<s> do i know why you don't want me to have the baby? because you don't want me to be happy! you have always been jealous of me. 
<rachel> jealous of what? of your lack of responsibility? your...your inmaturity? your total disregard for other people's feelings? 
<s> er...to name a few!  
<s> y'know, you're just, you've always been like this. you just...you had to have everything and i couldn't have anything. like in junior high, when you stole timmy from me...i mean do you even realize how much that hurt me? 
<rachel> timmy was my boyfriend! and you made out with him!! 
<s> oh come on, that was twenty years ago, get over it. 
<rachel> oh god! i cannot believe...i cannot believe that i invited you here today! 
<s> yeah, y'know what i cannot believe? that my so-called sister, gets a thirty percent discount from ralph lauren and i still have to pay retail? 
<rachel> hahah......ahhahah...it's forty-five! 
<s> you...bitch.  
<s> you just think you're so perfect. with your new baby, and your...your small apartment.  
<s> well, let me tell you something. your baby? isn't even that cute.  
<ross> too far amy. too far. 
<rachel> you take that back. 
<s> no! 
<rachel> take it back! 
<s> no! what are you going to do? make me? 
<rachel> hey...man! i work out! 
<s> so do i! 
<rachel> i do karates. 
<s> i do yoga. 
<rachel> bring it on!  
<monica> put the plates back in the boxes! put the plates back in the boxes! 
<rachel> did you just push me? 
<s> uh yeah! i think i did. 
<rachel> alright that's it!  
<monica> forget the bubble wrap! there isn't time!  
<rachel> crazy crazy crazy crazy!   
<phoebe> oh my god! shouldn't we stop this? 
<joey> what are you? out of your mind? let's toss some jell-o on them!  
<rachel> ew! ew! gross gross!  
<chandler> alright! that is it! this is our apartment and you cannot behave this way. now if you can't act your age, then you shouldn't be here at all. now, those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones i picked out...but they're very important to monica...and i want you to apologize to her right now. 
<s> i'm sorry. 
<rachel> mon...i'm so sorry. 
<chandler> ok...that's better. now i want you to apologize to each other, and mean it. 
<s> by the way, that fight was totally arousing. 
<ross> dude, well done! you know what? if i die, and rachel dies, and monica dies, you can totally take care of emma. 
<chandler> oh yeah? well, thanks! 
<ross> so, so, now do i get joey? 
<chandler> ok...but you should know, he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.  
<rachel> are you ok mon? 
<monica> uh huh. these things happen. i mean it's just a plate, it's not like somebody died. 
<phoebe> it's alright...you can mourn.  
<monica> i'm going to go to joey's and get pies. 
<joey> actually, not pies, it's just pie. 
<monica> i don't care. oh my god, i've lost the will to scold. 
<rachel> look, amy...i got a little out-of-control over there. erm...and i'm sorry. you're my sister and erm...if it really means that much to you... 
<s> so you're going to give me the baby? 
<rachel> no, i was going to let you use my ralph lauren discount. 
<s> you are not going to regret this!  
<rachel> she needs changing... 
<chandler> oh no no! i'll get her. i'm super-confident, totally responsible and fourth in line to raise emma./ i'll be right there emma! just let me get my trusty diaper bag here.  
<chandler> well, what do you know? i guess, i'll be the one who dies first.   
<phoebe> hey. does monica know about her broken plates yet? 
<chandler> nope. 
<phoebe> broke em all huh? 
<chandler> yup. 
<phoebe> you going to tell her? 
<chandler> nope.  
<chandler> hey! so, i'm gonna put the plates back. y'know i think you're right...i don't think we should use these plates again for a long time. 
<monica> like only if the queen comes? 
<chandler> maybe not even then!  
<joey> hey! i did it! i called my producer, i told him i had a family emergency, he totally bought it. thanks for teaching me how to lie phoebs.

<joey> hey! open the door! whats going on?  
<monica> hi! 
<joey> why are you dressed like that?

<phoebe> woah! oh my god! i love things! what happened? 
<rachel> well, um, first he told me that he liked how i looked, and then, erm, we had a little, erm, eye contact. 
<phoebe> eye contact? 
<rachel> uh huh. 
<phoebe> i hope you were using protection.

< 
<monica> chandler, you have to tell joey that you are not in tulsa. 
<chandler> dont you think its better for him to think that youre cheating on me than for him to think that i'm cheating on him?  i heard it! 
<monica> i dont want him to think that i'm having an affair. 
<chandler> alright. ive got a plan. ill go down the fire escape 
<monica> yes. because all good plans start with ill just go down the fire escape  
<chandler> hear me out, woman! ill go down the fire escape, then ill wait for a while. then, when i come back up the stairs, itll just be like i got back from tulsa. then, joey and i will come in here and see that there is no guy in here. 
<monica> arent you afraid that joeys going to figure all this out?  i heard it!  
<chandler> just gonna wait for a little while. 
<monica> scary pigeons back? 
<chandler> its huge!

<rachel> i dont know. he was cute and he liked me. it was an impulse. 
<phoebe> but what about ross? what about your moment? dont you want to talk to ross about it? 
<rachel> no, no, cos i know exactly how the conversation is going to go. hey ross, you know, i think that we had a moment before  yeah, um, me too  well, but im not sure i really wanna do anything about it!  yeah, um, me, um, neither.  ross, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how were really feeling?  yeah, that works for me, um, um.

<s> i cant do that. 
<phoebe>  he says that he cant do that 
<rachel> oh, give me.  hi, mike! hi, listen, i know this is a lot to ask, but you know what. if you do this, ah, phoebe will do anything you want. seriously, im talking dirty stuff.

<joey>  wow, that was great! you really wrote that? 
<phoebe>  uh-huh. 
<chandler>  say goodbye elves, i'm off to tulsa. 
<monica> i can't believe you're not gonna be here for christmas. 
<ross> you're really not coming back? 
<chandler> yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. if i don't get it done, i'll be fired. 
<monica> it's so unfair, you don't even like your job! 
<chandler> so, who does? 
<phoebe> oh, i like my job. 
<joey> i *love* my job. 
<rachel> yeah, i can't *wait* to go back to work. 
<ross> i can't get *enough* dinosaurs! 
<chandler> i'm sorry i won't be here. 
<monica> it's just... it's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, i understand. 
<chandler> thanks.  i'll see you new year's day. 
<monica>  you're not gonna be here new year's eve?? 
<chandler> did i not mention that? 
<monica> no! 
<chandler>  --- opening credits --- 
< 
<chandler> all right everybody, i know that it's christmas eve and you'd rather be with your familys, but there's *no* call  for writing "screw you, mr. bing!" on the back of my chair!  -- by the way, you can all call me chandler.  
<s> hey! 
<s> hey. 
<chandler> hey. where've you been? 
<s> i was, uh, checking out that insurance company's christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and i just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- so i stole ther ham.  
<chandler>  you hear that? you may not be with your familys, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here. 
<s> my kid's in a play right now. 
<chandler> y'know what, i know what will cheer you guys up!  i had a little talk with the boys in new york, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little christmas bonus may be in order. 
<s>  "a donation has been made in your name to the new york city ballet". 
<chandler> well, that's like money in your pocket! - alright look, you want me to say it? this sucks. being here sucks! this work sucks! 
<s> *now* it feels like christmas. 
<chandler> i'm sorry. hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your familys tonight. i have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. and then tomorrow morning, you get to have christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to. 
<s> you can come to my house! 
<chandler> haha, no thanks! 
<s> that was a nice pep-talk. 
<chandler> oh, thanks! i'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker. 
<s> so, if you were home right now, what would you be doing? 
<chandler> typical christmas-y stuff, you know? our holidays are pretty traditional...  
< 
<phoebe> so here is a, a very special holiday song that i wrote for some very important people to me.  "went to the store, sat on santa's lap. asked him to bring my friends all kinds of crap. said all you need is to write them a song. now, you haven't heard it yet, so don't try to sing along. no, don't sing along. monica, moncia, have a happy hanukkah. saw santa clause, he said hello to ross. and please tell joey, christmas will be snowy! and rachel and chandler, have err-umm-glander!!" happy holidays, everybody!  
< 
<rachel> okay, pheebs, you look in the kitchen, i will look in the back closet. 
<chandler> i can save you time ladies, i'm right here. 
<phoebe> yeah, chandler why don't you take a walk? this doesn't concern you. 
<rachel> we are looking for our christmas presents from monica. 
<chandler> what? that's terrible! 
<phoebe> no-no, we do it every year! 
<chandler> oh well, that, that makes it not terrible. 
<phoebe> no, yeah, we never find them! she's always best at us, that wily... minx. 
<rachel> don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to joey's and search, ok? 
<chandler> no not okay, you can't look for monica's presents! 
<phoebe> oh no, we have to! 
<chandler> no, you don't have to, and you can't because i, i live here too. 
<phoebe> well then, you should look with us. 
<chandler> why? 
<rachel> chandler, aren't you worried about what to get monica for christmas? 
<chandler> no, i have a great idea for a present for her. 
<phoebe> oh, that's it?  a great idea! oh yeah. 
<rachel> chandler, that's not enough. i mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? and you've just gotten her one great present? i mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. why would you do that to her chandler? why? why? 
<chandler> if i help, we can find 'em faster! 
<rachel> that's right!  
<phoebe> ooh ooh, we have a live one! 
<rachel> oh, it's a macy's bag!  
<rachel> oh. 
<phoebe> ooh, who's it for? 
<rachel>  "dear losers, do you really think i'd hide presents under the couch? 
<s> chandler, i knew they'd break you."  
< 
<joey> rach, these are for you. 
<rachel> wiper blades. i don't even have a car. 
<joey> no, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do. 
<chandler> ok, pheebs, your turn. 
<phoebe> ahh, toilet seat covers! is that what you were doing while i was getting gas? 
<joey> uh-huh. 
<phoebe> you guuuyys. 
<joey> and for ross, mr. sweet-tooth. 
<ross> you got me a cola drink? 
<chandler> and, a lemon lime. 
<ross> well this, this is too much, i feel like i should get you another sweater. 
<chandler> and last but not least.  
<joey> they're ribbed for *your* pleasure.  
< 
<ross> ooh, hey ben, what if the holiday armadillo told you all about the festival of lights? 
<s> cool! 
<ross> yeah!

<chandler> what? 
<monica> okay ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and santa, the armadillo and i have a little talk in the kitchen? there's a sentence i'd never thought i'd say.  
<ross>  what are you doing? 
<chandler> you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a santa costume, so i borrowed one from a guy at work! 
<ross> thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave. 
<chandler> why? 
<ross> because, i'm finally getting him excited about hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it. 
<chandler> but i didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly. 
<ross> i'm sorry chandler, but this, this is really important to me. 
<chandler> fine, i'll give the suit back.  
<monica>  hey, you think, you can keep it another night?  
<chandler> santa? really? 
<monica> yeah, is that okay? 
<chandler> did your dad ever dress up like santa? 
<monica> no. 
<chandler> then it's okaaay!  
< 
<chandler> you know what, everybody? go home. you should be with your familys. it's bad enough that we're working new year's eve.  did i not tell *anyone* about new year's eve? -- alright, look, go! go home, okay? merry christmas! go.  
<chandler> good, god's speed, good people!  you're not gonna go?

<chandler> be-low me! 
<joey> ahh, wait, is wendy the runner-up miss oklahoma? 
<monica> *what*?? 
<chandler> well, she... she didn't win... 
<monica> alright, well, maybe i should let you and the second prettiest girl in oklahoma get back to work. 
<chandler> well, second prettiest that year; i mean, of *all* the girls in oklahoma, she's probably... 
<rachel>  oh chandler, stop talking! 
<chandler> honey, there's really nothing to worry about. 
<monica> okay. 
<chandler> i'm serious! 
<monica> okay! 
<chandler> merry christmas.

< 
<chandler>  the wife says "hi!". 
<s> ah. fun conversation? 
<chandler> ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and i are alone, that something is gonna happen. 
<s> huh? really? -- hm, that'd be so terrible?  
<chandler> this is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.  
< 
<chandler> whoa-ho, back off, missy!  
<s>  ...missy? 
<chandler> i don't know; i'm not used to girls making passes at me! ...  wait a minute... am i sexy in oklahoma? 
<s> you are to me...  
<chandler>  no,... no...  no!  look, i'm, i'm married! 
<s> so? i'm married.  
<chandler> i'm *happily* married. 
<s> oh. what's *that* like? 
<chandler> right. so, i'm sorry... 
<s> seriously? happily married. so that phone call before, that was ... happy? 
<chandler> well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. right on money! ... you know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. but, what i have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us. 
<s> okay, let me ask you something is so great, then why are you spending christmas with me?   
< 
<chandler> i mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight! 
<monica> really? 
<chandler> you kidding? you're the most beautiful woman in most rooms...  whoa! whoa! whoa! what's going on? you and i just made out! you and i are making out? 
<monica> well, not anymore. 
<chandler> but we don't do that. 
<monica> i know, i just thought it would be fun. 
<chandler> how drunk are you? 
<monica> drunk enough that i know i wanna do this. not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage. 
<chandler>  that's the perfect amount! 
<monica> okay!  
<monica>  y'know what's weird? 
<chandler> what? 
<monica> this doesn't feel weird! 
<chandler> i know. 
<monica> you're a really good kisser. 
<chandler> well, i have kissed over four women.  do you wanna get under the covers? 
<monica> hm-hmm! 
<chandler> okay!  
<monica> wow! you are really fast! 
<chandler> it bodes well for me that speed impresses you. 
<monica> we're gonna see each other naked. 
<chandler> yep! 
<monica> do you wanna do it at the same time? 
<chandler> count of three? 
<monica> one! 
<chandler> two! 
<monica> two! 
<s> three!  
<chandler> well i think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined. 
<monica> eh, we weren't that close anyway! 
<chandler> eh!   
< 
<chandler> so, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man? 
<monica> well uh, you and i are just goofing around, i thought, why not just goof around with him. 
<chandler> y'know, i don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... well, i have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. but if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. i am *so* bad at this. 
<monica> i think you're better than you think you are. 
<chandler> really? okay, so... 
<monica>  know when to stop. 
<chandler> y'know, i sensed that i should stop. so we're okay? 
<monica> yeah. (they kiss and as she starts to leave, chandler starts 
<chandler> right!  
< 
<monica> i can't get married until i get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue. 
<chandler> okay, all right, all right, all right! okay!  okay, here's something, here's something blue and new. 
<monica> you're so efficient. i love you! 
<chandler> let's go!  
<monica> no-no-no, wait! we need something old! 
<chandler> oh, okay, i have condom in my wallet that i've had since i was twelve. 
<monica> that'll work! 
<chandler> i don't think so. 
<monica> okay, now we just need something borrowed! 
<chandler>  here just...take this.  
<monica> that's stealing! 
<chandler> no, we'll-we'll bring it back! just put it under your dress.  
<monica> ohh.  
<chandler> okay, one thing at a time.   
< 
<monica> listen umm, i've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. i mean, you work, you work really hard for that. 
<chandler> ehh. 
<monica> eh, you work for that. 
<chandler> look, i thought about it too, and i'm sorry. i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding. 
<monica> you do?! 
<chandler> yeah, i'm putting my foot down. yeah look, when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do. 
<monica> oh, you're so sweet.  oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff? 
<chandler> eh, forget about the future and stuff! so we only have two kids, y'know? we'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college. 
<monica> you thought about that? 
<chandler> yeah. 
<monica> how many kids were we gonna have? 
<chandler> uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy. 
<monica> what else did you think about? 
<chandler> well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old. 
<monica>  y'know what? i-i don't want a big, fancy wedding. 
<chandler> sure you do. 
<monica> no, i want everything that you just said. i want a marriage. 
<chandler> you sure? 
<monica> uh-hmm. 
<chandler> i love you so much. 
<monica> i love you.  
< 
<rachel>  oohh, i love it! 
<ross> really? you're not gonna return it? 
<rachel> well, not  second!

<monica> okay, fine. let's talk about snow. -- do you think it's snowing in tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?

<chandler> turns out they can't fire me. because i quit. 
<monica> what? 
<ross> what, you, you really quit your job? 
<chandler> yeah! it's a stupid job, and i could not stand leaving you. and why should i be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do? 
<rachel> what do you really want to do? 
<chandler>  i have *not* thought this through! 
<monica> oh my god! 
<chandler> i know, i, i should have talked to you first about it. 
<monica> no, i think that this is what you wanna do, i think it's great! 
<chandler> thanks! 
<phoebe> chandler, your being here is the best christmas present i could have ever imagined.

<monica> well, i just lost my erection. 
<chandler> i mean, what am i supposed to do with myself? 
<monica> you're supposed to find your passion in life. you can be whatever you wanna be now. it's exciting. 
<chandler> but it's all so overwhelming. i don't know where to start. 
<monica> hey, wait a second. i can help you with this. you just need to be organized. we can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. there could be folders and files! 
<chandler> hey! this is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off! 
<monica> i know!!! my erection is back! opening titles 
< 
<joey>  thank you! 
<phoebe> joey, can i have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin? 
<joey> okay. phoebe thank you.  thank you! 
<joey> pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry italian? 
<phoebe> i'm sorry, it's just, i'm a little short on cash. 
<joey> if you want i could loan you some money? 
<phoebe> oh no, no, no. i learned never to borrow money from friends. no, that's why richard dreyfuss and i don't speak anymore. 
<joey> oh, hey, how about this? wanna be an extra on my show? 
<phoebe> you could do that? 
<joey> yeah, yeah. the pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need. 
<phoebe> oh my god, i'm gonna be on tv! 
<joey> okay, now. i gotta tell you, being on tv isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think. 
<phoebe> oh, really? 
<joey> no it is awesome!  
<ross> hi guys. 
<phoebe> wow! hey, why are you all dressed up? 
<ross> rachel and i are bringing emma to ralph lauren today to introduce her to everyone. doesn't she look cute? 
<joey> she sure does. why does she have a pink bow taped to her head? 
<rachel> well, because if one more person says "what a cute little boy" i'm gonna whip them with a car antenna! 
<ross> i think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? she's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and a-line skirts. can i get a blue bow? 
< 
<monica>  okay, i have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision. 
<chandler> how long was i in there? 
<monica> okay. let us start with the a's. advertising. 
<chandler> wait. advertising! that's a great idea! 
<monica> don't you want to look through the rest? 
<chandler> i don't think i have to hear the rest. advertising makes perfect sense. sorry you had to waste all this time, though. 
<monica> you call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? ooh, now i get to use my shredder! 
<chandler> i mean, i can write slogans. i mean, how hard can it be, right? "cheese. it's milk that you chew." "crackers. because your cheese needs a buddy." "a grape. because who can get a water melon in your mouth?" 
<monica> i got one. "socks. because your family's feet deserve the best." 
<chandler> honey? leave it to the pros. 
<monica> i actually know someone in advertising. i grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. maybe i can get him to meet you? give me the phone. 
<chandler> "the phone. bringing you closer to people...who have phones." 
<monica> "marriage. it's not for everybody." 
< 
<rachel> that went well. almost everybody knew that she was a girl. 
<ross> yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread. 
<rachel> i'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff .  who the hell are you!? 
<s> who the hell are you? 
<rachel> i'm the hell person whose office this is! 
<ross> good one, rach. 
<s> i'm gavin mitchell, the person who's taken over your job. 
<rachel> excuse me? 
<s> oh, your baby's so cute. why did you put a pink bow on a boy? 
< 
<phoebe> joey, look at me! i'm a nurse! 
<joey> yes you are. i think it may be time for my sponge bath. sorry, i'm just so used to hitting on the extras. so, are you excited about your scene? 
<phoebe> yeah! but i'm a little shaky and nervous. 
<joey> oh, relax. don't be. you'll be fine, you'll be fine. they'll probably just make you stand in the back. 
<s> okay, okay, okay!  you. here, come here, here. you're gonna take this tray, you're gonna stay on this yellow mark. you're gonna move on "action!" you're gonna walk over to the operating table. you're gonna stop on that blue mark, you're gonna put the tray down. don't walk too fast! but don't doddle. 
<phoebe> okay, now. what? 
<s> and...action!!  
<s> cut! cut! 
<phoebe> i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry. i'm just a little nervous. 
<s> well, don't be. 
<phoebe> okay, that helps. 
<s> and...action!  
<s> cut! 
<joey> hey, you know what? don't worry, pheebs! it usually takes me three takes too!  alright, eight. 
<s> and...action!  
< 
<s> so, do you have any other question about advertising? 
<chandler> no, no. but let me show you what i can do. "bagels and donuts. round food for every mood." 
<s> monica warned me you might do that. i actually think we might have something for you at the agency. 
<chandler> really? that's great! 
<s> it's an unpaid internship. 
<chandler> it's funny. when you said "unpaid" it sounded like you said "unpaid." 
<s> come on now. monica has a good job. and it's not like you have a family to support. 
<chandler> actually, we're trying, and i don't think monica's gonna wanna postpone it. we're supposed to have sex tonight. actually, she's probably at home naked right now. i tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. i can just picture her on the bed right now. 
<s> stop! 
<s> okay. 
< 
<rachel> wait a minute! what do you mean, you're taking over my job? 
<s> well, while you were on your baby vacation i was doing your job. 
<rachel> a vacation? my idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw. 
<s> clearly you've never been to sandles paradise island. 
<rachel> alright! don't get too comfortable there, because i'm back in two weeks! and i want everything back to the way it was. i can't say that i care too much for the way you've rearranged my office. 
<s> i can't say i care too much for that smell you've brought in with you. 
<rachel> excuse me? 
<ross> rach we have a code brown situation. 
<rachel> can you please, please take care of it for me? 
<ross> alright, but you have to do one sometime. 
<rachel> let me just get this straight! so i go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job? 
<s> well, there was talk of shutting down ralph lauren all together. 
<rachel> that's right. you're very cheeky for a temp. 
<s> i'm not a temp. i was transferred here from another department. 
<rachel> oh yeah, what department was that? the jerk department? 
<s> oh, they didn't tell me about your quick wit. 
<rachel> did they mention that i'm rubber and you're glue? 
<rachel> oh, hi mr. zelner. us we weren't sure what we were gonna do. but then, gavin to the rescue. super gavin! 
<rachel> that's great. so now, super gavin, when i come back where are you planning on flying off to? 
<s> well, that's up to mr. zelner. i'm sure he will make the right decision. 
<rachel>  oh, wow. super ass-kissing power. 
<rachel> today. 
<s> you said two weeks. 
<rachel> no, i said today! see, for a superhero, not so much with the listening. 
< 
<joey> hey. 
<phoebe> hey. so, what did he say? 
<joey> well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so i'm gonna replace friend doesn't get her puppy act together, i'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass." 
<phoebe> i'm sorry, i can't do this. i'm not an actor. 
<joey> that's right, you're not. you're a nurse. you're nurse with tray. 
<phoebe> joey. 
<joey> no, no. nurse with tray doesn't know joey, she doesn't have time for friends. she gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die! 
<phoebe> who dies? 
<joey>  man with eye patch! you get in there and you do your job. 
<phoebe> yes, doctor. 
<joey> okay. 
<s> okay, let's try this one more time. 
<phoebe> hang in there, man with eye patch, your tray is coming! 
<s> and...action! 
<phoebe>  yes, i did it!!! i nailed it!!! yay! what's next? 
<s> the rest of the scene. 
<phoebe> okay, from the top, people! 
< 
<rachel> listen. sudden change of plans. my maternity leave just ended. they told me that if i didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me. 
<ross> what? no, that's illegal. i'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even... 
<rachel> alright, alright. calm down norma rae. they didn't actually say that. i'm just afraid if i don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out. 
<ross> what about emma? we don't have a nanny. 
<rachel> i know. you know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. can you please just take care of her for today? 
<ross> absolutely. just give me your breast and we'll be on our way. 
<rachel> come on, i don't know what else to do. 
<ross> fine, fine.  we'll have fun, won't we? yes, we will, yes we will.  
<rachel> ross? 
<ross> huh? 
<rachel> you're pretty. 
< 
<chandler> whatever i decide to do, i'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. it's gonna be a while before i make a living at it. maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family. 
<ross> so you have to tell monica you don't want to have a baby right now? 
<chandler> yeah. 
<ross>  good-bye. 
<monica>  okay, it's baby time. pants off bing.  didn't see you there geller. 
<chandler> yeah, ross is here so... 
<ross> yeah, and i was really hoping that i could hang out. what do you feel like doing? 
<monica> we're gonna have sex. 
<ross> i don't feel like having sex. maybe we can watch a movie or something. 
<monica> let me put it this way. we're having sex whether you're here or not. 
<ross> pants off bing! 
< 
<rachel> alright. now that i'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to? 
<s> well, i've changed your screensaver from that picture of *nsync. 
<rachel> hey, they were popular when i left! 
<s> also, i've just been working on this big presentation for tomorrow. 
<rachel> well, i should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed? 
<s> that's gonna take weeks. why don't just let me take care of the presentation? 
<rachel> oh, no no no no. i see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. okay, i've had it for five years, and i know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up! 
<s> fine. 
<rachel>  oh god. you've totally messed with the back support of my chair. how do you fix this? 
<s> hey, you've been here five years, you figure it out. 
<rachel> fine, i will.  alright, fill me in! 
< 
<ross> hey. 
<chandler> hey. 
<ross> you have a blue tie that would go with this? emma spit up on mine. 
<chandler> oh, yeah. but you have to give it back if i get a job. of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits. 
<monica>  hi, good morning lover. i gotta say after last night, i'm a little weak in the knees. 
<ross> here's an idea. you walk into a room...take a quick scan! 
<monica>  sorry.  but i kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night. 
<chandler> oh god, i have to tell you something. you're not pregnant. 
<monica> what are you talking about? 
<chandler> that thing that i have to do to make a baby. i faked it. 
<monica> what!? you faked it? 
<ross> you know what? i don't need a tie. i mean, it's better, open collar. you know, it's more casual  
< 
<phoebe> joey, listen. i can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. yesterday i was a nurse, and today i'm a waitress at a cafe? 
<joey> oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. it's okay. 
<phoebe> well, it's not okay, because i gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. and now suddenly i'm the_waitress? that's gonna confuse my fans. 
<joey> maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress. 
<phoebe> uhuh. because i'm a single mother, supporting my two children. 
<joey> nice. 
<phoebe> wait a minute. dr. drake ramoray and i work at the same hospital. wouldn't i come over to say hi to him? 
<joey> no, no. see, you and drake are having a fight. 
<phoebe> about what? 
<joey> he slept with you and then never called you. 
<phoebe> and i just wanted a new daddy for davy and becky. 
<s> okay, okay, from the top. and...action! 
<s> so, i'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me. 
<s> i'm surprised to, but yet here i am.  
<s> cut, cut! what are you doing!? 
<phoebe> yeah, well, i'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back. 
<s> me too! 
<joey> oh, calm down! she means on the show! we need some new extras around here! 
< 
<s>  wow, you're here already. 
<rachel> yes. emma and i came in a little early to do research on the presentation. i actually made a few changes, but i think i'm caught up on everything. so ask me anything! 
<s> how do you fix the chair? 
<rachel> except that!  oh, hello, mr. zelner. we're all ready for our presentation this afternoon. 
<rachel> what? i can't do that! i have the baby, and ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour. to do it now. ralph needs to leave early today. he's going helicopter shopping. 
<rachel> well, there you go. you win, you win. you get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that i worked here, and then ralph will buy his helicopter, and super gavin will just fly right along side of him! 
<s> you can do the presentation. 
<rachel> no, i can't, i have a baby. 
<s> i'll watch her. 
<rachel> why would you do that? 
<s> because you've worked really hard, and it's your job, and you're a little crazy. 
<rachel> that's really nice. 
<s> i should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable. 
<rachel> then you're not gonna like what's coming.  i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry. thank you, thank you. 
<s> i'm really fine, don't worry, i'm great with children.  gavin mitchell. pleased to meet you. 
< 
<joey> please don't fire my friend. just let me talk to her. 
<s> okay, okay. but this is her last chance. 
<joey> thank you, thank you. how about i do something for you? tomorrow, i'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald? 
<joey> hey, listen pheebs. i was just talking to the_director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit drake, you just wait on the tables? 
<phoebe> i can't do that. i'm an actor. i have a process. 
<joey> you're a masseuse. you have a table with a hole in it. 
<phoebe> wait a minute, i see what's happening here. you're threatened. 
<joey> what? 
<phoebe> yeah, i'm so good in this scene that i'm stealing focus from you. well, rise to the challenge tribianni 'cause i just raised the bar. come join me up here! 
<joey>  yeah, you can fire her, but i would call security, she won't go easy. 
< 
<monica> you faked it? you couldn't have faked it! 
<chandler> oh yes you can. you just make the faces and the noises. 
<monica> guys can fake it? unbelievable. the one thing that's ours! besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby? 
<chandler> that's actually why. look, i'm starting a whole new career now, and i'm not saying that i don't want to have a baby, i'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while. 
<monica> like a month? 
<chandler> or a year? 
<monica> really, you want to wait a year? 
<chandler> it could be less than a year. i mean, you've heard my stuff. "pants. like shorts, but longer."  it'll probably be more than a year. 
<monica> i really wanna have a baby. 
<chandler> yeah, me too. look, i'll just get my old job back. 
<monica> no, i want you to have a job that you love. not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration. 
<chandler> i quit and you learn what i do? 
<monica> it's just, i think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. i mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. there's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but i think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons. 
<chandler> i guess. it's always gonna be scary when we have a baby. 
<monica> it's gonna be really scary. i mean, god. when we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. i mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, i won't have time to clean it. what if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? messes up all the ribbons?! what if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? where will all the ribbons go!?! 
<chandler> should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind? 
<monica> yes, please! 
<chandler> oh, and i promise, i will not fake it this time. 
<monica> i wish i could say the same. i'm a little shook up! closing credits 
< 
<s> i know you botched that operation on purpose. i can't prove it yet, but when i do, you'll be going to jail for murder. i don't care if you are my brother. 
<s> i'm not your brother. 
<s> what about my children drake?! huh!?  no!! no!! no! god! 
< 
<chandler> hey 
<joey> hey. so where's mon? 
<chandler> oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for rachel's birthday party tonight. 
<joey> and you're not helping? 
<chandler> i tried, but apparantly singing "i will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.  
<ross> hey you guys! 
<rachel> shhh don't say that loud, gunther's gonna want to hug me. 
<ross> uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. this is molly . molly, chandler, joey. 
<s> hi.  
<ross> ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy. 
<joey> you damn right i am, i've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes. 
<rachel> ok, you know what, i'm just gonna take her outside. 
<s> no, you stay, i'll do it . 
<rachel> ok, thank you. 
<s> nice to meet you guys . 
<joey> yeah, you too.  
<rachel> oh, wow, molly is just great! 
<ross> yeah. 
<chandler> yes, bravo on the hot nanny. 
<rachel> what? you really think she's hot? 
<chandler> are you kidding? if i wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now. 
<rachel> and joey? 
<joey> how do you think she's doing? 
<rachel> am i the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? ross? 
<ross> eh, i mean, i mena she's not unattractive but hot? i .... 
<rachel> thank you!  
<chandler> now that rachel's gone? 
<rachel> so hot i cried myself to sleep last night.  opening credits 
< 
<phoebe> hey mike, what's the capital of peru? 
<s> lima. 
<phoebe> no. it starts with a "v" and ends with an "x". helpfully with a "to" in the middle. 
<s> you know, kinda think of it, the capital of peru is "vtox".  oh god! oh! 
<phoebe> what? 
<s> ok, i don't want to freak you out or anything, but i think i just saw a rat in your cupboard. 
<phoebe>  oh, whew, no, that's bob. 
<s> what, is he your pet rat? 
<phoebe> well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who i put food out for, you know. kinda like santa. except santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies. 
<s> you can't keep a rat in your appartment! they're extremely unsanitary, and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus. 
<phoebe> what are those? 
<s> i don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. you have to get rid of it! 
<phoebe> ok, fine, if it means that much to you i'll get rid of bob. 
<s> thank you. 
<phoebe> so weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers.  
< 
<rachel> hello. 
<s> hello 
<rachel> gavin, i just wanted to say thank you again for watching emma yesterday during the presentation. i really owe you an appology. 
<s> for what? 
<rachel> well, when we first met, you know, i thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ... 
<s> is this your first appology? 
<rachel> no, i just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. and i-i think you're a really good guy and i'm sorry that i misjudged you.  
<s> good morning! 
<rachel> hello.  but you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, i am just really really happy ...  i'm sorry, obviously heather's ass has something more important to say so i'll just wait 'till it's finished. 
<s> what? 
<rachel> i was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out! 
<s> i wasn't checking her out. i'm in fashion, i was looking at her skirt. or was it pants? i didn't really see what happened below the ass area. 
<rachel> oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep. 
<s> why do you even care if i was looking at her? are you jealous? 
<rachel> oh yeah, i'm jealous. "oh gavin, please, please look at my ass".  stop looking at my ass! i mean, i just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? this is a work environment, she's your subordinate. 
<s> i thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant tag. 
<rachel> that is totally different for two reasons. one - i didn't know that you knew that. and two, i wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship. 
<s> huh. what's tag's last name? 
<rachel> it was ...  oh my god. he didn't have a last name. it was just "tag". you know, like cher, or, you know, moses. 
<s> but it was a deap meaningful relationship. 
<rachel> oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. you are arrogant, you are pompous ... morgan! morgan! tag's last name was morgan! huh! 
<s> it was jones. 
<rachel> yeah well what are you, his boyfriend? 
< 
<joey> man, i wish i had a nanny like you. 
<s> you mean, when you were a baby. 
<joey> sure.  
<monica> would you stop staring at her? 
<chandler> i wasn't staring. i was leering. 
<monica> what's the big deal with her? maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way. 
<ross> yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. you know, when it's right there in your face. me, i like to have to work to find someone attractive. makes me feel like i earned it. 
<chandler> looks like joey is doing allright with her. 
<monica> yeah. hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let joey get the girl for once. 
<s>  i'm gonna take her back to the appartment. 
<ross> ok, i'll be home right after work. ok, by emma-wemma-demma, i love you - wovyou dovyou ... 
<s> bye 
<monica> they've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good. 
<s> i think it's sweet.  
<rachel>  hey, listen, joey, about molly, i really prefer if you didn't go after her. 
<joey> why not? 
<rachel> because it took us months to find a good nanny and i wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away. 
<joey> so, what, you think i'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable?  yeah, sounds about right. 
<ross> come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? just - just forget about her, ok? just, she's off limits. 
<joey> oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? now that you told me i can't have it makes me want her even more! 
<ross> what are you, a child? 
<joey> yes! 
<ross> joey, come on now, for me! please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else. 
<joey> fine.  
<monica>  take me home!  
< 
<phoebe> hey mikey 
<s> hey p 
<phoebe> what are you doing? 
<s> setting rat traps. 
<phoebe> to kill bob?? 
<s> no, no, to test his neck strength. 
<phoebe> no, mike, i don't want to kill him! i thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl. 
<s> ok, ok, i'll throw away the traps. 
<phoebe> i'll find bob, i'll get him. bob?  bob! robert!  oh wait, i think i hear him. oh - oh my god! bob had babies! bob's a mom! 
<s> better think of a new name for him. 
<phoebe> i don't know, i kinda like bob for a girl. 
<s> i don't know, i mean i'm not sure  ... 
<phoebe> oh my god, we killed bob! 
<s> maybe it wasn't bob, maybe it was a mouse. 
<phoebe> suzie?  
< 
<ross> whazzup?? 
<chandler> seriously dude, 3 years ago. 
<ross> listen, can you do me a favor? i'm gonna be out today. can you just keep an eye on joey, make sure nothing happens between him and molly? 
<chandler> you don't trust him? 
<ross> wh - no. some woman who sounded a lot like joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the "hot nanny". 
<chandler> is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? because i could get a job any day now. 
<ross> you do appear right on the cusp of something. come on man, i'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me? 
<chandler> allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. because you know as well as i do that once joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it. 
<ross> well we gotta do something, ok? nannies like her don't grow on trees.  
<chandler> picturing that tree? 
<ross> i am, yes. 
< 
<chandler> where you going, joe?  
<joey> for a walk. 
<chandler> oh. you mind if i join you? 
<joey> actually, that will be long. you know, i really need to organize my thoughts. 
<chandler> your thoughts? plural? 
<joey> allright, fine, i only have one thought! it's about the hot nanny, i gotta see her! 
<chandler> i'm afraid i can't let you do that, joe. 
<joey> now you're telling me i can't see her?? you guys are killing me! she's forbidden fruit! it's like ... like she's the princess and i'm the stable boy ... why are you doing this, huh? did ross tell you not to let me go over there? 
<chandler> yes, as a matter of fact he did, so i can't let you go. 
<joey> huh. interesting. now there are obstacles. hot nanny and me against the world. this is the kind of stuff great novels are made of. 
<chandler> great novels? 
<joey> fine ... mediocre porn 
< 
<s> gavin mitchelle's office. 
<rachel> rachel green's office!! give me that phone!  hello, this is rachel green, how can i help you? uh huh ... ok then ... i'll pass you back to your son  
<s> hey mom! no, that's just my secretary.  
<rachel> um, excuse me gavin, i have a question i need to ask you. 
<s> mom, i'll call you later. yeah.  yes? 
<rachel> if you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror? 
<s> thank god you finally said that, i saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago.  man, i really bug you, don't i? 
<rachel> oh, please, i don't care about you enough to bug me. in fact, from now on, i'm going take the high road. and i'm going be very very nice to you, you "momma's boy", starting right now.  
<monica> hey rach! 
<rachel> hi! 
<monica> ready for your birthday lunch? 
<rachel> yeah i am, i am! oh, but first of all, monica, i would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend gavin mitchelle. 
<s> pleased to meet you. 
<monica> pleased to meet you. so you're coming to rachel's party tonight? 
<rachel> oh no no no no no, gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his mother. 
<s> well i don't mind, i'll cancel. i would never miss my secretary's birthday.  
<rachel> why did you invite him?? i can't stand that guy! 
<monica> you were just being so nice to him! 
<rachel> i was faking it! can't you tell when i'm being fake?  
<rachel> hey, mr philips, nice suit! 
<monica> right there! that was so fake! 
<rachel> shh! 
< 
<rachel>  i still can't believe you invited gavin. allright, he is the last person i want to see. 
<monica> oh, you're welcome for the party. i'm glad you're having a good time. 
<rachel> god, i hope he doesn't show up. of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me. 
<monica> does he? 
<rachel> what? 
<monica> maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. it's like in first grade when skippy langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me? 
<rachel> oh, monica, you think skippy liked you? honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over. 
<s>  she's out, i'm gonna take her home. 
<rachel> oh, ok, thank you.  do you see what all the guys see in her? 
<monica> wouldn't kick her out of bed. no more vodka for me!   
<joey> hey rach, so can i sing happy birthday to you now? 
<rachel> yeah, sure! 
<joey> oh ...  happy birth ...  oh, see you later  
<monica> hey rach, somebody got you shoes! 
<rachel> oh, give me!  
<phoebe> be careful, be careful! these are my rat babies! 
<s> yeah. we have rat babies now. 
<rachel> ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party? 
<monica> so this is what a stroke feels like. 
<phoebe> i had to bring them! we killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. you know, they require constant care. you should know that, rachel, you're a mother. 
<rachel> are you comparing my daughter to a rat? 
<phoebe> no! seven rats! i think we should take them home, we need feed them. 
<rachel> whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats? 
<phoebe> well i'm sorry rachel, but i'm not like you, ok? not everyone can afford help.   
<ross> where the hell are joey and molly? i asked you to watch them. 
<chandler>  i'm sorry, i got a little occupied. 
<ross> we have to stop them before something happens! 
<chandler>  right behind you, big guy!  
< 
<joey> so you see, molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. it takes a lot of hard work. 
<s> so where did you study? 
<joey> oh, i didn't go to college. 
<s> no, where did you study acting? 
<joey> molly ... people don't study acting ...  
<ross> molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute? 
<s> sure, i'll go check on emma. 
<ross> thanx.  
<joey>  will the stable boy never get the princess?? 
<ross> what do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch? 
<joey> no ... the leather sticks to my ass. you know, this isn't fair. what makes you think that i'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? huh? can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that i actally like her, and might want something real?  look, the truth is, i haven't felt this way about anyone since rachel, ok? i didn't think i could ever love again.  
<joey> ok   
<s> hi, is molly here? 
<ross> yeah, come on in. molly? 
<s>  hey! guys, this is tabatha .  i'll see you tomorrow. 
<ross> ok ...  well, uh, joey, i guess we have no problem. 
<joey> it's like my favorite fairy tale come true!  the princess, the stable boy and the lesbian! 
< 
<phoebe> ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and i start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed. 
<s> hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve around their rats? 
<phoebe> well, you know what, they're our responsibility now. 
<s> ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. what happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them? 
<phoebe> mate? they're all brothers and sisters. 
<s> yeah - not such a problem with rats. no, they're more of a "love the one you're with" kind of animals. 
<phoebe> no.  wh - get off your sister! oh my god, what are we gonna do? we have 7 rats. so what if each of them has 7 rats? and then each of those have 7 rats? that's like ...  that's math i can't even do! what are we gonna do? 
<s> well, i know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives. 
<phoebe> yeah, ok. i guess you're right. allright, so we should just give them away. but to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. they're bob's favorites. 
<s> it's gonna be ok. 
<phoebe> you must think i'm crazy. 
<s> no, i think you're sweet. 
<phoebe> good. it's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. i guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when i gave birth to my brother's triplets and i had to give them up.  i haven't told you about that yet, have i? 
< 
<monica> hey! 
<rachel> hi. thanks for the party, honey. should i help you clean up? 
<monica> no way! you had your party, now i have mine! is everything alright? 
<rachel> yeah, i just get a little bummed when my birthday's over. 
<monica> well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. that jerk gavin from your office didn't show up . 
<rachel> mmm hmm. 
<s> yeah, hey.  
<monica> oh, we weren't talking about you. no, no way to recover. 
<rachel> no.  
<s> nice party. 
<rachel> well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at  ...?? god! oh, this party was lame ... 
<monica>  again, you're welcome. 
<s> look, i'll just give you this and go. 
<rachel> oh, you bought me a present! why? 
<s> well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. there are presents, and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person. ok, i ... got you the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier. 
<rachel> aww. well, ok, well that's very nice. and you wrote a card . "from gavin" 
<s> i really mean it. 
<rachel>  awww, awww, it's beautiful. 
<s> you don't mind?  well, what do you know, it fits! 
<rachel> see, gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. why did you give me such a hard time? 
<s> i'm not sure. 
<rachel> well monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me. 
<s> i do have feelings for you. 
<rachel> you do? 
<s> yes, i feel that you are a little annoying. 
<rachel> see? why, gavin, why? right when i'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ...  and you do that ...   ending credits 
<chandler>  first i was afraid, i was petrified  
<phoebe>  hey 
<chandler>  hi 
<phoebe> listen, i think i've left something here. 
<chandler> oh, well someone left this . this is yours? 
<phoebe>  no, but i like it. i think i left one of my rat babies. 
<chandler> oh, uh, well, i haven't seem it but if i do i'll let you know. 
<monica> ohmygod! rat baby! rat baby! rat baby!  
<phoebe>  ooh, maybe that's him! and sebastiano  
< 
<chandler> hey! 
<ross> yeah! yeah! ok! sure! look! can we...can we talk about what happened here last night? 
<chandler> sure! just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! do you believe that who ever did something over here last night did what they did or didn't do ...i mean come on!! 
<ross> ok you...you really don't know what i am talking about? 
<chandler> no! 
<ross> ok! last night after the party i saw rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony. 
<chandler> our balcony? seriously? that's so funny because i told monica we should put lights on our balcony. and she said "no, no. it's too cold, nobody will go out there." and i said "maybe if we put some light out there they will" 
<ross> right that's why i came over to talk about. hum...i saw rachel kissing some guy on your balcony, even though there were no lights ! 
<chandler> so are you gonna...talk to her? 
<ross> why...why should i? i mean if she wants to move on, that's fine! 
<chandler> you know when "that's fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits! 
<ross> no i'm serious. i mean she wants to date people? fine! i don't care but...at least she could have told me. you know i...i've been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys she barely knows, then so will i ! very funny! ross is gay! ah! ah! 
<chandler> no no no. good. so you're moving on? do you have any idea where you're moving? 
<ross> i don't know. i mean i have plenty of opportunity. just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me. and then the other day on the subway a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand. 
<chandler> dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life! 
<ross> well, and how about this? there is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental potluck dinner. 
<chandler> why did i get married?!  
< 
<joey> hey! let me ask you guys something. i have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks i should have my eyebrows waxed. is that weird for a guy? 
<phoebe> well it depends. 
<joey> on...? 
<phoebe> on how far along he's in the sex change process! 
<monica> no i totally disagree. no i think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. such you an actor. not that you need to, your eyebrows are... 
<joey> ok! stop it you guys! stop staring! you're freaking me out! 
<phoebe> your knuckles are kinda hairy too... 
<joey> oh man! i have to get those done too?! 
<phoebe> wow! talking about high maintenance 
<joey> hey hey! you dye your hair! 
<phoebe> i'm a woman! 
<joey> arghhh! double standards! 
<phoebe> oh before i forget, are you coming to mike's piano bar tonight? 
<monica> only if i don't have to get up and sing. 
<phoebe> but everybody sings. it's so much fun! last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out and everyone booed him off the stage. so funny. 
<monica> it's just, i'm not good at singing. 
<phoebe> oh! what's the matter? are you scared? you're afraid i'm a better singer? you're afraid i'm gonna beat you at singing? 
<monica> no no, it's not working on me. wow! i must be growing up! 
<phoebe> ok fine! please come and support mike. you don't have to sing. 
<monica> so i don't have to sing and i can just sit there and pass judgments on others? 
<phoebe> while drinking... 
<monica> i'm there! 
<rachel> hi guys! listen i really need your help. i think i did something really stupid. 
<phoebe> well yes rachel but you got something so beautiful out there 
<rachel> no not that. i kissed gavin last night. 
<phoebe> oh my god. 
<monica> you kissed him? 
<rachel> yeah. it was after the party, we were on the balcony and... 
<monica> wait wait wait. i was at home the whole time. how did i missed that? 
<phoebe> it was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper. 
<monica> oh yeah...so how did you end up kissing? 
<rachel> you know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf... 
<monica> i thought you hated him? 
<rachel> you know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf! 
<monica> so are you thinking of starting up something with this guy? 
<rachel> i don't know. it's so complicated. i work with this guy, you know, i have the baby, and i have ross, and i just...i don't know what to do and i have to be at the office and see gavin in ten minutes. 
<monica> sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to gavin, and you definitely should talk to ross 
<rachel> or...i could call in sick and not deal with it at all... 
<phoebe> wow! five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!! 
< 
<joey> hey. i'm here for my eyebrow appointment. 
<joey> chandler bing. will be right with you. 
<joey> ok thanks. . i touched the stuff 
<s> i'll take care of it 
<joey> thanks. do you get a lot of guys in here? 
<s> oh absolutely. 
<joey> oh good... 
<s> are you looking to meet somebody? 
<joey> all right let's just do this. 
<s> we'll get to the wax in a minute. first i want to tweeze some of the strays, ok? this may sting just a little bit... 
<joey> please i have an extremely high threshold...holly mother of god! my face! my face!! i'm all right! i'm all right! just a little bit of shock that's all but i'll be fine you can go again. i'm ok  dammit! woman!! how hoooow! 
< 
<chandler> hey it's the most eligible man in ny. how's the moving on going? 
<ross> not well. i went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants. 
<chandler> well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. you know i mean think about it. single white male, divorced three times, two illegitimate children. the personal ad writes itself.... 
<ross> that's funny...do you think you'll ever work again? 
<chandler> what are doing? you know i can only dish it out! 
<ross> i can't believe rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me 
<chandler> maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing 
<ross> no no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar. 
<chandler> did she go out with him? 
<ross> no. when he called, i...i threw the message away. 
<chandler> ah! the high road... 
<ross> you know what? enough! enough talking! i have to get moving! hey check out those two blondes over there! hey come with me! 
<chandler> are you trying to get everybody divorced? 
<ross> you don't have to do anything. it will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? you...you break the ice with some kind of jokes so that they know you're the funny one and i swoop in with some interesting conversation, so they'll see that i'm the brilliant, brooding, sexy one... 
<chandler> i thought i had to make the jokes! 
<ross> don't you have to be at work? 
<chandler> oh come on! hello! hi! my name is chandler, here's my friend ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. we only need six more people for a human pyramid...swoop!! swoop!! 
<ross> hum...so...hum...oh hey i noticed you were reading the paper...another would you rather drown or be burnt alive?" 
<chandler> we still got it! 
< 
<rachel> who is it? 
<s> gavin! i brought you some soup. 
<rachel> why? 
<s> i heard you were sick... 
<rachel> oh! right! yeah! hold on, i'll be just clean up in here a little bit! hello gavin 
<s> i missed you at work today. how are you feeling? 
<rachel> i a not gonna lie to you, i'm pretty sick 
<s> oh! good! because i was having a totally paranoid moment when i thought you called in sick to avoid me. 
<rachel> oh no no no 
<s> so i had fun last night 
<rachel> so did i 
<s> exactly how contagious is this thing you have? i mean is it a cold for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you? 
<rachel> it's just a cold 
<s> do you have fever? let me see. hum... 
<rachel> what? what's the matter? 
<s> what's ross doing to you on that picture? 
<rachel> oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. he thought it would be funny. 
<s> right. right. ross. so what's the deal with you guys? i don't want to get in the middle of anything 
<rachel> oh you're not. you're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about ross really, really.  oh! hide! that's ross! hide! hide! 
<s> yeah! but you said not to worry about... 
<rachel> i lied! and i'm not sick! just stay behind the curtain! 
<s> hi! 
<rachel> oh! molly! you're not ross. 
<s> no i'm here to take emma to your mother's, remember? 
<rachel> right, right, yes! 
<s> don't panic! 
<rachel> what? 
<s> there is a man behind your curtain. i have a mace in my purse. 
<rachel> no! that's ok! that's ok! that's ok! no no no no! this is my business associate gavin. he's just being silly. gavin come out from behind that curtain! 
<s> hi! gavin! please to meet you. it was my idea to stand there. 
<s> hello! i just go and get emma. 
<rachel> ok. 
<s> so hum...why did i have to hide? 
<rachel> i thought it was ross. 
<s> so what if it was? i thought there was nothing going on between you two... 
<rachel> there isn't. there is totally isn't. 
<s> you hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming out of a chute for the first time. i used to be a rodeo clown. 
<rachel> all right. look. gavin...i...i guess i felt guilty that you were here, which i shouldn't. you know ross and i are not in any relationship but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus there is just so much history...you know it's just...i don't know, i'm sorry, i'm just all over the place. 
<s> it's ok. i know it's probably not my place but can i give you a piece of advice? 
<rachel> yes 
<s> i think you should talk to ross about all this. 
<rachel> people keep saying that. oh i'm sorry gavin 
<s> don't be. it's just bad timing. 
<rachel> so seriously...rodeo clown? 
<s> one of the best, ma'am, one of the best... 
< 
<phoebe> "no time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!" thank you!  
<s> oh she's my girlfriend. that's not just how we do it here. i got to get a break and when we come back we've got kenneth singing "i touch myself"...i'm not here to judge! 
<phoebe> hi hi...oh you have got to sing. 
<monica> no i told you i can't. 
<phoebe> but you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice. 
<monica> what have you heard me sing? 
<phoebe> all the time when you're cooking. 
<monica> what? 
<phoebe> yeah you're always singing "yummy yummy yummy, i've got love in my tummy" 
<monica> yeah i do rock that one. 
<phoebe> ok so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there? 
<monica> just a little but...it's just so scary! i don't even know what i would sing... 
<s> well i've got a book around... 
<monica> "delta dawn" 
< 
<ross> hi! i could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace 
<s> you already hit on me an hour ago 
<ross> right, so that's a firm "no". i cannot believe this, i just keep striking out. 
<chandler> i don't get it neither, i mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed 
<ross> this is great. rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and i'm gonna die alone. 
<chandler> by drowning or...?! 
<s> why would he break up with me? 
<s> all i ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back. i mean, am i so unlovable? 
<chandler> well... 
<ross> i know!  
< 
<s> all right, that was kenneth with his much too literal rendition of "i touch myself". coming up next we've got monica singing "delta dawn". 
<monica> wait wait! i can't sing in front of all these people. 
<phoebe> just pretend they're not even here! it's ok monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone anyway. 
<monica> hi! i'm monica and i'm gonna be singing "delta dawn" "delta dawn, what's that flower you have on? could it be a faded rose from days gone by? ..." 
<phoebe> can you totally see through her shirt ? 
<s> like an x-ray. bad day not to wear a bra. 
<monica> "to take you to his mansion in the sky-y?" 
< 
<joey> hey, i need your help. 
<chandler> wow, it seems serious. what seems to be the problem, ashley judd? 
<joey> look, i'll get new headshot taken, all right, so i want to get my eyebrows shaped 
<chandler> i am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please! 
<joey> you may be a sissy but i'll still . all right, it hurts so bad, i could only let her do one eyebrow and now... they dont match! 
<chandler> its like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama! 
<joey> all right, look, you got to help me out, ok? look, i have the magic marker, i want you to fill in the skinny one so i dont look stupid for my pictures. 
<chandler> ok. first of all, this is green! 
<joey> what the hell am i supposed to do! 
<chandler> all right, i will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what i am about to tell you. 
<joey> what, what. 
<chandler> ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well i earned mine by plucking the eyebrows of my father and his business partners. 
<joey> oh my god! 
<chandler> yeah, well, i guess you dont need my help victor victoria! 
<joey> ok all right, no, no, no, no, i do, i do, i do, i need your help, but chandler i dont know if i can take anymore plucking. it hurts so bad! 
<chandler> oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe vera and my gentle self-loathing touch. 
< 
<monica> "take me to the mansion in the sky-y". i am sorry, the song is over. did you see me out there? 
<phoebe> every little bit of you! 
<monica> i cant believe i did this. i cant believe i'm singing for the people, and they liked me! hey, did you hear that one shouting look at those tips! i mean, did i really help you get a lot of tips? 
<s> sure. 
<phoebe> mon', not that you didnt sound good, but... 
<monica> good? didnt you hear them...i was great! thank you so much for making me do this. thats is the best gift ever. 
<s> also a good gift? underwear. 
< 
<s> thank you so much for letting me do this. public bathrooms freak me out, i can't even pee, let alone do anything else. 
<ross> but, whats great is that you dont mind talking about it. 
<s> its so amazing i met you the same day that eric broke up with me, because its like you lose a boyfriend, you get a boyfriend. 
<ross> uh-ah! 
<s> no dont worry, this is not some rebound thing. i am totally over eric. 
<ross> . good choice ross. 
<rachel> oh, hey! hi, there you are, ive been looking for you everywhere! 
<ross> oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here i am. 
<rachel> listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o clock. so i was hoping you and i could have a chance to kind of talk somebody here? 
<ross> oh, yeah, yeah thats michelle. 
<rachel> who? 
<ross> oh, just this woman ive been seeing. 
<rachel> youve being seeing someone? 
<ross> yeah, didnt i mention that? yeah, i mean, we havent being going out for too long, but rather there is this amazing connection between us. i-i mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend. i thought it was a little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kinda nice. 
<s> what are you taking amoxicillin for? 
<ross> how great is this? you are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. oh, i am sorry michelle, thats my roommate, rachel. 
<rachel> hi, and i am also emmas mother. 
<s> ah, who is emma? 
<ross> i told you about my daughter. 
<s> this is your daughter? i can be your new mummy! 
< 
<chandler> and done! 
<joey> oh my god! i didnt feel a thing ! hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around that sadistic bitch at the saloon 
<chandler> thanks. you wanna see what it looks like? 
<joey> yeah, yeah. hey, they totally match! they look great! they look great! how you doing! 
<chandler> yeah, yeah, i think it looks pretty good. i was a little worried i was uncovering a birthmark right about there, but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate. 
<joey> thank you so much. 
<chandler> no problem. 
<joey> listen thats a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it. 
<chandler> yeah. 
<joey> comb my eyelashes. 
< 
<monica> ok, for my next song i think ill sing something a little more upbeat. all right? oh, how about the pointer sisters i am so excited. and make it bouncy! 
<phoebe> oh youll probably take care of that on your hands. 
<chandler> i am sorry i am late. youll understand when youll see joey. 
<monica> honey, youre just in time, im about to sing another song! 
<chandler> really? in front of all this people? 
<monica> and they love me! 
<chandler> oh my god! 
<phoebe> yes, she gives the people what they want. 
<monica> all right, watch! 
<monica> "tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. give in this time and show me some affection..." 
<chandler> are those my wifes nipples? 
<phoebe> oh? isnt that funny? i didn't see that before, i wouldn't have let her go up again. 
<chandler> i gotta stop this. 
<monica> oh, who cares, they still love me! "i am so excited..." 
<chandler> you, touching yourself, out! 
< 
<rachel> wow. she does that a lot! 
<s> ross, you didnt tell me you were a doctor! 
<rachel> what, what, wait a minute! you havent even told her you were a doctor, yet? how long have you known her, like an hour? 
<s> actually about an hour and a half. 
<ross> i told you it wasnt long, but there is an amazing connection between us. 
<s> you feel that too? oh, i thought that was just me! 
<ross> are you kidding? 
<s> hey, do you want to go away this weekend? 
<ross> well see. 
<rachel> ok, ross, whats going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now? 
<ross> i dont know, are we just kissing guys on balconies? 
<rachel> how do you know about that? 
<ross> through the magic of sight! i was here, putting our child to sleep... 
<s> emma. 
<ross> when i happened to look through the window and i see you kissing a guy you know, for what? a week? 
<rachel> oh, thats what this is all about? did you bring her up here to get back at me? 
<s> no, actually, see i had to pee, cause i cant use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites. 
<ross> ok, michelle, its time to go. 
<s> well, call me! 
<ross> ok. 
<s> no, wait, you dont have my phone number! 
<ross> you know, if its meant to be, ill guess it. bye, bye. 
<rachel> score. 
<ross> oh, i am sorry, did you not like her, because i was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on the balcony. 
<rachel> oh god, i cant believe youre making such a big deal about this. it was one kiss, one guy, one time! 
<ross> oh, really! 
<rachel> yeah. 
<ross> oh, really! 
<rachel> oh yeah. 
<ross> what about the guy from the bar? 
<rachel> what? who? 
<ross> the guy you gave your number to. 
<rachel> whoa, how do you know about that? 
<ross> because he called here looking for you. so dont tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing, ok? youve been out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. and you didnt even have the courtesy to tell me. 
<rachel> why didnt i get that message? 
<ross> what? 
<rachel> from the guy in the bar, why didnt i get that message? 
<ross> because i folded it up and put in my pants pocket. do you...do you not look there? 
<rachel> ross? 
<ross> i never gave it to you. 
<rachel> why? 
<ross> i dont know. 
<rachel> oh god. you know what? who you think you are? who are you to decide what messages i should or should not get? 
<ross> who am i? 
<rachel> yes. 
<ross> i am the guy whos taking care of our baby while youre out at bars meeting guys! 
<rachel> oh my god, i cannot believe this. you know i actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you about us! but i cant do that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my apartment! 
<ross> none of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! thats not the point. ok? the point is you...you are the one who moved on and didnt tell anyone! 
<rachel> oh, ross, this is just so messed up! whats wrong with us? you know when people hear about our situation they always ask, what, you live together but youre not a couple? and you have a baby, isnt that weird?» and i say no. you know what, its not, because it works for us!» but you know this doesnt work. in fact this is the opposite of working! 
<ross> uh, clearly. 
<rachel> and you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. an maybe this, you know, just doesnt make sense anymore. 
<ross> yeah, maybe not. so what you wanna do? 
< 
<joey> hey! 
<rachel> hi. can emma and i live here for a while? 
<joey> ha, oh, of course. 
<rachel> thank you. 
<joey> your eyebrows look weird.  
<chandler> jeremiah was a bullfrog. was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but i helped him drink his wine. so you just touch yourself for anything? untitled document written by sherry bilsing-graham & ellen plummer transcribed by marita bakken 
< 
<joey> morning, roomie! 
<rachel> hey! you remembered to put clothes on this morning. 
<joey> fifth day's a charm. 
<rachel> oh, joey, it's so great to be back here. i gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and emma. 
<joey> hey, it's great having you back. you know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?  
<ross> hey, you're not naked! so hey, rach, when will we expect to see you tonight? 
<rachel> well, i'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. but she did actually fall back to sleep, so... 
<joey> she's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night. 
<rachel> bye!  
<ross> bye! hey, i hope emma isn't making it too hard on you. 
<joey> no, hey, it's been great. 
<ross> yeah? 
<joey> yeah. and look, i just want you to know that with rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? and even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump... 
<ross> yeah, that'll do it. 
<joey> wow! so, how are you? 
<ross> i'm, i'm okay. 
<joey> really? 
<ross> sure, i mean, do i wish me and rachel living together would have worked out? of course. you know, i'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce. 
<joey> well, actually it... 
<ross> no, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! anyway, i think rachel and i need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people. 
<joey> wow, really? 
<ross> yeah, sure, why not? in fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me... 
<joey> sure, i know lots of girls. 
<ross> yeah? any names come to mind? 
<joey> ooh, names? opening credits. 
< 
<phoebe> hey. 
<joey> hey. i was just gonna get something to eat. you want something? 
<phoebe> what you got? joey see, we got strained peas, strained carrots... ooh! strained plums. we haven't tried that yet. 
<phoebe> goodie! thanks. so, how is it living with rachel again? i mean, apart from the great food. 
<joey> i'm fine, i'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and ross. you know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody. 
<phoebe> oh my god, rachel asked me if i knew anyone for her too. 
<joey> why are they doing this? 
<phoebe> i don't know. they're so perfect for each other; it's crazy. 
<joey> you know what's crazy? these jars. what is it, like two bites in here? 
<phoebe> i just wish they'd realise they should be together. 
<joey> i know, i know. and when they moved back in together, i figured y'know, that's where things were headed. 
<phoebe> i know. they should be a family. they should get married and have more children. 
<joey> yes, and they should name one of their kids joey. i may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name. 
<phoebe> you know what? maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other. 
<joey> yeah, because it is slim pickings. still in the bedroom. 
<phoebe> so, what are we gonna do? are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people? 
<joey> i know; that just pushes them further and further apart. 
<phoebe> yeah.  oh, i know what we can do. we could set ross and rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together. 
<joey> ooh, that's a great plan! 
<phoebe> yeah, you know what the best part of it is? i get to do my "plan-laugh."   
<joey> shhh! not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...  
< 
<rachel> hey! 
<monica> hey! 
<rachel> you guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you? 
<chandler> see, now, why would you assume that? just because we're married? i will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. now, if you'll excuse me, i have to get back to reading the obituaries. 
<rachel> i was just asking 'cause i need someone to watch emma tonight. 
<monica> sure, we'll do that. what are you up to? 
<rachel> well, phoebe set me up on a date. 
<monica> oh my god. 
<chandler> wow. 
<rachel> why? what's the big deal? 
<monica> just figured, 'cause you and ross are... 
<rachel> what, slept together a year and a half ago? yeah, i'm all set. 
<chandler> well, i think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? i mean, it sounds healthy. i mean, you have needs. embrace your womanhood! 
<monica> you want a job? turn off "oprah," and send out a resume! 
<rachel> so i'll bring her by around seven? is that okay? 
<monica> oh, it's perfect. 
<rachel> oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! she's at such a cute age. oh, a couple things. now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. and watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. and oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... thanks, you guys. have fun! i wish i was reading my own name. 
< 
<phoebe> ooh, joey. 
<joey> hey. 
<phoebe> hey. i'm so excited; i just set up rachel with the worst guy tonight. 
<joey> all right! who is he? 
<phoebe> well, it's this guy i used to massage. and by massage, i mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me. wait till you hear who i got for ross. 
<phoebe> oh, yeah.  
<joey> she's this really boring woman. she's a teacher! 
<phoebe> a teacher? 
<joey> yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... and oh, oh, she loves puzzles. huh? come on, who loves puzzles? 
<phoebe> well, ross does. what... you're - you're ruining the plan! joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman! 
<joey> oh my god, you're right! 
<phoebe> yeah. 
<joey> she even reads for pleasure! 
<phoebe> how do you even know a woman like that? 
<joey> what? i'm not allowed to know smart women? 
<phoebe> joey. 
<joey> i met her at the library. i went in to pee. 
<phoebe> so now what do we do? 
<joey> well, okay, i'll - i'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else. 
<phoebe> what if we don't find him somebody else? we'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up! 
<joey> ooh...i hear that's bad. 
<phoebe> ooh, so this is great! rachel's gonna have a terrible date, ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together. 
<joey> ah, yes, the plan!  
<phoebe> it's not santa's plan. no, it's...   
<joey> yeah, you know, it's not that fun. 
<phoebe> no, i think we killed it. 
< 
<chandler> emma? emma? look at me! well, i think i'll go downstairs for a while.  
<chandler> no, no, no, no! no, no, no, no! it's okay, it's okay. i didn't go. don't cry, it's just a bit! i'm your uncle chandler; funny is all i have!  
<monica> okay, just so you know, i'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours. 
<chandler> i don't do that.  
<chandler> i'll try to stop. wait, did you say until the sixth? 
<monica> yeah. 
<chandler> today is the sixth. 
<monica> no, it's not.  
<chandler> yes, it's also 2003. 
<monica> oh my god. today's the sixth?! i may be done ovulating! i may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant. 
<chandler> it's okay. go take the test and see if we're okay. 
<monica> okay.  
<chandler> tough crib. 
<monica> hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? there's only one here. 
<chandler> i might have checked to see if i was ovulating a couple times. 
<monica> chandler! 
<chandler> i am not working. there's not much to do around here! 
< 
<ross> excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle? 
<s> uh, there's a drunk chinese guy. 
<ross> well, if i'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me. 
<s> can i get you another glass of wine? 
<ross> nah, i don't know if i should. i don't wanna be drunk when i go home alone. 
<s> got stood up, huh? 
<ross> yeah, it's no big deal. it's just a blind date. 
<s> are you worried your date came, saw you, and left? 
<ross> no!  
< 
<monica> we're okay. i'm still ovulating. 
<chandler> oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, i am not. 
<monica> so, let's do this. 
<chandler> i - i don't think i can. 
<monica> come on. i know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute. 
<chandler> because of emma. 
<monica> oh my god, emma. oh, sweetie, i forgot you were here. oh, you're right, we can't do this. we can't leave her alone. 
<chandler> sorry. 
<monica> unless... maybe we do it here. i mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age? 
<chandler> well, she's aware when we leave the room. she may notice if we start... canoodling in it. 
<monica> canoodling? 
<chandler> well, i can't say "hump" or "screw" in front of the b-a-b-y. 
<monica> i don't know. i mean, i guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so... 
<chandler> horrifying? scarring? something people go to jail for? 
<monica> i guess you're right. 
<chandler> you guess i'm right? when we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window. 
<monica> but what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer? 
< 
<rachel> wow, everything looks so good! i think i'm gonna have the chicken. to say this; you're really beautiful. 
<rachel> oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. thank you. 
<s> i'm kind of funny looking. 
<rachel> what? 
<s> oh, come on, you're way out of my league. everybody in here knows it. bet that guy over there's probably saying, "ooh, why she out with him? he must be rich!" well, i'm not! you wanna order? i'm really excited about that chicken. 
<s> i'm not funny either. so, if you were thinking, "well, he's not that good-looking, but maybe we'll have some laughs"... that ain't gonna happen. 
<rachel> well, come on, steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. hey, now wait a minute. phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. that's impressive. 
<s> i lost it. to drugs.  
<s> i silk-screen t-shirts now. 
<rachel> really? what's that like? 
<s> it's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money. that's right. i have no money, i'm not funny, i live in a studio apartment with two other guys, and i'm pretty sure i'm infertile. rachel on, steve. there must be something that you like about yourself. 
<s> i do like my hair. 
<rachel> really? 
< 
<phoebe> hello?  
<rachel> phoebe, it's me. i'm going to hunt you down and kill you! 
<phoebe> hey, rach! 
<rachel> this is the worst date ever. how could you set me up with this creep? 
<phoebe> you know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends. 
<rachel> i don't care! this guy is a nightmare! 
<phoebe> oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned. 
<rachel> he's not stoned. 
<phoebe> did he go out for a cigarette? 
<rachel> yeah, four times. 
<phoebe> my dear, sweet rach.  rachel is having a miserable time, and ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone. 
<joey> oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together. 
<phoebe> by the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny mexico.  oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan. 
< 
<monica> she's asleep. chandler?  
<monica> what are you doing? 
<chandler> emma was doing it! 
<monica> she's asleep. 
<chandler> ooh, she's asleep, that means we can... 
<monica> yes, but we have to be fast. can't make any noise.  
<joey> hello?  
<joey> emma? hey! hi!  
<joey> how are ya? how are ya? where are your babysitters, huh? why's the bedroom door closed?  
<joey> you can't have s-e-x, when you're taking care of the b-a-b-i-e!  
< 
<s> i've got bad news. the chinese guy left. 
<ross> eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be. 
<s> look; you got stood up, who cares? we're gonna show you a good time. just sit and relax. in fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on the house. 
<ross> wow, free crab cakes. well, that's nice. although i was hoping to have sex tonight. 
<s> ooh...  
<ross> just the crab cakes.  waiter 
<s> what are you doing? are you trying to get him to stay? because you can't do that. 
<s> just get out of here, okay? 
<ross> what's - what's going on? 
<s> eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. we have a bet on how long it'll take before you give up and go home. 
<ross> what? you - you're making money off my misery? 
<s> well, if you stay till, i am. 
<ross> this is unbelievable. i - i have never been so insulted in my life. now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, i'll be on my way. 
< 
<monica> well, that was weird. you were loud, and i was fast. 
<chandler> i think we may have really done it this time. 
<monica> oh, i wish i didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test. 
<chandler> you may wanna get some more of those too.  
<chandler> where's emma? 
<monica> oh my god, where's emma? where's emma? 
<chandler> don't ask me, i was in there canoodling you! 
<monica> okay, okay, i'm sure that rachel came home early and picked up emma. you go look across the hall, and i'll call her cell. 
<chandler> okay.  
<monica> hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to rachel. 
< crying in front of you. you must think i'm so pathetic. 
<rachel> no, no, no, i admire a man who can cry. 
<s> really?  
<rachel> don't touch my coat!  
<rachel> oh, sorry, it's my phone. hello? 
<rachel> oh my god, this is the worst date ever!  rachel sorry, but did you really think that this was going well?  what's up? 
<monica> hey, did you stop by here? 
<rachel> no. 
<monica> oh my god, then...  
<monica> oh, thank god! emma, there you are! 
<rachel> what? what do you mean, "there you are"? where was she? 
<monica> oh, we were playing "peek-a-boo." she just  she loves it when i'm dramatic.  monica her? 
<joey> because you two were having sex! 
<monica> no, we weren't! 
<joey> don't you lie to me! i could tell by chandler's hair.  you are so lazy. can't you get on top for once? 
<chandler> all right, all right, we were. we were trying to make a baby. monica's ovulating. 
<joey> hey! it is unacceptable that you two would have sex with emma in the next room. i'm gonna have to tell rachel about this.  
<chandler> no, no, no. 
<monica> no, please don't. please, joey. she will kill us! 
<joey> hey, i gotta! unless... 
<monica> unless what? 
<joey> unless you name your firstborn child joey. 
<chandler> what? why? 
<joey> hey, i may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name. 
<chandler> your family name is tribbiani. 
<joey>  you almost had me.  
< 
<rachel> well, uh... 
<s> look, i think i know the answer to this question, but... would you like to make love to me? 
<rachel> really, really not. 
<s> eh, it's just as well. doesn't work anyway. 
<rachel> all right, well that's good to know. good night, steve.  
<ross> hey, what's wrong? 
<rachel> i just had a rough night. 
<ross> oh. crab cake? 
<rachel> eww! 
<ross> well, what happened? 
<rachel> oh, well, i...it's kind of weird talking to you about this, but... 
<ross> monica told me you had a blind date. 
<rachel> yeah. 
<ross> i did, too. 
<rachel> oh. 
<ross> but is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up? 
<rachel> oh, oh no. do you think she walked in, saw you and left? 
<ross> why does everyone keep saying that? 
<rachel> well, if it makes you feel any better, i wish my date hadn't shown up. 
<ross> that bad? 
<rachel> well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.  
<ross> female body inspector? what size is that?  
<phoebe> now, wait a minute. so, they're gonna name their first child joey? 
<joey> uh-huh. 
<phoebe> how - how do i get them to name the next one after me? 
<joey> it's easy, you just walk in on them having sex. 
<phoebe> oh, so they owe me like, three phoebes.  
<phoebe> oh my god! look, it's ross and rachel. oh, the plan is working.  
<phoebe> don't, don't do the plan-laugh.  
<ross> the first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters. 
<rachel> oh. huh. you know, it is weird that phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that joey set you up on a date that didn't even show. 
<ross> wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? i mean, that's just stupid.  
<joey> we're geniuses! yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding. 
<phoebe> oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.  
<phoebe> oh, they see us! oh, they, they look mad. oh, they figured it out. they're coming this way. run! 
<joey> where? 
<phoebe> mexico!  end credits. 
< 
<joey> can you believe they're still not here? 
<ross> i know. a double blind date, and we both get stood up. what are the chances? 
<joey> i know, i'm so bummed. can we have our free crab cakes now? 
<s> what? 
<joey> we've been stood up.  and we want our free crab cakes. 
<s> guys, give it a rest. nobody's betting on you tonight. although we do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry.  
<s> i have such fat hands! pohl

<chandler> thank you. i got a job in advertising.  
<monica>  oh, honey, that's incredible! 
<phoebe>  gosh, what's the pay like?  oh, come on people  come on, now, if i don't know who makes the most, how do i know who i like the most!  hey joey!  
<chandler> actually, it pays nothing. it's an internship. 
<joey> oh, that's cool. we have interns at 'days of our lives'. 
<chandler> right. so, it'll be the same except less sex with you.  
<ross> so, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there? 
<chandler> well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like. 
<phoebe>  that's great. 
<chandler> yeah, i mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating  
<chandler>  humiliating and noble!  
<ross> you know, if i didn't already have a job, i think, i would have been really good in advertising. 
<monica> ross, you did not come up with "got milk?"

<monica> hey, how did the audition go? 
<joey> well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, lennart haze did not like me.  
<monica> what happened? 
<joey> well, he said i wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything i did was horizontal and i should be more vertical. oh, and he said that i should think less. 
<monica> so far so good!  
<chandler>  honey, i'm old! 
<monica>  what's wrong? 
<chandler> i am so much older than these other interns. i can't compete with them. 
<monica> so you're a little older. try to look at the positive all this life experience. 
<chandler> yes, but i don't think life experience with these.  
<joey> wooooooooow  it's like they're on fire! 
<monica> what are they?  
<chandler> they're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which i can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these. 
<joey>  i give you $ 500 for them! 
<chandler> what am i supposed to do with these? 
<monica> ah, come on, sneakers are easy. you wear sneakers all the time. 
<chandler> well, first of all, they're not called "sneakers" anymore. apparently, they're called "kicks" or "skids" and i think i heard somebody say "slorps".  roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity!  would you help me try to sell these? 
<monica> okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers? 
<chandler> no, i don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for. 
<joey> hey, that'd work on me! why did i get to buy mrs. butterwords? 
< 
<s> hey, hey! 
<ross> hey, you'll never guess what just happened phoebe and i got mugged! 
<monica> you okay?!

<phoebe> i'm sorry i have friends outside the six of us. 
<ross> you wanna know how she knew him?  because phoebe used to mug people. 
<monica>  seriously? 
<phoebe> well, i'm not proud of it, but, you know sometimes when i was living on the street and i needed money for food and stuff i 
<monica>  phoebe, that is awful! 
<phoebe> well, ok, i wasn't rich like you guys, ok, i didn't eat gold and have a flying pony i had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer 
<monica> you're mother killed herself! 
<phoebe> she was a drug dealer! 
<ross> well, anyway, it was a good thing phoebe knew the knew him, because  i was about to do some serious damage! 
<phoebe>  okay 
<monica> well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, ross. 
<phoebe> why? 
<monica> well, ross was mugged as a kid. 
<phoebe>  you were?

<ross> anyway, i was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen linzer torts for someone  your money, punk!" 
<phoebe>  oh my god

<ross> a superhuman thirst for knowledge. 
<monica> that's it. 
<ross> well, i-i better get to class  are there any more of your friends i should look out for on my way, phoebe? 
<phoebe> no actually, you might wanna stay away from jane street that's where stabby joe works.  
<phoebe> okay, i think we have a problem here. 
<monica> what? 
<phoebe> well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, i, uhm, i worked st. marc's comics. 
<monica> yeah? 
<phoebe> well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat. 
<monica> so? 
<phoebe> well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said- 
<monica> oh my god! 
<phoebe> i know i mugged ross!

<s> cut! that was good.  that was very good. you did everything i asked for. 
<joey>  i did? 
<s> yes. plus what you've got that i don't know what you've got going this squirmy quality that you bring into the character tomorrow for the final callbacks with the ***, do all of this what you've got going now, but  you know what?  more, more. can you do that? 
<joey> sure, yeah. i don't have time to say thank you because i really gotta go.  
<s>  look at that i like it i plant seeds i can't explain. 
< 
<monica> hey! 
<chandler> hey! 
<monica> what are you doing? 
<chandler> putting on the sneakers thought i'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything 
<rachel> oh, anything yet? 
<chandler> yes, how's this kicked in the nuts for your feet!  
<joey>  hey! 
<s> hey!  
<joey> probably wanna know what i'm doing ? 
<monica> no, that seems about right. 
<joey> yesterday at my audition, i really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. i got a call-back, so i'm drinking everything. oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great! 
<rachel> joey, that was formula. 
<joey> we gotta get more of that.  
<chandler>  you know what these aren't half-bad!  you should suggest something like these to ralph lauren. 
<rachel> okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, i'm not allowed to talk to ralph. 
<chandler> alright  i feel youger already!  
<chandler>  yah, i think i broke my hip. 
< 
<phoebe>  hey, you! 
<ross> hey! 
<phoebe> hey, how was class? 
<ross> no one ever asked me that, what's wrong? 
<phoebe> nothing, i really wanna know. 
<ross> oh  well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the pleistocene 
<phoebe>  alright, nothing is worth this. uhm, i have a confession to make uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid 
<ross>  wh-what are you talking about? it wasn't a girl. it was this huge dude. 
<phoebe> you don't have to lie anymore, ross, i know that it was a fourteen year-old girl. 
<ross> no, it wasn't. 
<phoebe> yes, it was. 
<ross> no, it wasn't. you don't think i would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old 
<phoebe>  "gimme your money, punk!" 
<ross>  oh my god, it was you! i can't believe it, you you mugged me? 
<phoebe>  yeah, and i'm so, so sorry, ross, i'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat.  i mean, well, it's just that i i've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and i have have a great one! 
<ross> it's not the best! 
<phoebe> i know, i'm sorry, please forgive me. i don't know what to say 
<ross>  there's nothing you can say. that was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me. 
<phoebe> really? even more humiliating than 
<ross>  hey, let's not do this!  
< 
<s> and then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hut tub and start making out with each other! 
<s>  that's interesting! just one thought mention the shoes. who's next?  chander 
<chandler> okay  you start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. he's about my age 
<s>  your age? 
<chandler> a-huh. so he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know maybe he falls maybe hurts himself. just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. he jumps over the old guy and laughs, 
<s> chandler, that's great! 
<chandler> oh, thank you, sir or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me  
<s> you see? that has a clear selling point. it appeals to our key demographic, it's .  you did you come up with that? 
<chandler>  i don't know, i don' i don' know! i was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow. 
<s> that is great. good work! chandler. thank you. 
<s> see all of you tomorrow.   
<chandler> the cold weather hurts my hip! 
< 
<phoebe> hey, ross!  i know you're still mad at me, but can i just talk to you for a second? 
<ross> sure, go ahead. whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead.  
<phoebe> i just really wanted to apologize again and and also show you something i think you'll find very exciting.  
<ross>  oh my god, crap from the street?  
<phoebe> look, ross, in this box are all the things i got from mugging that i thought were too special to sell or smoke.  anyway, i was looking through it and i found "science boy"  
<ross> oh my god.  i never thought i'd see this again.  it's all here. what made you save it all these years? 
<phoebe> i can't say, i just thought it was really good and maybe would be worth something some day. 
<ross> you really thought "science boy" was worth saving! 
<phoebe> yeah but you should know, i also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here. 
<ross> still this is amazing oh my god, thank you, phoebe. 
<phoebe> you're welcome. and thank you for "science boy". i learned a lot from him 
<ross> you're welcome.

< 
<monica> wow, that's a big cable bill! huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn on a saturday afternoon?!  i was in the house! 
<ross>  hey, uhm, phoebe didn't by any chance mention that 
<monica> that she was the huge guy that mugged you? yah. 
<ross> i see. you didn't happen to tell 
<monica> owen 
< 
<chandler> did you see our bank statement? can this be right? 
<monica> i know...god. i haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since i was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed oreos. what happened to all our money? 
<chandler> i'm not sure what they did, but i'm inclined to blame enron. 
<monica> i guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in. 
<chandler> maybe i should quit and get a job that pays. 
<monica> oh, but you're finally doing something that you love! i can't ask you to give that up. though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold. 
<chandler> you know what? you know what? i think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? so we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. and maybe we start eating out of joey's refrigerator for a change. you're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer? 
<monica> ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents. 
<chandler> no! we're not borrowing money. 
<monica> why not? 
<chandler> because we don't do that. we are bings! and if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money. 
<monica> wow! i had no idea you had this much pride. 
<chandler> that's right! i do! and i'm your man. and i'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard. opening credits 
< 
<s> i'm gonna go.  
<phoebe> why?? 
<s> i haven't been home in a couple of days and i need to get some more clothes. 
<phoebe> oh...you don't have to go, i have something that will fit you. 
<s> i put that tube top on as a joke. 
<phoebe> i want you to stay. 
<s> i want to stay too but i've gone as bad as much use out of these boxers as i can.. 
<phoebe> why don't you turn them inside ou... 
<s> done it.  i'll be back in a couple of hours. 
<phoebe> i'll miss you. 
<s> me too.  you know what? i just realised something. i don't wanna go home. 
<phoebe> great! ok...i'll go get the tube top. 
<s> no, no! what i mean is,  i hate going back to my apartment now... and partly because i live above a known crack den but... mostly because when i'm there, it's just, i really miss you. so.. do you want to move in together? 
<phoebe> wow, mike hannigan...you sure know how to make a girl say "hell yeah!" 
<s> so we're doing it? 
<phoebe> yeah! let's do it! let's live together!  oh god, we're really going to move in together! 
<s> yeah! 
<phoebe> i've always wanted to live with a guy. "pick up your socks!" "put down the toilet seat!" "no! we're not having sex anymore!" it's gonna be fun! 
< 
<monica> hey joey! 
<joey> hey! 
<monica> listen...i need to know that what i'm about to ask you, will never get back to chandler.  
<joey> i'd be lying if i said i haven't thought about it myself. chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. good......but wrong. 
<monica>  ok first of all...it would be great. but that's not what i'm here to talk to you about. i need to borrow some money. 
<joey> aww, i don't know monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake. 
<monica> but chandler lent you money! 
<joey> and i think he would tell you it was a mistake. 
<monica> come on...i just need it for some rent and..and some other bills. 
<joey> oh...how much? 
<monica> two thousand dollars? 
<joey> two thousand dollars!? what do you think i am? i soap opera star!? 
<monica> yeah... 
<joey> that's right i am!  
<rachel> hi you guys! 
<joey> oo...what's in the bag? 
<rachel> oh er... well you know emma started crawling? i realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. so i went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment. 
<joey> oh...baby-proofing... why is this such a big deal now? y'know, when i was a kid it was like.. "whoops! joey fell down the stairs!" or er.. "whoops! joey electrocuted himself again!" huh! 
<monica> anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff? 
<rachel> no. i was just going to do this myself.  
<joey> you're gonna do it? 
<rachel> yeah, why? you don't think a woman can do this? 
<joey> oh, women can. you can't. 
<rachel> monica...would you please tell joey that he is a pig? 
<monica> you're a pig. and you can't do this. 
<rachel> wha!? what!? come on! i found the hardware store all by myself! 
<joey> the hardware store is right down the street. 
<rachel> there is a hardware store right down the street? 
< 
<phoebe> hey you guys! ok, we've got great news. 
<s> phoebe and i are moving in together. 
<phoebe> i know it's so exciting! you know i've never lived with a guy before. 
<monica> well you know it's just like living with a girl. only they don't steal your makeup. unless they're playing "this is what my sister would look like"  
<chandler> yeah.... she's not so cute. 
<s> i'm gonna go to the bathroom. 
<phoebe> okay, well you put down the toilet seat. 
<s> yes dear. 
<monica> is that a bit you guys do? 
<phoebe> uh huh...we're playing you two. 
<monica> we don't do that! tell her we don't do that! 
<chandler> yes dear. 
<ross> i can't believe you guys are moving in together. that's, that's great! i mean...i'm happy for you guys.. 
<monica> i hear wedding bells. 
<phoebe> monica slow down! ok? i'm just excited to be living with him. you know i mean, i don't know, can i see someday being married to mike? sure! yeah. y'know..i can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. but do i want that house in connecticut...you know..near the good schools where mike and i can send sophie and mike junior.. oh my god i do. 
<ross> phoebe, i had no idea you were so conventional. 
<phoebe> i know! i guess i am! oh my god! load up the volvo i want to be a soccer mom! 
<s> you ready to go? 
<phoebe> yeah! you bet roomy! 
<monica> don't you mean..groomy? 
<s> what are you talking about? 
<phoebe> oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns.  
<phoebe> china patterns!!!!! 
< 
<rachel> this is easy...can't do this!  oh! wow! seriously i can't do this.  
< 
<chandler> hey joe! 
<joey> hey! 
<chandler> listen er..i need to ask you a favor but you can't tell monica anything about it. 
<joey> i thought you didn't have secrets from monica. 
<chandler> and that would have made the official party line.  monica and i are having a little financial trouble. 
<joey> yeah, i know. 
<chandler> what? what do you mean you know? 
<joey> err... i just figured it out! you know, i mean you're not working and the economy is bad. 
<chandler> oh! right. 
<joey>  that's the fastest i have ever thought! 
<chandler> anyway, err... i need to borrow some money. 
<joey> oh! sure! how much? two thousand dollars? 
<chandler> yes! two thousand dollars exactly! how do you know that!  
<joey> err...well i...know how much you used to make and i know how much your rent is.  
<chandler> oh ok. 
<joey>  i am on fire! do you...  did you write a cheque to monica for two thousand dollars? did monica borrow money from you? 
<joey> err... kind of. 
<chandler> i can't believe her! did she tell you we were having money problems? 
<joey> oh no no no no no... it wasn't... it wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her. 
<chandler> what? 
<joey> something personal. 
<chandler> what would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?  
<s> excuse me. 
<joey> boob job. 
<monica> i don't want her to get a boob job! that's crazy! 
<joey> well it's...it's not that crazy okay? making them smaller, that would be crazy. 
< 
<s> well hey, i wanna ask you about monica's little "groomy" joke. 
<phoebe> oh! alright. well i think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy. 
<s> i get the joke. sophisticated as it was. now the thing i wanna say is... maybe we should have talked about this before. us living together, you're not expecting a proposal, right? 
<phoebe> oh no! no no! not at all. we're just moving in right now. see where it goes. 
<s> yeah well, that's the thing. for me it's as far as it can ever go. 
<phoebe> what do you mean? 
<s> look. phoebe, i-i love you. very much. but i never want to get married again. 
<phoebe> oh. wow. 
<s> it's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. i kind of lost faith in the whole idea. 
<phoebe> was it really that bad? 
<s> at one point near the end she deliberately defecated..... 
<phoebe> ok, well that's bad. but don't you think it might be different with someone else? perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. except for once in the ocean. 
<s> look it's not about who i would marry. and i was certain the first time i got married it would last forever. and i was totally wrong! 
<phoebe> but it's just... 
<s> look phoebe, it's not about you. i just never wanna get married again. 
<phoebe> oh! 
<s> i'm sorry. are you ok with that? cause if not...maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea. 
<phoebe> no! i definitely don't wanna get married. no i just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. whew! coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister! 
<s> trust me, i will never... 
<phoebe> yeah i get that. 
< 
<rachel> hi! 
<monica> so you gave in and decided to call someone? 
<rachel> yeah, i don't know who i was kidding. i can barely use chopsticks. 
<s> you're all set.  
<rachel> oh thank you so much.  oh oh wait! you forgot your erm...your game.  
<s> thanks.....  
<chandler> hey rach! there she is...my perfectly proportioned wife. 
<rachel> don't look at me i never get his jokes. 
<monica> thank you? 
<chandler> oh no..don't thank me. thank you. you know there's not one thing i would change about you? not one single thing! and definitely not... two... single things. 
<monica> ok, you're being wierd. do you want sex or did you do something bad? 
<chandler> no no! i just love the way you look,  i am warm, for your form. 
<monica> ok..you know the old classics you know,you look nice? they're still ok. 
<chandler> well yes yes... you look nice can mean that your face looks nice. i want to compliment your body. i mean..i wouldn't change it. at all. and more specifically, i wouldn't want anything to get any bigger. 
<monica> okay... 
<chandler> i mean, you wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? don't answer that.  
<rachel> just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder. 
<monica> i know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger? 
<rachel> i don't know! i mean, what brought that on? 
<monica> oh my god. we're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change. 
<rachel> no you really think that's what it is? 
<monica> you heard him! "no bigger!" "you're perfect!" "just don't get any bigger!" oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. you know what? i'm going to have to talk to chandler. 
<rachel> yeah! if you don't i will! of course your body's gonna change. your breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose bladder control.  god! it's just such a magical time! 
< 
<phoebe> hi 
<ross> hey! 
<phoebe> listen, i wanted to ask you something about marriage. 
<ross> oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? i mean i can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!

<ross> why? 
<phoebe> mike doesn't ever wanna get married. 
<ross> never? 
<phoebe> never. 
<ross> wow, are you still going to move in with him? 
<phoebe> i want to, but i just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. you know that i won't, i won't be missing out on anything. that marriage stinks! 
<ross> yeah, marriage... stinks! i mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? get them married. 
<phoebe> that's not how you really feel is it? 
<ross> no, i'm sorry. look i don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but i can't help it. i love marriage. 
<phoebe> seriously? you divorce-o? 
<ross> if you have to call me name, i prefer "ross the divorcer". it's just cooler. look, i know my marriage isn't exactly work out. but i love to be that committed to another person. and carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. i'm sorry. 
<phoebe> it's ok that's how you feel. 
<ross> but come on! i mean living together will be great! i mean you guys have so much fun and you love mike. 
<phoebe> i do love mike. 
<ross> yeah see? and you are so excited about moving in together before, and you know what? you should be. it's a big deal! 
<phoebe> yeah i guess you're right. yeah thanks. this helped. thanks.

<chandler> your ass?!?!? 
<rachel> man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too! 
<chandler> they...do that? 
<monica> it's kind of a package deal! 
<chandler> god why why would you want to do that to yourself!? 
<monica> i thought i was something that we both wanted! 
<chandler> alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. but the giant ass and the big clown feet? 
<rachel> oh my god chandler! if you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? with the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!? 
<chandler>  what? 
< 
<rachel> joey! why did you tell chandler that monica was getting a boob job? 
<joey> because she is! 
<monica> joey, chandler knows i borrowed the money. 
<joey> mmmm hmm! for your boob job!

<s> very cool. 
<ross> hey pheebs, you know i'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and i hope i was a little helpful. 
<phoebe> oh yeah you were helpful! yeah, no, thanks you. 
<ross> good, good. yeah coz the more i thought about it, the more i realised i don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you. 
<phoebe> what do you mean? 
<ross> well, i know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? i mean can you honestly picture yourself in a volvo? 
<phoebe> they are awfully boxy... 
<ross> i don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. i mean it's so... normal. 
<phoebe> uh huh.  
<ross> hey hey, can i help? 
<chandler> well! we er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky. 
<ross> you know sometimes your words... they hurt. 
<joey> hey uh, where do you guys want this? 
<rachel> yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy.  i mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys. 
<phoebe> just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle room? none at all? 
<s> no but... you don't want to get married either right? 
<phoebe> right. except that i do want to get married. 
<joey>  couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh? 
<s> you wanna get married? 
<phoebe> someday. 
<chandler> aaaaand....... hernia. 
<phoebe> i haven't exactly had a normal life and i never really felt i was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff. 
<s> but if you wanna get married why didn't you say something before? 
<phoebe> because i just didn't know how much i wanted it. and i love you, and i wanted to live with you. 
<s> i want to live with you too! let's do that! 
<phoebe> but i don't think i can! it was ok to move in when i didn't know what was gonna happen, but i can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen. 
<s> can we at least try living together? i mean you might change your mind about marriage. 
<phoebe> are you gonna change yours? 
<s> no. 
<phoebe> me neither. i think i need to be with someone who wants what i want. 
<s> but i don't want this to end. 
<phoebe> i don't want it to end either. 
<s> i can't believe this is gonna end. i guess i'll have my stuff packed up. 
<phoebe> yeah.

<joey> hey ross, check this out!  yeah, i can't do that! 
<chandler> what are you doin'? 
<ross> have you seen this? it's a new alumni website for college! it's cool! you can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to. 
<chandler> great, a faster way to tell people that i'm unemployed and childless . 
<ross> it's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember andrea rich? 
<chandler> the tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you? 
<ross> uh uh... well, her internet company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident... 
<chandler> bet she'd sleep with you now... 
<ross> no... i already e-mailed her. 
<chandler> let me see what you wrote about yourself two kids... "  you split with carol because you have different interests?... i think you split with carol because you've one very similar interest! 
<ross> you know what? i'm gonna finish this later, ok? let me just grab my coat. 
<joey> hey!  
<ross>  what do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes??  
<chandler> maybe we finish this for him!  "also i cloned a dinosaur in my lab. she's now my girlfriend. i don't care what society says. it's the best sex i've ever had"... aaand send! 
<joey>  no, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him! 
<ross>  alright, let's go! 
<joey> dude!  
<ross> i think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house! 
<joey>  aaand send!  opening credits 
< 
<rachel> hey! how was basketball? 
<joey> oh, it was a lot of fun right up until chandler got a finger in the eye! 
<rachel> oh, no! who did that? 
<joey> chandler... hey...  rach... what's hugsy doin' in the crib with emma?  
<rachel> she was just crawling around and she found him, so i just let her sleep with him. that's all right? isn't it? 
<joey>  oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... i know that! 
<rachel> joey... are you sure? i mean, i know how much you love him! 
<joey> rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? i do not love hugsy. i like him a normal amount... 
<rachel> all right... oh, emma loves him! 
<joey> why wouldn't she? he's a wonderful person! 
< 
<phoebe> hi. 
<monica> hey phoebe... how you doin'? you feelin' better? 
<phoebe> breaking up sucks! oh, i really miss mike! 
<chandler> oh, i'm so sorry! 
<phoebe> oh god, i tried everything to make myself feel better. i even tried writing a song about it... but... i can't think of anything that rhymes with aarrgghh!!  hey monica, i really need your help getting through this... 
<chandler> you're not gonna need my help? 
<phoebe> well no, when i get to the point where... you know... i'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about mike... i'm gonna come to you. 
<chandler> oh good, 'cause i've already thought of 3... 4! i've just thought of a fourth  
<phoebe> ok. i mean i know i did the right thing. you know, mike never wants to get married and i shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon i'm gonna miss him so much. i'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that. 
<monica> ok, you got it! 
<phoebe>  unless... maybe it's too crazy about this... alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. you know what? forget what i said. 
<monica> really? if that's what you want... 
<phoebe> that was a test and you just failed. 
<monica> damn it! rookie mistake!  
<ross>  i have sex with dinosaurs?? 
<chandler> i believe i read that somewhere! 
<ross> that only is not funny, it's physically impossible! ok? depending on the species i'd have to have a six foot long...  it's not funny!! 
<chandler> i respectfully disagree. 
<ross> i can't believe you put that on my alumni page! 
<chandler> who cares? nobody reads those things 
<ross> you'd better hope not because i just read what you put on your page today. 
<chandler> i don't have a page. 
<ross> oh oh oh! i respectfully disagree!! 
< 
<joey> look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.  it's okay, emma, you stay asleep.  
<rachel>  i have a weapon! 
<joey> it's okay, it's okay rach, it's me. put down the scrunchy. 
<rachel> what are you doing? 
<joey> well, i heard emma stirring, so i came to make sure she could reach hugsy. 
<rachel> oh, oh thanks. alright well, now that i'm up i'm going to go to the bathroom. 
<joey>  there you go sweetie...  this isn't over. 
< 
<monica> alright, wait a second, why would ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...  "gay as the day is long"? 
<chandler> because i told everyone he slept with dinosaurs. 
<monica> but that's clearly a joke. this could easily be true.  
<chandler> would you get that please? people have been calling to congratulate me all day. 
<monica>  hello? no, he's not here. yeah, this is his wife. yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. i guess i should have known. yeah, i mean, he just kept making me watch moulin rouge. 
<chandler> hang up, hang up. and that was a great movie!  i'm so gonna get back at ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go . 
<monica> what are you doing? 
<chandler> oh, you'll see my friend. there. enter ross] 
<ross>  i'm dead? 
<chandler>  and so young. 
<ross> posting that i died? that really isn't funny. 
<chandler> well, how you died was funny. 
<ross> oh please, hit by a blimp? 
<chandler> it kills over one americans every year. 
<ross> unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think i'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. you're messing with people's feelings here. 
<chandler> you wanna talk about people's feelings? you should have heard how hurt professor stern was yesterday when i told him i wouldn't be able to go with him to key west! 
<ross> you've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause i'm on my way to buy some photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. that's right! your coming out is about to get real graphic. 
< 
<phoebe> god, i wish mike were here. 
<monica> okay if mike were here what would the two of you be doing?  
<monica> what are you, animals? it's 4 o'clock in the afternoon! 
<phoebe> i gotta call him. just to talk to him, there's no harm in that. 
<monica> phoebe, that's how it starts. i don't need to eat the cake, i'll just smell the icing... why don't i just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. and next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. phoebe, honey, i know this is hard. look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. and if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. i know that's not what you want.  give me your phone. 
<phoebe> here. 
<monica> and now your cell. 
<phoebe> okay  
<monica> this is your cellphone? 
<phoebe> yes. 
<monica> this is your current cellphone? 
<phoebe> yes, it reminds me of a simpler time. 
<monica> phoebe, where's your purse?  
<monica> no, no! give it to me! 
<phoebe> you can't have it. 
<monica> give it to me! 
<phoebe> no  
<monica> i'll go in there. 
<phoebe>  oh yeah. 
<monica> phoebe come here  
<monica> haha! 
<phoebe> damn you monica geller hyphen bing! 
< 
<joey> hey, look who's here! it's joey, and he brought home a friend. 
<rachel> joey, emma's right here! you promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore. 
<joey> no, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new hugsy! 
<rachel> oh that's so great, now emma has two hugsy's. 
<joey> no, no, emma has one hugsy, the new hugsy, huh? the other hugsy, i don't know, i guess i'll just take it back. 
<rachel> oh you know what? when i was a little girl i had a little pink pony named cotton. oh i loved her so much, i took her everywhere, i would braid her tail... 
<joey> make the transfer!  
<rachel> should i be concerned that a button fell off the old hugsy and i can't find it? 
<joey> oh, no don't worry about that, i swallowed that years ago.  
<rachel> oh, i don't think she likes the new hugsy. 
<joey> but he's the same. 
<rachel> yeah, i think she wants the old one back. 
<joey> but he's the same. 
<rachel> joey, come on! 
<joey> he's the same! . 
<joey>  you're not the same! 
< 
<monica> haha! 
<phoebe> you know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after i've buzzed you into the building. 
<monica> so phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door. 
<phoebe> those are my shoes. 
<monica> oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping. 
<phoebe> monica, i really appreciate you checking in on me, but i'm actually feeling a lot better. yeah, i just kinda want to be alone right now.  
<monica> who's that?  
<phoebe> i ordered chinese food.  
<phoebe> what are the chances? 1 billion chinese people and they send mike!? 
<monica>  what are you doing here? 
<s> phoebe called me. 
<monica> phoebe! 
<phoebe> i'm sorry, i broke down... i wanted to see him. 
<monica> damnit phoebe! how did you even call him? 
<phoebe> there is a speakerphone on the base unit... 
<monica> base unit! think monica! think! 
<s> look, if i wanna see phoebe and she wants to see... 
<monica>  this doesn't concern you!! 
<s> oh! sorry, i guess i was thrown off by the mention of my name! 
<monica> look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder. 
<phoebe> not if nothing happens. why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends? 
<monica> sure! if you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe i'll join ya. you know, i'm your friend  and mike's friend . 
<phoebe> sit down.  
<monica> oh wow wow wow!! make room for your friend!  
<s>  so how've you been? 
<monica> i've been pretty good! 
<s>  you look really beautiful. 
<phoebe> thanks, you look good too. 
<monica> oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. keep it clean! 
<phoebe> so how's the piano playing going? 
<s> actually i've been playing a lot of love songs lately. i've missed you. 
<phoebe> i've missed you too.  
<monica> you know, on the way over here, i saw this drunk guy throw up. and then a pigeon ate it! 
< 
<chandler> hey, ross, i just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me? 
<ross> uhu uhu, check this out.  
<chandler> huh! so that's what i would look like if i worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. you're not actually going to send these out are ya? 
<ross> eh..actually no, i don't need to because your little "ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that i'm dead.  oh my god! nobody cares that i'm dead!? 
<chandler> no, come on, you know that's not true. 
<ross> what are you talking about? you get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! i didn't get one response! and i'm dead! 
<chandler> well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community. 
<ross> i can't believe this. not even my geology lab partner? and i carried that guy!  
<chandler> alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? that people are gonna post condolences on a website? this is not about people not caring that you're dead .this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief. 
<ross> you're right. there isn't a decent outlet. 
<chandler> right, i mean, come on, i'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come. 
<ross> exactly!!  
<chandler> ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? you're having a memorial service for yourself!? 
<ross> no! that would be stupid! you're having it for me! 
<chandler> ross, don't press send, don't press se... ! 
<ross> oh, too late, too late! it's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man... 
< 
<rachel> i'm trying to put emma down for a nap, have you seen hugsy? 
<joey> original or crappy? 
<rachel> original. 
<joey> no, sorry haven't seen him. 
<rachel> then what's that big lump under your covers? 
<joey> it's monica, ok? 
<rachel> that's not monica! 
<joey> alright!! fine! it's original hugsy! no, now i know that emma wants him but he's mine and i need him.. 
<rachel>  oh god. 
<joey> ... she's being unreasonable! 
<rachel>  joey, there is a reason that emma loves that stupid penguin so much  oh don't cover its ears!  it's because it reminds her of her uncle joey! 
<joey> it does? 
<rachel> yeah! and she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle joey so much. 
<joey> really? she... she loves me? 
<rachel> oh yeah! but you know what? if you need hugsy, don't worry. emma will totally understand. i won't... but whatever . 
<joey> ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, i mean rach, i mean if if... . if hugsy means that much to emma then... well she can have him. 
<rachel> oooh... you're sweet, i knew uncle joey would step up.  look emma, look who's baaack! 
<joey> look forget it forget it... i can't do it. 
<rachel> are you gonna... you're going to take hugsy away from a little child? 
<joey> how do you think i got him in the first place? 
<  
<monica> alright you two, i'm gonna go to the bathroom. now i don't want fungus and the idea of me and ross doing it. 
<s> i've missed you so much! no, i'm not gonna ask you to get back together because i know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night. 
<phoebe> i know, i want that too, but is that going to make it too hard? 
<s> it can't be any harder than this... i mean, if i had known the last time i saw you would be the last time, i... i would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. if i had known the last time i kissed you would have been the last time... i never would have stopped. 
<monica>  kiss him, you fool!! 
<phoebe> what? 
<monica> didn't you hear that speech? if you don't kiss him then i will! 
<phoebe> oh, i missed you so much!  
<s> oh, crap! 
<phoebe> who is this? 
<s> my friend manny. i asked him to keep me away from you. 
<monica> hi, that's what i'm doing for phoebe! 
<s> well, you are not doing a very good job! 
<monica> excuse me? 
<s> what's with the kissing? 
<monica> hey, at least i knew where my guy was. 
<s> oh yeah yeah, thank god you were here to oversee all the kissing! 
<monica> you didn't hear the speech! 
<s> i've heard the speech gonna be the last time he saw her... " 
<monica> hey, it was very moving! you're just heartless! 
<s> you're weak! 
<monica> you're... weird! 
<s> your pants are undone! 
<monica> oh ! 
<s>  where did they go? 
<monica> damn it! 
<s> oh we blew it. i blame myself. 
<monica> and i blame you too. 
< 
<ross> it's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! i tell you, when i actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!  
<chandler> there you go! someone came! 
<ross> ok, ok! i'm gonna go hide! oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!   
<monica> hi, glad you could come. 
<chandler>  please, come in. 
<s> hi, you're chandler bing, right? i'm tom gordon, i was in your class. 
<chandler> oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat. 
<s> thanks... uh... i'm so sorry about ross, it's... 
<chandler> at least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps  
<ross> who is he? 
<chandler> some guy, tom gordon. 
<ross> i don't remember him, but then again i touched so many lives.  
<monica> so, did you know ross well? 
<s> oh, actually i barely knew him. yeah, i came because i heard chandler's news. d'you know if he's seeing anyone? 
<monica>  yes, he is. me. 
<s> what? you... you... oh! can i ask you a personal question? ho-how do you shave your beard so close? 
<chandler>  ok tommy, that's enough mourning for you! here we go, bye bye!!  
<s>  hey, listen. call me. 
<chandler> ok!  
<ross>  i'm dead and no one cares? 
<monica> i look like a man?? 
<chandler> please, one ridiculous problem at a time! 
<ross> it isn't ridiculous, look around! no one's here! 
<chandler> you gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and monica... it's probably the way you stand! 
<ross> yes, you're right. still somebody must have seen it... i mean, i went to that school for 4 years, i didn't have an impact on anyone? 
<chandler> oh, that's not true. you had an impact on me, i mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. doesn't that count for something? 
<ross>  yeah...  oh, great. more party boys for chandler! 
<chandler> i'm sure it's somebody for you. now, go hide.   
<s> hi. i'm here for ross geller's memorial service. 
<chandler> kori? kori weston? 
<s> yeah... 
<chandler> wow! you look amazing! 
<s> and you are... 
<chandler> chandler, chandler bing. i'm not gay, i'm not gay at all. 
<monica> you are married though. 
<chandler> don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood!  
<s> i can't believe that ross is gone. it is just so sad. 
<chandler> i didn't know ross and you were so close. 
<s> we weren't but we had one class together. he was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. i always remembered him. 
<chandler> i'm sure that would mean a lot to him. and if heaven has a door, i'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently. 
<s> i thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. i guess i really missed my chance. 
<ross>  but you didn't! i'm still alive!! kori, i know this is a big surprise for you. it's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! i mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people! 
<s> you sick freak, who does that? i can't believe i had a crush on you!  
<ross> did you hear that? kori weston had a crush on me!! ending credits 
< 
<ross>  no mum, i'm not dead. i know it's not something to kid about. it was just a practical joke between chandler and me, but it's over, ok?  actually no, even if i had died, you would not be left childless.  monica? friends greatest sitcom 
< 
<joey> monica, hey, can i borrow the porsche? 
<monica> ok. 
<joey> alright! 
<monica> but ehm...what is it not? 
<joey>  a place to entertain my lady friends. 
<monica> and what else is it not? 
<joey>  a place to eat spaghetti. 
<monica> very good!  what do you need it for anyway? 
<joey> oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in new york, so... 
<rachel> oh! so you're driving up to connecticut? 
<joey> yeah connecticut...not west virginia. 
<monica> hey, maybe i'll drive you up there! i'd like to buy some tickets myself! 
<joey> uh! 
<monica> yeah with chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars. 
<chandler> yeah, because if i was at my old job we'd say 300 million? no thank you! 
<phoebe> hey will you get me tickets too? 
<rachel> yeah me too. oh! i have an idea. why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it! 
<ross> no thanks! 
<phoebe> you don't wanna win the lottery? 
<ross> uh...sure i do, and i also wanna be king of my own country and find out what happened to amelia earhart. 
<chandler> still on amelia earhart? 
<ross> the woman just vanished! 
<joey> seriously, ross, you don't want in on this? 
<ross> no! do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? i...i mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times. 
<chandler> yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times. 
<joey> i like those odds! 
<ross> seriously you guys, i can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, i mean that's such a bunch of boohaki. 
<chandler> i'll ask.  boohaki? 
<ross> oh oh, we think emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her. 
<rachel> yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker. 
<monica> how do you know she's gonna start talking? 
<rachel> well when i talk to her i almost feel like she understands what i'm saying. 
<chandler> kinda like joey. 
<joey> what's that now? opening credits 
< 
<monica> god! look at all these tickets! it's so exciting! you know i haven't won anything since the sixth grade. 
<chandler> pie eating contest? 
<monica> oh! you assume because i was heavy that's the only way i could win something? 
<chandler> no, i saw a picture of you covered in blueberries. 
<monica> that was a good day!  
<ross> they're towing your car, they're towing your car!! 
<monica> i'm parked in a garage on morton! 
<ross> they're towing a car. and i am seeing...spots.

<rachel> joey relax! my mother picked her up two hours ago. you were there! 
<joey> i was? 
<s> yes and you talked to her... 
<joey> i did? 
<rachel> she dropped off a casserole? 
<joey> oh yeah! the casserole lady. 
<monica> so, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks? 
<ross> yeah, uh... and then i figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!  
<chandler> don't touch the phone! i'll get it, i'll get it, i'll get it!!  
<ross> think he washed his hands? 
<chandler> hello? hey charlie, what do you know? 
<rachel> what's going on? 
<monica> chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. but out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three. 
<joey> ooh! tough odds! 
<ross> yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery! 
<joey> look who's coming around! 
<chandler> damnit. alright call me when you know more. 
<joey> did you get it? 
<chandler> one of the slots got filled. 
<joey> by you!? 
<chandler> sense the tone! no that kid nate got it. 
<monica> oh! i hate that guy! i mean come on kid! pull up your pants! 
<chandler> yeah i know. 
<rachel> well, there's two spots left right? 
<chandler> yeah...i mean i want this so much! i mean, i wanna get one, i want my friend charlie to get one...except i don't care about charlie.  
<phoebe> hey you guys! ok, you're not going to believe this! i just saw my psychic and she said i was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight! 
<monica> hey that reminds me, i thought we could use some extra luck so i brought a wishbone home from work. 
<ross> a psychic and a wishbone? guys! give someone else a chance! 
<monica> alright, who wants to do it? 
<phoebe> oh can i? vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. it's really not fair either! you know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses! 
<monica> ok, hey rach? 
<rachel> oh no, i'm good, i don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands. 
<joey> i'll do it!! it'll get the casserole stink off of mine.  
<phoebe> i hope i win! 
<monica> well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right? 
<joey> i can't tell you what i'm wishing for! else...you know...won't come true! 
<monica> right! .. but we "know" what you're wishing for! 
<joey> can't really say! 
<monica> i understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you? 
<joey> i'm not really comfortable with these questions! 
<phoebe> one, two, three!  
<joey> i won, hey! 
<ross> you know what, i'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp!  ah!! that thing gets hot!! 
<rachel> you know, ross, just keep making your jokes. how are you gonna feel if we actually do win? 
<ross> uh, you're not gonna win. 
<rachel> oh, i know, i know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! and then how you gonna feel? you know, we're gonna be all like "oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape" and you're gonna be all like "oh, i can't guys, i'll meet you guys up there, i gotta gas up the hyundai" 
<ross> ok, i've heard myself on tape and i sound nothing like that. 
<chandler> i can see the headline now with regret eats own arm". 
<ross> why would i eat my own arm? 
<chandler> well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want. 
<monica> you know what, ross? i'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you. 
<ross> why? 
<monica> because i know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. and you're my brother, and i want you to be a part of this. 
<ross> you don't have to do that, i'll pay for myself. but just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! come here  
<phoebe> get a room! 
<chandler> ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win? 
<ross> i don't know, probably just invest it. 
<chandler> ooh! calm down ... 
<joey> seriously, that's your fantasy? to invest it? 
<ross> oh, i'm sorry, did i say "invest it"? i meant "be cool and piss it all away"  
<joey> ooh, ooh, i know! we should pool all own money and buy the knicks! 
<rachel> i don't really care about the knicks. 
<joey> oh, you will when i pick you as starting forward. 
<rachel>  you would do that? i never get picked! 
<chandler> you know, i'm not sure a sports team is the way to go. 
<joey> you're not gonna let me buy the knicks?? i can't believe you're taking this away from me! 
<chandler> you're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds. 
<ross>  uh, how long until they announce the numbers, mommy?  
<chandler>  i'll take this one too  uh ... mommy? 
<ross> oh, i've gotten into the habit of calling rachel "mommy" when we're around emma. which i now realize we are not ... 
<rachel> i'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word. 
<ross> although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me "daddy" too. 
<phoebe> oooh, i like that, "daddy"  
<ross> i ... i was just talking about rachel. 
<phoebe>  oooh, is daddy getting angry? is daddy gonna spank me? 
<ross>  well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi ..  no i can't.  
<chandler> hello? hello? oh, hey charlie. did anybody else hear? ... what? susan got it?? how? oh man, i would have slept with him!! .. alright, bye.  
<joey> dude, i'm sorry. but hey, there's one spot left, right? 
<chandler> well no, charlie's gonna get that. 
<monica> hey, don't say that! you got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job! 
<chandler> he's the boss's son. 
<monica> come on, lottery!!  
<rachel> ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes. 
<monica> ok, here we go. we need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. so does anybody have any ideas how to organize of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first. 
<rachel> ooh, i have another idea! 
<monica> i'm sorry, idea time is over. 
<phoebe> ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl? 
<monica> yeah. 
<chandler> what about the ones you have on the nightstand? 
<monica> there are no tickets on the nightstand! 
<chandler> yes there are, i just saw them a few minutes ago.  
<monica> un, no you didn't! you must be mistaken! 
<chandler> honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand! 
<monica> chandler, sense the tone!!  
<rachel> well, well, well, look what mommy found!!  
<monica> ok, fine!! i bought 20 extra tickets for me and chandler. 
<phoebe> uh! the psychic also said that i would be betrayed. 
<ross> i can't believe this, i thought we were all in this together! 
<monica> hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago! 
<ross> 3 minutes ago!!! i don't know why that's important ... 
<joey> i was with you the whole time we were in connecticut, when did you even get those? 
<monica> when you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic! 
<joey>  i'll show you how. 
<rachel> ok, well monica, suppose one of your "special" tickets win? how are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends? 
<monica> please ... if i win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and i couldn't get rid of you for 3 days! 
<rachel> chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong? 
<chandler>  she's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ... 
<monica> ahhh!  
<chandler> let me finish ...  however, it doesn't look like i'm gonna get this job so i can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!!  
<monica> there's the man i married!! 
<rachel> all right, believe me.if you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us! 
<monica> fine! don't be my friends! i'll buy new friends! yeah, and then i'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you! 
<rachel>  oh! alright, you know what? that's it! i want my share of the tickets ! 
<joey> yeah, i want my tickets too ! and i'm buying the knicks! and steffi graff, ah ah! 
<ross> than i want mine, too ! and if i win i'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond. 
<phoebe> oh, you guys! we've got to keep all the tickets together  
<monica> no, no! we should divide them up  and i should get extra because we used my card to buy them! 
<joey> hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! this all thing was my idea!  
<chandler> oh, yeah! thanks for inventing the lottery! 
<rachel> ok, that's it! just give'em to me! i'll split them up!  
<joey>  oh! 
<phoebe>  ooooohhhhh! 
<ross>  hey, hey!! 
<phoebe>  ooooohhhhh!  fine, i can't take it anymore! i'm putting an end to this!  
<rachel> oh, if she jumps, i get her tickets. 
<joey> no, no!  
<phoebe> if we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! so, say goodbye to your tickets! . 
<s> no!! 
<phoebe> don't come any closer! 
<chandler> can i come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished... 
<phoebe> no, what's more important, your friends or money? 
<monica> money!  friends... 
<phoebe> hey monica, what about your extra tickets? 
<monica> they're all in there! even these five that i hid in my bra ... 
<ross> monica! 
<phoebe> ok, good!  you guys were so scared! there was no way i was gonna dump this... oh god, no!  i think i broke your bowl. 
<ross> go, go, go!! 
<  
<phoebe> what a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. and the wind sure made it fun. 
<monica> phoebe, we lost half of them. 
<phoebe> so, what? monica, we have the winning ticket! my psychic said i was gonna win, remember? 
<ross> weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon... 
<phoebe> as a matter of fact she said that's how i am going to die.  so, excuse me for being a little skittish. 
<chandler>  hey, there's two messages. these could be from work! 
<monica> oh, play them! 
<chandler> ok, here we go!  
<s>  "hello. th-this is the pigeon from the balcony calling to apologise"  "i sh.. i shouldn't have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady's hand. it-it was all my fault. not hers. bye. coo."  
<phoebe> well, i bet that was very hard for him to do. 
<chandler> this is..shhh! sorry man, it was a lot of fun working with you. give me a call if you want." 
<monica> oh god, i am so sorry honey... 
<s> oh, so sorry man! sorry! 
<rachel> oh, it is so unfair. it's like that time they promoted sandra over me at work. 
<chandler> oh, is she related to ralph lauren? 
<rachel> no, she was just much better at job than me! 
<phoebe> guys, the drawing is about to start! 
<rachel>  you know what? we should call my mum's house and say goodnight to emma before she goes down. 
<ross> oh yeah, it's a good idea! 
<monica>  honey, you've been really strong about this, i know how badly you wanted that job. 
<chandler> yeah, you know, i really thought i deserved it.  but... let's go win the lottery... i mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right? 
<monica>  131!  
<ross>  goodnight sweetheart! i love you. and remember, you're daddy's little girl...  phoebe's totally ruined that for me...  
<rachel> hi mum, put her back on! 
<joey>  rach, come on! they are announcing the numbers! my god, i can already feel myself changing. 
<s> "here we are, the official powerball numbers! we have 53"

<ross> oh, we have one too!! 
<monica> we are on a roll, people!! 
<ross>  come on!! 
<rachel>  mum, please!i know you love your new lips, but i can barely understand you! would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter? 
<s> "and number 29! here we go! the powerball is 7" 
<monica> check your numbers! make me rich! 
<rachel>  guys, you're not gonna believe this! i was just saying goodnight to emma and she said her first words!! 
<s> wow! 
<joey> and what did she say? 
<rachel> she said "gleba"!!   
<monica> make me rich!! 
<rachel>  isn't that amazing? 
<ross> oh yeah, no no no...that's great! 
<rachel> why-why aren't you more excited? 
<ross> oh, rach...oh..."gleba" is not a word. 
<rachel> oh, but of course it is! 
<ross> okay, what does it mean? 
<rachel> i don't know all the words. 
<ross> i'm just, i'm just glad i didn't miss my daughter's first words . 
<ross> yes you did, gleba is a word! 
<ross> ok, use it in a sentence. 
<rachel> ok... "emma just said gleba"! 
<ross> it's not a word! 
<rachel> okay, okay, okay, fine, i'm gonna look it up . 
<ross> oh, oh, ok, great. you know what, while you're at it she said  
<rachel>  alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba... fungi.  
<ross> she's gonna be a scientist!

<phoebe> i'm still looking through mine... 
<monica> just double checking ...no, no, no... no!  
<monica>  hello? hold on. it's your boss. 
<chandler> ah, the "i'm sorry i rejected you" phone call. i'm not used to getting it from guys.  hey, steve. 
<s> chandler, hi! i'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions. we just felt that with your maturity and experience, you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant. 
<chandler> oh no no no no, i'd love to be somebody's assistant! answering phones, getting coffee, i live for that stuff! and i'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks! 
<s> chandler, you were the strongest person in the program. we're offering you the position of junior copywriter. 
<chandler> me, that guy who just said butt cracks? 
<s> yes, that's right. we're excited about the level of sophistication you'll be bringing to the job. 
<chandler> ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. i'll see you tomorrow .  
<chandler> what?  oh, yeah, i'm gonna be a junior copywriter.

<chandler> thanks, man. 
<joey> and i like to think i had a little something to do with it. 
<chandler> really? what? 
<joey> well, before, with the wishbone... i didn't wish we would win the lottery, i wished you'd get the job. 
<chandler>  oh yeah?  listen, don't tell monica, she'll rip your heart right out. 
<joey> oh yeah. 
<rachel> you know what? there is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win. 
<ross> me too. so much for my dinosaur/amelia earhart theme park. 
<phoebe> you guys, what was the powerball number again? 
<phoebe> we won. 
<rachel> what? 
<phoebe> we won! 
<monica> let me see!  
<phoebe> don't tear it. 
<ross> phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers. 
<phoebe> i know that, but look, we've got the powerball number, we've won 3 dollars! 
<chandler> wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout. 
<phoebe>  i don't care, i've never won anything before, i can't believe this! 
<rachel> so pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3? 
<phoebe> it's not all mine. we all get 50 cents. 
<monica> you know what? you can have mine. 
<chandler> me too.

<phoebe>  coo, again. don't blame the pretty lady. it was not her fault. it was me, the pigeon, coo!  seriously, stop staring at her.

<ross> what did you get? 
<chandler> usa today 
<ross> nice, put it with the others. 
<chandler> and i also got... two more apples. 
<ross> we are four short of a bush-o . god i feel so alive, i love being in the country! 
<chandler> i also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant. 
<ross> oh, that's not cool. 
<s> dude, none of this is cool. 
<ross> no, chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking conditioners, yes, yes, yes.  now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt  i wish i'd thought this through. 
<chandler> i think i know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that. 
<ross> not my first time in a hotel, my friend. 
<chandler> ok, how about this ? 
<ross> no, no, no, you can't take the remote control! 
<chandler> yes, but the batteries...  
<chandler> thank you, thank you very much! 
<ross> let's celebrate with some maple candy! 
<chandler> no! 
<ross> at least tell me where you hid it. 
< 
<rachel> can i ask you a question? 
<monica> yeah. 
<rachel> have you ever had any weird romantic dreams? 
<monica> let me think. oh, when i was younger i used to dream that i got married to mayor mccheese, and on our wedding night i ate his head. 
<rachel> ok, well this is like that...in no way. i had a...i had a dream last night that i wanted to kiss joey. 
<monica> wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him? 
<rachel> oh yeah! i mean, that was pretty intense. 
<monica> what do you think brought than on? 
<rachel> i don't know! i mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that i saw him do a love scene yesterday. 
<monica> a love scene? with who? 
<rachel> olivia. 
<monica> olivia? i thought she was marrying connor!  oh right, real life more important. 
<rachel> so do you think that my dream means anything? 
<monica> i don't know. i mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for joey, maybe you have a thing for drake. 
<rachel> ah! well it was joey reading drake's lines in the dream... 
<monica> of course it was! trust me, when it comes to psychology i know what i'm talking about. i took two psych classes in college. 
<rachel> you took the same class twice. 
<monica> it was hard!  
<phoebe> hey! 
<phoebe> here, monica, look what i got to wear when i play at the restaurant  uh, huh wait!  right? i mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man. 
<monica> oh...phoebe? maybe i wasn't clear before. i really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place. 
<phoebe> right, yeah, ok, i'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault. 
<monica> phoebe, it's not what you wear. it's sort of your songs... i just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore. 
<phoebe> oh, ok. fine, i'll just, i'll take the hat back .  
<rachel> hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work... 
<phoebe> my songs aren't good enough for your restaurant? 
<rachel> ok, we're still on that. 
<monica> i didn't say your songs were not good enough. 
<phoebe> then what's wrong with them? would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food? 
<monica> tiny portions? 
<phoebe> yeah well, "excuse me, i ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but  i can't see it, i can't see it"! 
<monica> phoebe, it's not about quantity. 
<phoebe> well...it's not about quality. 
<monica> oh really, you want to talk about quality? have you heard of a key? it's what some people sing in. 
<phoebe> well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. yeah, there are other ingredients monica. 
<monica> ok, so that's what we're doing. you know, when i'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, i'm wearing ear plugs. 
<phoebe> ear plugs, or cloves of garlic? 
<monica> you know what? i take back what i said before. you keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy. 
<phoebe> what are people having, the garlic martini? 
< 
<s> here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay. 
<chandler> oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.  
<chandler> oh, i didn't factor in the room tax. 
<ross> oh dude, don't worry about it, i found an unattended maid's car. we're way ahead of the game.  
<ross> oh my god.

<monica> thank god, it's just you! i thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall. 
<phoebe> you'd better get back in that kitchen monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself. 
<monica> ok, you have to stop playing now. 
<phoebe> why? the only person my playing is bothering is you! 
<monica> oh yeah? ok, let's settle this, come on! 
<phoebe>  get your garlic-peelers off me! 
<monica>  excuse me, excuse me, hi, i'm monica geller..i'm the head chef here.. .. ok, i was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! ok, quick 
<s> by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside?  
<phoebe> ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside?  ha! 
<monica> alright, let me ask you this question the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? . 
<phoebe> ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky? 
<monica> ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone?  
<phoebe> ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? . 
<monica> excuse us!  alright here's a question so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now?  
<phoebe> oh...who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great!  
<monica> i'm sorry... 
<phoebe> i'm sorry too...  
<monica> ooohh... hey! wanna stick around and i'll whip you up some dinner? 
<phoebe> yeah! as long as it's free! food here is ridiculously over-p...  
<phoebe>  who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me? 
< 
<rachel> hey! 
<joey> hey! 
<rachel> joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head? 
<joey>  oh man! i thought i got it all! 
<rachel>  how...how...? 
<joey> i was making a peanut butter smoothy, right? 
<rachel> uh-huh 
<joey> and i couldn't find this little plastic thing  that goes on top of the blender...and i thought...well... how important can that be, right...? turns out very! 
<rachel>  wow...definitely just drake... 
<joey> what? 
<rachel> what...how is it going with drake? 
<joey> oh...i don't think it's going very well... 
<rachel> what...that scene i saw was so good! 
<joey> well, i'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow... 
<rachel> joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so i'll give you a compliment? 
<joey> a little. yeah no, i really am worried, you know, i mean i have to make it convincing that i'm in love with olivia. 
<rachel> so? 
<joey> so...i've never played that! 
<rachel> ooh! honey, it can't be that hard, i mean, you've been in love before? 
<joey> uh...well...just once...with you... 
<rachel> ok...this could be a little awkward...i'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance? 
<joey>  what the hell are you talking about?? 
<rachel>  alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene. 
<joey>  oh! ok, yeah, i think i can do that. yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and olivia and her husband are there and all drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... and that makes me think about all those times when i wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so i would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me. 
<rachel>  joey, you never..you never talked about that before... 
<joey> well.. hey, you know what else i could use? there's a scene where drake sneaks into olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! and he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know?  and i remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when i would think to myself, my god, she...is... beautiful...  and it hurts so much, cuz i knew i could never tell you  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.  
<joey>  thanks dude!!!this is great!!  closing credits

<joey> it's a one-woman play called "why don't you like me woman's journey through life". 
<monica> it sounds interesting!

<rachel> no, one of them...

<s> oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us? 
<ross> i don't think so. 
<s> i'm pretty sure, professor spafford from cornell?

<s> actually, alby is the guy i broke up with. 
<ross> you... you dated albert wintermeyer? 
<s> yeah... 
<ross> ... and you called him alby!?  i mean that's like... like calling albert einstein... er... alby... 
<s> yeah, well, he is a brilliant man. 
<ross> eh, you think? i mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10! 
<s> yes! and while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues... 
<ross>  oh! like what?!  oh i'm sorry, i don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch "access hollywood". 
<s> ok, you want the dirt? alby was seriously insecure. i mean, he was really intimidated by the guy i dated before him. 
<ross> who is intimidating to a guy who won the nobel prize? 
<s> a guy who won two. 
<ross>  two? wha...? don't tell me you dated benjamin hobart

<ross>  oh great! after i finish my wine i'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out. 
<phoebe> oh, what's the matter?

<rachel> i always loved that!! 
<ross> of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!!  man, i can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my god! 
<phoebe> worse? 
<ross> oh much, much worse. i did my impression of joan rivers as one of the earliest amphibians...  "can we walk"?  oh, you... you like that?

<joey>  what have you got there? 
<ross> just some boys gave me their phone numbers. 
<joey> ah, let me see!  damn, that's a lot of guys! are you a little slutty? 
<rachel>  i think i am. 
<joey>  let me see if i approve any of these clowns. this guy wears a rug . this guy's canadian . and this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and i don't feel any different.  
<joey>  pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass... 
<rachel>  why, why, what's wrong with these guys? 
<joey> nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best. 
<rachel> joey, you're so sweet. 
<joey> that's true. but you know what, it doesn't matter because i already know who you're gonna go home with tonight. 
<rachel> who ?  
<joey> me. 
<rachel>  what?  really? 
<joey> yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke! 
<rachel> oh! screw it, i didn't get it!  
<joey> gotcha. 
<rachel> oh, very funny... joey.   
<chandler>  so, how did you enjoy the play? 
<monica> oh my god, honey, i'm so so so so so sorry. 
<chandler> well you should be. you missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater. 
<monica> you really liked it? 
<chandler> oh yeah! i mean at first i hated it, but why wouldn't i, because as a man i've been trained  not to listen!  
<monica> oh really! 
<chandler> oh yeah, i had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! tell me, tell me about your first period! 
<monica> no! 
<chandler> did somebody sign your bra? 
<monica> so i got it when i was 13... 
< 
<phoebe> hey ross! so listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of nobel prizes scare you off? what is that, come on, a piece of paper? 
<ross> it's actually a 1,000,000$ prize. 
<phoebe> go charlie! but my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average joe phd. 
<ross> yeah, maybe. i do have my whole career in front of me. i mean, i can still win a nobel prize. although the last two papers i've written were widely discredited. 
<phoebe> you're so much more than just brains! you're sweet, and kind, and funny... 
<ross> and sexy. 
<phoebe> ok well give her a chance to see all of that! 
<ross> yeah, you're right, thanks pheebs, i'm gonna go find her. 
<phoebe> good for you! and hey, i thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the devonian era was top notch! 
<ross> stop going through my stuff !  
<rachel>  hey! 
<monica> hey! 
<rachel> i just wanted to let you know i've changed my mind do it, i'm gonna kiss joey. 
<monica> no, you can't! friends hooking up is a bad idea. 
<rachel> please, what about you and chandler? 
<monica> that's different! i was drunk and stupid! 
<rachel> well hello ! 
<monica> what about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? why don't you just kiss one of them? 
<rachel> i could, i could but i don't want to! i want to kiss joey! 
<monica> alright . i think it's a big mistake but it's your decision. 
<rachel>  i'm gonna do it. 
<monica> and i can't stop you. 
<rachel> no.  
<ross>  hey rach, have you seen charlie anywhere?

<monica> it's so weird, how did joey end up kissing charlie last night? i thought you'd end up kissing charlie. 
<ross> hey, i thought i'd end up kissing charlie too ok? but surprise! 
<chandler> i missed most of the party  charlie's a girl, right? 
<ross> yes, she is this new professor of my department that i did not kiss. 
<rachel> i don't know why joey had to kiss her! i mean, of all the girls at the party, god! 
<ross> why do you care so much? 
<monica> yes rachel, why do you care so much? 
<rachel>  be-cause ross is the father of my child! you know... and i... want him to hook up with lots of women!  i just... all i'm saying is... i don't think that joey and charlie have anything in common. 
<ross> oh, i don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils... 
<phoebe> wow, joey and a professor! can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and joey's raw sexual magnetism... oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid! 
<rachel> all right, so... ross, you're ok with all this? i mean... 
<ross> yeah, it's no big deal. i mean, i just met her and i'm fine with it...  
<ross> oh, god. i forgot how hot she was! 
<joey> hey! 
<s> hi! 
<ross> i'm gonna get some more coffee. 
<s> oh, you know what? i'll come with you! 
<ross> ok.  
<chandler>  so, a professor, uh? 
<joey> yeah! she is cool, and she's so smart! her mind is totally acrimonious .  that's not how she used it...? 
<s>  i feel like i owe you an explanation. i don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. i'm... well, i'm kind of embarrassed. i really hope you don't think less of me. 
<ross> uhm no! think less of you! no, i don't think less of you. i mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. i mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, i hate those people. 
<s> you know, actually i'm a little surprised to myself. i mean, joey is so different from the guys i usually date. i mean, they're all professors, and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you know, very cerebral... 
<ross> yeah, i know the type. 
<joey> hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. no? am i getting close? opening credits 
< 
<phoebe>  hey! 
<monica> hey! 
<phoebe> hey you guys! look what i just got.  
<rachel> oh, oh! wow, i love those! where did you get them? 
<phoebe> i bought them off ebay! they used to belong to the late shania twain. 
<rachel>  phoebe, shania twain is still alive! 
<phoebe> oh... then i overpaid.  
<monica> hey, what's this? 
<rachel> oh, it's a gift certificate to this new spa in soho. 
<monica> oh, you can't show phoebe this! she hates those corporate massage chains. 
<rachel> ah, why, now i can't get a massage? there are so many things that she disapproves of! i can't eat veal, i can't wear fur, i can't go hunting... 
<monica> do you wanna go hunting? 
<rachel> well, i would like to have the option!! 
<phoebe>  what's up?  hey, rachel!! 
<rachel> oh! 
<phoebe> no, you can't go there! you know how i feel about these "big massage places"! they're putting people like me out of business! 
<monica> and she wants to go hunting, too!! 
<rachel> phoebe, come on, i don't wanna waste it! it would be like throwing away a hundred bucks! 
<phoebe> ok, this is not about the money, ok? it's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells. 
<rachel> i don't care about any of that!! 
<phoebe> well, do you care about friendship? 
<rachel> oh! 
<phoebe> i feel really strongly about this, rachel. please, don't use this gift certificate. i'm asking you as a friend. 
<rachel> oh, not as a friend, phoebe!! fine, i won't use it! 
<phoebe> promise? 
<rachel> i promise. 
<phoebe> thank you.  
<rachel> but i am going hunting!! 
< 
<monica>  hey honey! i missed you today! 
<chandler> oh, yeah? 
<monica> yeah.  what d'you wanna do tonight? 
<chandler> oh, well... maybe we could...  
<monica> ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? know your audience! besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank. 
<chandler> we really need to take those tests? 
<monica> honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. i think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. just a few routine tests. 
<chandler> but i don't wanna do it in a cup! 
<monica> what is the big deal? 
<chandler> it's weird! in a doctor's office? 
<monica> it's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a taco bell? 
<chandler>  i cannot believe ross told you that!  and in my defense, it was a wendy's! 
<monica> look, i don't wanna do this test either, but i really do think it's a good idea! 
<chandler> yeah, ok. i'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the hershey's factory! 
<monica>  oh! 
<chandler> oh, yeah! rachel talks too! 
< 
<joey>  who says that wine has to cost more than milk!

<joey> yes. it's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls i've ever dated! combined! i don't want her to think i'm stupid! 
<ross>  are you wearing two belts? 
<joey>  eh, what do you know! 
<ross> you were saying you didn't want to seem stupid. 
<joey> right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and i don't know how to talk about that stuff. you gotta help me out!

<ross>  fine. 
<joey> thanks. 
<ross> ok. let's see. oh, you should take her to the met! 
<joey> the metsss! 
<ross> oh, no! the met! the metropolitan museum of art. 
<joey>  oh, that's what she meant!  you know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the muse! you know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion! 
<ross> yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans! 
<joey> ok, all right, so i'll take her to the met. 
<ross> yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on madison avenue. you know what? she loves architecture, you know what you should do? you should take a walk down fifth to the saint patrick's cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love. 
<joey> geez, sounds like you should be going on this date! 
<ross> but i'm not! . you know what if you're in the mood for thai food... 
<joey> whoa, whoa, whoa! slow down, you go way too fast. ok? just go back to the met, ok? 
<ross> ok. 
<joey> you got to tell me exactly what to do there. 
<ross> ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. ancient egypt, mesopotamia, up to the byzantine empire. 
<joey> whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! so, i walk in the door and make the right  
< 
<chandler> i have a weird feeling about this place.  how do i know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet. 
<monica> because, honey, i mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is gonna wanna watch that.  
<s> mr. bing?  here you are! you'll go into that room and deposit your specimen into the container. 
<chandler> deposit my specimen? you know, usually i have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. thanks, got it. 
<monica> hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok? 
<chandler> yeah, i guess! 
<monica> i know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! no one here even knows you! 
<s> oh my god!! 
<chandler> oh, come on! commercial break 
<s> ah ahahahhahaa! how great is this! 
<monica> hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home! 
<chandler> why are you here? 
<s> well, sid and i are trying again and we had trouble last time because apparently we... 
<chandler>  no no no... i mean, why? why is she here?? 
<s> oh! someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in a cup!  oh! they gave you the kiddy size . 
<chandler> what!?  
<monica> this was fun! but i've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!  
<chandler> i'd love to stay, but i have eh...  got a hot date...  
<s> please... go!  just let me know if you need a hand! 
<chandler>  i think it just fell off.  
< 
<phoebe>  hello "ja", it's time for your massage, ja! put your face in the hole. 
<rachel> wow, a swedish massage from a real swedish person.  
<phoebe> okay, then i'm swedish... 
<monica> so, what's your name? 
<phoebe> it's a normal swedish name... ikea... 
<rachel> oh... what an interesting name. 
<phoebe> ja! 
<rachel> you know i...  
<phoebe>  time for your scalp massage! 
<rachel>  wow... i really love your...  
<phoebe> is something wrong? 
<rachel> no, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... ikea...  yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of sweden? 
<phoebe>  uhm... stockholm. 
<rachel> damn! i wish i knew if that was right! 
< 
<joey>  note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself. 
<ross> now, do you have any idea what you just said? 
<joey> (shaking his head as if to say says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks! 
<ross> ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, monet is not spelt m-o-n-a-y. i just... i wrote that out phonetically for you. 
<joey> phonetically?  
<ross> yeah, yeah that means... you know? we just... we don't have time for this. 
<joey> ok. 
<ross> ok, but you know what? i gotta say, i'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly! 
<joey> ah! i'm an actor! i can memorize anything! last week on "days" i had to say "frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy". 
<ross> wow. what does that mean? 
<joey> no idea! but the guy i said it to dies in the next scene so i guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear". 
<ross> ok! so let's move on to the renaissance? 
<joey> ok, caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. touch it, it's really bumpy! . 
<ross> nah ah! nah ah!  no no no! no ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings. 
<joey> come on! you...  
<ross> no!  
< 
<chandler>  my specimen is in the room and i just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while i was in there. really helped speed the process along!  janice! you're not... gone? 
<s> oh! sid is still in his room. i don't allow porn at home so this is like a vacation for him. so did you do it? did you make your deposit? 
<chandler> yeah! yeah... the hard part is over! 
<s> that's not the hard part honey! the hard part is what comes next, i mean aren't you worried about the results? 
<chandler> i haven't... i haven't even thought about the results yet... i just assumed that everything was gonna be ok. 
<s> oh! well, you know what? it probably is. 
<chandler>  yeah, but what if it's not? what if there is a reason why we can't have a baby? 
<s> oh, chandler, look. you and monica are meant to have children. i am sure it's gonna be just fine. 
<chandler>  oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. i can't believe i didn't even think of that. i guess i was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'... 
<s> what, you can do it in the parking lot of a taco bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office? 
<chandler>  it was a "wendy's!! " 
< 
<phoebe>  "ipan stripan, glupi glabi! " and that is the swedish national anthem! thank you for asking!  
<rachel> wow, ikea... what a rich culture. uhm, you know what? i have a friend who is a masseuse. 
<phoebe> oh, ja! ja! 
<rachel> yah! she's... uhm... not very good though...  
<phoebe> uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is? 
<rachel> i don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar... 
<phoebe> or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass! 
<rachel>  phoebe!! 
<phoebe> you know it's me? 
<rachel> for like a half an hour! man, you can lie about sweden! 
<phoebe> how can you come here? 
<rachel> how could you not tell me you worked here? 
<phoebe> i don't have to tell you everything! 
<rachel> yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage! 
<phoebe> tips not included. 
<rachel> oh! phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here? 
<phoebe> because i was ashamed ok? i sold out for the cash! and then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401k. but you know... you pay a price. now i'm this corporate stooge and punching a clock and ugh! paying taxes! 
<rachel> phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! be true to what you believe in! honey, you have principles and i so admire that! i don't have any! 
<phoebe> you know what? you are right. i am gonna quit. it's time i took my life back! 
<rachel> good for you pheebs! 
<phoebe> ok. 
<phoebe> okay  if you guys have microphones in there too, i didn't mean any of that. i love you. 
< 
<ross> haha! got ya! die, die, die!  
<ross>  respectfully, professor r. geller.  hey! 
<s> hi! 
<ross> hey, how was the met? 
<s> the museum was amazing! 
<ross> yeah? joey really knows his art, huh? 
<s> not so much, no. he had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense. 
<ross> what do you mean? 
<s> well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around. 
<ross>  wait a minute... when you guys walked into the met, did you go to the right? 
<s> no, we went to the left. 
<ross>  oh joey, joey! but still, i mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together. 
<s> yeah, it's fun . 
<ross> what? 
<s> actually, you know, joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird. 
<ross> what, i mean, a little, but no, what, go on. 
<s> well... i'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe i should be with someone... i have more in common with. you know what i mean? 
<ross>  yeah. but you know what? i think you should give joey a chance. i mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else. 
<s> yeah, i guess that's true. 
<ross> and if you think about it, i mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. you know, that's the kind of guy joey is. 
<s> he is very sweet. plus he's hot! 
<ross> that was going to be my next argument.  
<joey> hey! 
<ross> hey! 
<s> hey! 
<joey>  you're ready? 
<s> yeah, let's go.  thanks ross. 
<joey>  hey ross! that art stuff worked, you hooked me up. 
<ross> glad i could help man. 
<joey> although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but...  i made it work. 
< 
<chandler>  it is not okay that i'm aroused by this now.  
<chandler> hello? oh hi, doctor connelly.  no, she's not here but, you know, i can tell her. should i be sitting down for this?  oh.  well, so what does that mean?  ok. ok, thank you. thanks.   
<monica> hey sweetie. 
<chandler> doctor connelly just called. 
<monica> with good news?  of course it is not good news, you just said  "doctor connelly just called". if it was good news you would have said  "doctor connelly just called! " but so what is it? is there a problem, uh? is there a problem with me or with you? 
<chandler> actually it's both of us. 
<monica> what? 
<chandler> apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment. 
<monica> oh... what does that mean? 
<chandler> it means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.  it means... 
<monica> chandler? 
<chandler>  it means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us. 
<monica>  oh my god! 
<chandler> i'm sorry. 
<monica> i'm sorry too.  
<chandler> well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out. 
<monica>  i know. closing credits 
< 
<s> good morning phoebe. 
<phoebe>  good morning receptionist.

<s>  oh! that feels sooo good! 
<rachel>  oh, lucky me! coffee and a live sex show! 
<s> i'm sorry, what? 
<rachel> oh... oh, i'm sorry! i'm not... i was just-i was just reading to emma. 
<s> from... cosmo?? 
<rachel> yeah, yeah... it's... "climax your way to better skin". 
<s>  so, i have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, i'm soo bad at picking out clothes! 
<joey> so you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good. 
<rachel>  not me, not me, not me, not me, not me! 
<joey> oh hey rach! 
<rachel> yeah... 
<joey> maybe you could take charlie shopping. 
<rachel> oh, well... 
<s> i'm sure you have better things to do. 
<joey> are you kidding? rachel loves to shop! and she has great taste! yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes. 
<s> if you have the time, i'd really appreciate the help. 
<rachel> ok, uh-uh... let's-let's shop!! 
<joey>  ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... ... and some slutty lingerie, slutty! 
<phoebe>  ok, great! all right, bye!  pain in the ass!!  that's off, right? 
<joey> what's the matter, pheebs? 
<phoebe> oh... mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. and she was like "oh, don't worry! i asked him. he's totally ok with seeing you!". so now i have to go so he'll think that i'm totally ok with seeing him! 
<rachel> which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him! 
<phoebe> exactly! 
<rachel> and you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous! 
<phoebe>  i didn't even think about that!  aaargh, sexual politics!! 
<rachel> hey pheebs, i'm-i'm taking charlie shopping, why don't you come and i'll help you find something. 
<phoebe> ok, that'll be great! 
<joey> oh, ain't that nice? the three of you trying on slutty lingerie together. 
<rachel> that's not what we're gonna do! 
<joey> why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'? 
<chandler>  wow! fortunately she has a very pretty face! 
<monica> oh, i so can't believe this! my uterus is an inhospitable environment? i was trying so hard to be a good hostess! 
<chandler> oh, i can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when i was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!! 
<chandler> hi. 
<monica> hi. 
<monica> ok. 
<chandler> oh, damn it!  
<monica> don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out. 
<monica>  ok. 
<chandler> is that a hint? because we love you doctor connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child!  wow, talking about an inhospitable environment! 
< 
<rachel> hi! ok, you're ready to go pick up phoebe and go shopping? 
<s> oh, yeah! let's do it! 
<joey>  alright, have a good time.  
<rachel> not gonna find any clothes in there! 
<ross>  hey, you guys! 
<rachel> hi. 
<ross> guess who's up for keynote speaker at the national paleontology conference? 
<s> umh... kurts baley? 
<ross> yeah, right! what was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract  well, why are you laughing? 
<joey> just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah! 
<s> so you're up for keynote speaker! who's making the decisions? 
<ross> professor sherman, yeah. i've a meeting with him today. 
<s> he's a pretty tough guy to impress. 
<ross> yeah, well... i think i know how to dazzle him. 
<rachel> oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya? 
<ross> tsz... no! . 
<chandler>  hey guys! 
<ross> wait a minute, you guys. oh, i wanna ask you something. i-i i may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if i do, i'd love for you guys to come and hear me. 
<chandler> i think i can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick. 
<ross> it's in barbados. 
<chandler> but you come first! 
<rachel> i'm there! 
<s> we'll see you, guys!  
<joey> bye. 
<rachel> bye, see ya.  
<chandler>  ok. 
<joey> all right, so. how did it go at the fertility clinic? 
<chandler> not as much fun as last time. apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample. 
<ross> so-so what did the doctor say? 
<chandler> well... there's surrogacy, but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her. 
<joey> so you're ruling out surrogacy? 
<chandler> yeah. 
<joey> so, i don't have to learn what that means? 
<chandler> aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors. 
<joey> enough said, i'm there for you man. where is she, upstairs? 
<chandler>  ah-ha! 
<ross> how do you feel about all this? 
<chandler> i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but i don't think there is one. 
<joey> come on ross, be a good guy. step up and do it! 
<ross>  what?  
<ross>  what? no! i am not going to give them ben! 
< 
<ross> the data we are receiving from mri scans and dna testing of these fossils are - are staggering. 
<ross>  i mean, we've been accepting leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash.  so-so what i am saying is - is is that  is that the repercussions could be huge! i mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, i mean, truly the mind boggles!  
<ross> oh, that's not what you want... 
< 
<phoebe> oh, i'll take some of that. 
<rachel> pheebs, that's for men! 
<phoebe> no, i know, this way when i go to the party later mike will know i am over him cause i'm gonna smell like another guy.  yeah.  
<phoebe> ok. oh good, i'm dating a russian cab driver. . seriously does anyone buy this? i smell like beets! 
<s>  so, you know what, i really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them. where do you think those would be? 
<rachel> on melanie griffith in "working girl". i think what you want is over here. 
<s> see, i told you i needed someone! oh, you know, by the way, as a "thank you", i would really love to take you out. 
<rachel> really? 
<s> yeah! actually joey and i are going to the movies tonight, wanna come? 
<rachel> oh, i can't. because i-i've seen them. 
<s> you've seen all the movies... 
<rachel> yeah! i'm a big fan! of the movies, you know. motion pictures. the talkies! 
<phoebe>  hey rach, will you come with me to a dressing room? 
<rachel> sure! 
<phoebe> ok! 
<s> wha, you know, maybe we can do something else! 
<rachel> you know that depends on what it is! i've done a lot of stuff.  
<phoebe> so what were you doing out there, do you not like charlie? 
<rachel> she's ok, i just don't get a really good vibe from her! 
<phoebe> why? 
<rachel> i don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! you know, and just swept joey off his feet... i mean, nobody else has a chance! 
<phoebe> who else? 
<rachel> anybody! you, me, you know, monica's mom... 
<phoebe> you like joey? 
<rachel> shhhhh! phoebe! all right, look. i have a little thing for him. 
<phoebe>  oh my god! 
<rachel> it's just physical and i have it totally under control! ok? it's just, when i see them together, sometimes i just get a little jealous! 
<phoebe> uh, wow! isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him? 
<rachel>  oh, i get it! 
<phoebe> oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right. 
<rachel> i know, i know, so it is just not a big deal. 
<phoebe> yeah. 
<rachel> so can we keep this between us? 
<phoebe> sure! 
<rachel> ok, great, because i gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me! 
<phoebe> oh.  
<phoebe> any chance charlie has a deaf twin? 
< 
<monica> hi honey! 
<chandler> hey! look i brought a friend for dinner, this is zack, from work! 
<monica> oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, zack! 
<s>  you too. 
<chandler> you guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! you're both polite!  go to have a seat zack, and i'll get you a beer. 
<monica> i got it. 
<s> thanks. 
<chandler>  so, zack's pretty nice, uh? 
<monica> yeah, i guess. 
<chandler> so, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his! 
<monica>  excuse me? 
<chandler> well, we're talking about sperm donors and zack may be the guy! i mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, i mean, he is "spermtastic"! 
<monica> chandler, this is crazy! what did you even say to him! "come up, meet my wife! give us your sperm"! 
<chandler> no, i invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! i mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out. 
<monica> chandler! 
<chandler> i'm telling you, he's great! i mean, even if my sperm worked fine, i'd think he'd be the way to go! 
<monica> i'm not going to be a part of this! you can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor! 
<chandler> ok! 
<monica> uh! 
<chandler>  zack! 
<s> thanks! do you have a coaster? i don't wanna make a ring.  
<monica> tell me about yourself, zack! 
< 
<rachel> oh, god, do you think she heard? it would be so bad if she heard! 
<phoebe> well, maybe she didn't hear! ok i'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and i'll talk and see if you can hear me. 
<rachel> ok, great!  
<rachel> oh, thank god i can't hear a word that you're saying! 
<phoebe>  i didn't say anything yet! 
<rachel>  well, get back in there and talk! 
<phoebe>  i'm rachel. it's so annoying when i put emma on the phone to talk with my friends. 
<rachel>  what!? 
<phoebe>  well, some things are just hard to say to your face. 
<rachel> ok well, i heard that! which means that she heard it too! 
<phoebe> ooh! we have a problem. 
<rachel> oh! what are we gonna do?  
<s> just be honest with her. 
<rachel> oh my god! 
<s> and it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone... 
<rachel>  alright! enough out of you! 
< 
<joey> hello? 
<ross> joey! hey, i need to talk to charlie. is she there? 
<joey> no. no... eh... she went shopping with rachel. why? what's up? 
<ross> i'm meeting with professor sherman about my being the keynote speaker...

<ross> barbados. 
<joey> fine, i'll rent a car and drive...! ross, you have to get that job! 
<ross> what am i supposed to do? he's out cold! in fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named fran to spank him harder. 
<joey> well, just wake him up! 
<ross> i can't! if he realizes that i'm the one that put him to sleep, i won't get the job! 
<joey> uh! that's a tough one. oh! wait a minute, this happened to me before! yeah, i was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and...  no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... yeah i mean hey, shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!? 
< 
<monica> hey guys! dinner's ready! 
<s> oh! i'm gonna go wash up first.  thanks! 
<chandler> so what do you think? i want that guys genes for my kid! those eyes, those cheeckbones! 
<monica> ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!! 
<chandler> you don't like him. 
<monica> i think he is fine! it's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information. 
<chandler> alright! just follow my lead!  
<s> you guys have such a great place here. 
<chandler> oh! thanks, i'm crazy about our place. hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family? 
<s> uhm... no. although i did have an uncle who voted for dukakis. 
<chandler>  that's really not the kind of thing we are looking for zack. 
<s>  okaaay... so eh... so tell me, how did you guys meet. 
<monica> oh, friends first, drunk in london, you know the story. i've got a better question for you 
<s>  no... 
<monica> eh... heart disease, alzheimers, gout? 
<s> you guys don't have people for dinner a lot, huh? 
<monica> we're just making conversation.  
<s> ok. i heard a joke today. it's pretty funny... 
<chandler> you know what's not funny? male pattern baldness  
<s> ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and i'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. can we just talk about something else? 
<s> ravioli's delicious! 
<chandler> i noticed you were enjoying that ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. did you have braces as a child? 
<s> no i didn't. 
<monica> yess!!  
<chandler>  we're teeth people zack! 
< 
<rachel> alright! let's just do it. let's just go over there and see if she heard. 
<phoebe> good plan. 
<rachel> ok.  wha...? where? where are you going? 
<phoebe> oh! i'm sorry rachel, i don't have time for your childish games, ok? i still have to go find something incredible to wear so i can beat mike at "who's more over who"!  
<rachel>  hey, hi! hey, where've you been? 
<s> oh! trying on clothes. 
<rachel>  oh! wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? well, that's so weird! phoebe and i were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. god it's just such a small world! 
<s>  rachel... i heard you guys whispering. 
<rachel> oh god. you did. you heard. ok, listen, let me explain. 
<s> no! there's nothing to explain. i heard you. phoebe likes joey. 
<rachel>  yeah. 
<s> it's just that... i don't understand it... i mean, phoebe likes joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...? 
<rachel> yeah! that's phoebe. that's phoebe. you know, she just wants them all! it's like she's a nympho! 
<s> wow! 
<rachel> yeah... 
<s> you know, by the way. i heard you tell her not to do anything. thanks for sticking up for me. you are such a nice person. 
<rachel>  i try... 
<  
<ross>  oh my god! you really want me to be the keynote speaker? thank you!  
<  
<joey>  wow! you look... ... stop-eating hot! which is like the highest level of hotness! 
<phoebe> are you sure? because i'm really dreading going to this party. 
<joey> then don't go! 
<phoebe> mike knows i'm coming, and if i don't show up he'll think it's because of him! and i don't want to lose face! that's a very serious thing in my culture. 
<joey> alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over mike. and afterward you come to my place and i'll get you good and drunk! 
<phoebe> you got it! ok. but not on the wine that you made, ok, because i just don't want to go back to the emergency room.  
< 
<phoebe> david?  
<s> phoebe! hi! 
<phoebe> oh my god!  
<s> wow, you look unbelievable. 
<phoebe> yeah. what-what are you doing here? 
<s> well, i'm back from minsk... permanently. 
<phoebe> what happened? 
<s> well, remember how i was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles? 
<phoebe> yeah? 
<s> well, after eight years of research i discovered that it can't be done. 
<phoebe> well, it's great that you're back! how are you? 
<s> good, good, life is good... 
<phoebe> good! 
<s> ah well, i-i'm seeing someone. 
<phoebe>  oh, good for you. 
<s> she's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, i mean, i saw what you had with that mike guy, and i just said "boy, i want that". 
<phoebe> mike and i broke up. 
<s> you're kidding me. because i'm not seeing anybody, i've just totally made that up. 
<phoebe> really? 
<s> yeah, i don't know why, i'm sorry, i guess i just didn't want to lose face. 
<phoebe> i understand. yeah. ok so then ok, so we're both living in new york, not seeing anyone. that's so not like us! 
<s> yeah, i know. well... this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that, but do you have some place that you need to be right now? 
<phoebe> well...  no. 
<s> do you wanna get a drink? 
<phoebe> i'd love to. 
<s> great. 
<phoebe> ok.  
<s> do you smell beets? 
<phoebe> oh, got it, stay upwind of me.  
<s> hey, there's phoebe! is that mike she's with? 
<rachel> no, that's david. 
<s> there's a third guy? 
<rachel>  tip of the iceberg.  
<s> i'm gonna take off now. you're gonna let me go home, aren't you? 
<chandler> you sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer? 
<s> no, no, i should get home, i'm kinda tired. 
<chandler> are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression. 
<s> no it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. i'll see you tomorrow. 
<chandler> ok.  
<chandler> i think we've found our sperm! 
<monica> does seem pretty perfect. 
<chandler> yeah, you think so, well? should i ask him? 
<monica>  no. 
<chandler> why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway! 
<monica> no, that's not it. it's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, i just... i just realized i don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you. 
<chandler> yeah, he's better! 
<monica> no, he's not. and if i can't get pregnant with you, then i don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else. 
<chandler> really? are you sure? 
<monica> yeah, i'm sure. 
<chandler>  thank god, because i don't wanna do this either. you know, i was just doing because i thought that was what you wanted to do. you know, i'm the husband, i'm supposed to... bring the sperm. 
<monica> that is so sweet. i love you.  
<chandler> so you know this leaves us with... 
<monica> adoption. 
<chandler> how do you feel about that? 
<monica> i think i feel ok about it. actually i think i feel really good about it. 
<chandler> me too. i wanna find a baby that needs a home and i wanna raise it with you. and i wanna mess it up in our own specific way. 
<monica> so this is it, we're really gonna adopt? 
<chandler>  yeah. 
<monica>  oh my god, we're gonna be parents! 
<chandler> we are gonna be great parents. 
<monica> and it could be soon. i mean, think about it 
<chandler> wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!  
<chandler> hey, zack! 
<s>  hey chandler. 
<chandler> look, i just wanted to apologize for last night. i got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable. 
<s> no you didn't. 
<chandler> really? 
<s> no you did. 
<chandler> my wife and i have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. we're working on it.  
<s>  here are the boards for friday's pitch . 
<s> oh, thank you.  
<chandler> you wouldn't know if jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya? friends - 923-924 - the one in barbados 
< 
<joey>  hey! i'm all packed and ready to go! 
<ross> oh, that's right!  daddy and uncle joey are going on a trip today. we're going to a conference in barbados, right? 
<joey> mmh-mmh. 
<ross>  can you say barbados? 
<joey> barbados! 
<ross> ok, i gotta say. i mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! uh! and i've a surprise, uh... i had to pull some strings but i was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! that's right!  this babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars. 
<rachel> do you have anything that would... get us out of them? 
<chandler> yeah ross, i mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, "island's stuff". 
<phoebe> i think david would probably wanna hear a few lectures. 
<ross> oh, right, because he's a scientist! 
<phoebe> no, no, because, you know, he's been in minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die. 
<ross> ok, we gotta go, yeah? so, we'll see you guys tomorrow. 
<joey> all right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally. 
<ross> it's a blanket joe, not a cloak of invisibility! 
<s> wow! this place is beautiful! 
<ross>  look at all these paleontologists!! 
<joey> i know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow!  
<s> oh my god, i can't believe you're here! 
<joey>  i think i've been recognized, this happens all the time! 
<s> doctor geller, i'm such a huge fan! 
<joey> that... never happens... 
<s> i've been following your career for years, i-i can't wait for your keynote speech. 
<ross> wow! this is very flattering, uh... 
<s> i would love your autograph.  
<ross> uh, uh... sure! uhm... "dear..."  
<s> sarah. 
<ross> "... sarah. i dig you", uh? "doctor ross geller". 
<s> thank you so much! 
<ross> yeah, oh and sarah... i'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, professor wheeler, a-and this is joey tribbiani. 
<s>  are you a paleontologist? 
<joey> no, god, no! no! no no, i'm an actor. you'd probably recognize me from a little show called "the days of our lives". 
<ross> dude, it's just "days of our lives"... there's no the. 
<joey>  ok, ross! it's... it's fun, yeah! no, i-i play doctor drake ramoray. 
<s> i'm sorry, i don't own a tv. 
<joey> you don't own a tv? what's all your furniture pointed at?? 
< 
<monica> david, can you help me?! i'm trying to explain to chandler how a plane stays in the air. 
<s> oh, certainly. that's a combination of bernoulli's principle and newton's third law of motion. 
<monica>  see? 
<chandler> yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind". 
<monica> alright, i'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip. 
<phoebe> oh, i should go, too. oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should mike and i just meet you there.  
<phoebe> mike?? who's mike? 
<s> mike is your ex... uh... boyfriend! 
<phoebe> that's right! oh, yeah... well, i've totally forgotten about im! ah! that's-that's... a blast from the past! 
<s> it's ok. ho-honest mistake. 
<phoebe> really, it doesn't mean anything. i mean, you know, monica refers to chandler as richard all the time! 
<chandler>  she does? 
<monica>  let's get you out of here!!   
<monica> at least you took me down with you! 
<phoebe> i'm sooo sorry!! i just... i keep thinking about mike! i'm crazy about david, and we're having so much fun together. why-why do i miss mike? that's-that's gonna go away, right? 
<monica> i guess, in time. 
<phoebe> yeah. 
<monica> i mean, my feelings for richard are certainly gone. 
<phoebe> you just did it again. chandler, your feelings for chandler are certainly gone! 
< 
<s>  well, phoebe's still pretty hung up on that mike, uh? 
<chandler> i wouldn't read too much into it. 
<s> still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right? 
<chandler> david, let me stop you there 'cause i think i see where this is going. i'm not very good at giving advice. so if you want advice, go to ross, monica, or... joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee. 
<s> sorry, i just... i wish there was something i could do, you know? well, you know phoebe... 
<chandler> seriously, we're gonna do this? 
<s> i'm sorry, uh... i just wish i could make her forget about mike already, you know... why did phoebe and mike break up? 
<chandler> oh, because his penis was too big.  oh, i'm sorry, that's the kind of thing i do.  they broke up because mike didn't want to get married. hey, what if you just let phoebe know you'd be open to marriage? 
<s> that's great! that's great! i-i'll propose to her! 
<chandler> what? 
<s> well, i was probably going to do it at some point. 
<chandler> i didn't mean now... 
<s> why not? it's brilliant!  goodbye mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella!  well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding...  thank you, chandler. sincerely. 
<chandler> well, you're welcome! glad i could help. 
<s>  how do you think i should propose? 
<chandler> david, i'm pretending to read here!! 
<  
<joey> yeah! how you doin'? yeah alright!  
<joey> hey, hey! you said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong? 
<s>  i didn't mean a thong... i meant thongs... 
<joey> you really should have been more clear about that!  
<ross> hey! 
<joey> hey! 
<ross>  you're never going to guess who i just saw downstairs! 
<joey> oh! ah! eh... britney spears!? 
<ross> yeah, she never misses these conferences!  no, i just saw dr. kenneth schwartz! 
<s> oh my god! did you talk to him? 
<ross> yeah... what am i going to say to kenneth schwartz? 
<joey> you could say 
<ross>  ready to go? 
<s> yeah! 
<joey> wha...? you're gonna go now? i thought we could hang out? 
<s> oh i can't... i have seminars all day and i promised ross i would look at his speech. 
<ross> yeah. 
<s> but maybe we can have dinner later? on the balcony? will be romantic. 
<joey>  will you wear a thong? 
<s> i will if you will. 
<joey> oh... you got yourself a very weird deal! 
<ross>  i'm good, i have dinner plans . 
<s> so you'll be ok? 
<joey> yeah, yeah. i've got tons of stuff i could do. i'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming... 
<ross> uh, joe, have you looked outside? 
<joey> no, why?  
<joey> oh man! 
<s> there's an indoor pool, you can swim there!  
<joey> i wasn't gonna swim, i was gonna dig a hole!  
< 
<monica> wow! that mike thing was interesting! i don't know what's gonna happen with phoebe and david. 
<chandler>  i do! want a hint? huh? "i do"  "i do". 
<monica> ok, i'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee. 
<chandler> david is going to propose to phoebe. 
<monica> what?  why? 
<chandler> be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married. 
<monica> chandler, we have talked about this. you are not supposed to give people advice! now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke? 
<chandler> i did! a penis one! look, just so i know, what was so wrong about what i said? 
<monica> they've only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike! she'll say "no", david's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again. 
<chandler> man, that's some bad advice! 
<  
<joey> oh! hey! thank god you guys are here! 
<rachel> hey! hey what's going on? 
<joey> everything is upside down here! it rains all day long, nobody watches tv and ross is famous!  
<rachel> alright, i don't wanna alarm anybody, but monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!  
<monica> ok! when i go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?! 
<chandler> that's why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross! 
<joey> come on, i'll show you guys where to check in  
<monica>  oh, honey, can you make sure we get a king size bed! 
<phoebe>  oh! david, get one for us too! oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! and with mirrors on the ceiling! 
<monica>  and make sure our room isn't next to theirs . 
<rachel> ooh! you guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. that's all, i just wish i could  share that with a guy. 
<phoebe> not joey. 
<rachel> not joey, no, i was just lusting after chandler. 
<monica> yeah, right!  
<s> so, ehm... i'm proposing to pheobe tonight.  
<chandler> tonight?!  isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond?  oh, there it is! 
<s> yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. that's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. and the clarity is uhm... is quite poor. 
<chandler>  nice!  
<chandler> monica, can i talk to you for a sec?  
<monica> ok! 
<chandler> david is going to propose to phoebe tonight! 
<monica> see what happens when you give people advice? i hope you told him not to? 
<chandler> that would be advice!! 
<monica> ok fine. i'll handle this.  phoebe? 
<phoebe> yeah? 
<monica>  i need to talk to you. 
<phoebe> are you leaving "the supremes"?  
<monica> ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. look, david is going to propose to you tonight. 
<phoebe> wow? really? that's fantastic! 
<monica> what are you serious? you wanna marry him? wha... what about mike? 
<phoebe> oh, ok, you want me to marry mike? alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. i can just see it 
<monica> do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer? 
<phoebe> sure! look, ok, bottom line 
< 
<ross> by using ct scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century. 
<s> it's great. you're gonna be the hit of the conference. 
<ross> oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because i won't be constantly interrupted by joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. . 
<joey> hey guys! 
<ross> the chocolates aren't here yet. 
<joey> damnit! 
<s> ross just read me his speech. it's fantastic! 
<chandler> oh, is it on the computer, cuz i'd love to give it a read...? 
<ross> if you want to check your email, just ask!  
<chandler>  what?  may i? 
<rachel>  what's with the rain, geller? i mean, when i signed up for dino week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season. 
<s> actually the wet season is june to december. 
<rachel> it's not the time charlie. 
<chandler>  oh, no, no, no dear god, no! 
<joey> oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot?  oh! secret teapot? 
<chandler> your computer, i don't know wha... everything's gone! 
<ross> wha... what do you mean?  
<chandler> it must be a virus. i think it erased your hard drive. 
<ross> what, oh my god. what did you do? 
<chandler> someone i don't know sent me an e-mail and i opened it. 
<ross> why, why would you open it? 
<chandler> well, it didn't say "this is a virus"!! 
<ross> what did it say? 
<chandler> nude... ... pictures of anna kournikova. i'm so sorry. 
<ross> what... what am i gonna do? my speech is gone, chandler! 
<chandler> it's not gone! i mean, i'm sure you printed out a copy. you have a hard copy, right? 
<ross> no! i don't!! 
<chandler> well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...! 
<joey> it's really gone? 
<ross> yep! i'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career! 
<chandler> i just feel awful. 
<ross> yeah, well you should! i mean, nude pictures of anna kournikova? i mean, she's never even won a major tournament! 
<chandler> well, i tried billy jean king, but...  you know, you and monica have the same "i'm gonna kill you" look...? i can usually make it go away by kissing her...  
<ross> get out!  
<rachel> you know, this happens all the time to my computer at work. 
<ross> well, what do you do? 
<rachel> well, i usually go... play tetris on somebody else's computer. 
<ross> i can't believe this. i can't believe this is happening. i have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! ok? i have to stand up in front of all these people. what am i gonna say? 
<joey> i could teach you a speech that i memorized for auditions. 
<ross> i don't think that your monologue from star wars is gonna help me right now, joe! 
<s> ross, we can solve this. i just heard your speech. we can recreate it! we've got all night! 
<ross> wha... what you really think we can do that? 
<s> oh wait, joey and i are supposed to have dinner . 
<joey> hey don't worry about that! i mean, ross needs you! and rachel and i will stay and help anyway we can. 
<rachel> ugh. 
<ross> alright, ok, let's do it.  uhm, i know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then i move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the mesozoic era, the breakup of pangea, hello!  and then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the triassic. 
<joey> oh, oh! any chance any of this happened in a "galaxy far, far away"? . 
< 
<s> hello? 
<monica> ok, mike, enough is enough, now you love phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole "i never want to get married" thing and step up! 
<s> who is this? 
<monica> this is monica! i'm phoebe's friend. listen, phoebe is back with david and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say "yes" but i know she really wants to be with you! 
<s>  he... he's gonna propose? 
<monica> i... i'm sorry, did you say something? i can't hear through all this damned hair!  
<s> look, if phoebe wants to marry david, she should, i'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you. 
<monica> you don't tell me what to do! i tell you what to do! just call her. she's at the paradise hotel in barbados. and while i've got you, you've got curly hair. what do you do in humidity?  damnit!  
<monica>  well, i hope you're happy! 
<chandler>  oooh! i hope you're happy too, honey! 
<monica> phoebe is going to say "yes" to david. see, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives! 
<chandler> phoebe is going to say "yes"? that's, that's great! 
<monica> no it's not, b'cause she's still in love with mike! 
<chandler> and there's not chance that will work? 
<monica> no, i called him. it's not gonna happen. 
<chandler>  oooooooh! meddler! meddler! 
<monica> well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, i wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place! 
<chandler> this vacation sucks!! 
< 
<joey> i'm so bored! stupid rain, we... we can't do anything. 
<rachel> well, i've brought some books. we could read. 
<joey> hey, it hasn't come to that yet.  
<joey>  hey hey hey! don't mind if i do! 
<s> i'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention  
<joey> hey rach, do you feel like going to a convention? 
<rachel> we can't. we're not pharmacists! 
<joey>  i know we're not, but  frank medeio and...  eva trorro... womba... 
<rachel>  kate miller? 
<joey> kate miller it is.  
<rachel> and... that's the most sex i'm gonna have this weekend. 
<joey> in that case should i make sure it's on real good?  
<rachel> thank you.  
< 
<s> and then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the mesozoic era in the 21st century. 
<ross> yeah, that's it? 
<s> yeah. 
<ross> oh my god, we did it!  
<s> actually i did it ross. you remembered shockingly little of your own speech. 
<ross> yes, but i did make a pyramid out of the bath products. this is amazing, thank you, thank you so much.  that's a pretty necklace. 
<s> thank you. 
<ross> hey, what do you say we celebrate? champagne?  
<s> oh yeah! hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you. 
<ross> oh my god, i love you. 
<s> oh, this is such a cute picture of emma. and is this your son... or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation? 
<ross> that's ben, my son from my first marriage. 
<s> your first marriage? 
<ross> yeah. 
<s> you're married more than once? 
<ross> no.  
<s> so, why did you break up? 
<ross>  oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? she... she was... eh... gay. 
<s> oh my god, this is so cool! 
<ross> ok, odd thing to get excited about! 
<s> no, it's just... i was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay! 
<ross> hey! high-five!  
<s> didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? my fiancé was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner. 
<ross> my wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. she didn't get any fitter. 
<s> right and then everybody finds out and they're like 
<ross> i know! it's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? i mean, call, or leave a note 
<s> i know! 
<ross> and then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome? 
<s> i didn't do that. 
<ross>  me neither. 
< 
<joey> well, who knew? pharmacists are fun. 
<rachel> i know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home. 
<joey> not enough pills in the world, rach. what about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like? 
<rachel> well, let's see. there was a really big guy that i was talking to, with the really nice breasts... 
<joey> but what about back home, anything going on there? anybody you like? 
<rachel>  no. 
<joey> there it is, you're blushing! 
<rachel> no, i'm not blushing, i'm sunburnt! from, you know, the rain. 
<joey> you like someone. tell me who it is. who is it?  
<rachel> no. 
<joey> tell me who it is. 
<rachel> joey!  
<joey> come on who? who do you like? tell me. you're not getting away that easy. who do you like, who? 
<rachel> joey, come on! it doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen. 
<joey> what? why not? rach, who can you not get? 
<rachel> oh!  ok. ok, you really wanna know who it is? 
<joey>  yeah, who is that? 
<rachel> do ya? 
<joey> yeah.   
<s>  i just left you a message! ross and i were gonna go grab a bite, but now that you're here, maybe we can go have that dinner. 
<joey> right, of course. hey, did you guys finish the speech? 
<ross> yep, we got it, we got it.  thank you so much. 
<s> i had a great time. 
<joey> alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because i really wanna know who... 
<rachel> later! la... 
<s> so, shall we? 
<joey> yeah.  
<rachel> ok. see you, bye. 
<s> bye. 
<ross> good night. 
<joey> night.  
<  
<monica> i can't believe she's gonna say yes to david. she's clearly in love with mike. 
<chandler> you know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.  
<s> uh, phoebe, uh, i have... something i wanna say. 
<monica> oh my god, he's gonna do it now. please, i cannot watch this, let's go. 
<chandler> i think we have some time. have you ever heard him talk?  "uh, phoebe, uh, i would be honoured, uh..." spit it out, david! 
<s> uh, phoebe, uh...  you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. of course the sanitation strikes in minsk didn't help! 
<phoebe> sure, ok, yeah. 
<s> but well, now that we're together again, i don't ever want to be apart. so, to that end...  
<phoebe> oh my god, mike! 
<s> it's david, actually! 
<phoebe> no, mike's here. 
<s>  hi mike! 
<s> hi david. chandler. monica...  oh! 
<monica> it's the humidity! 
<s> hi phoebe. 
<phoebe> what are you, what are you doing here? 
<s> i have a question i need to ask you. 
<s> i have a question i was kinda gonna ask her myself. 
<s> yeah, i understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this. 
<s>  ok, would you care for my seat as well? 
<s> actually yeah, that'll be great. 
<s> that's fair, you've had a long trip.  
<s> phoebe, i love you. i mean, i missed you so much these last few months and i thought we were apart for a good reason, but then i suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you. 
<s> kinda stepped on the toes of what i was going to say. 
<s> sorry david, but she really has to know this. 
<s> alright, but after this i want to see you outside. if the rain stops. 
<monica> you're the most incredible woman i've ever met. how can i lose you?  now, i don't actually have a ring... 
<s> i have a ring. 
<chandler> i wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy. 
<s> phoebe, will you marry me? 
<phoebe>  no! 
<s> uhm... ha ha! 
<phoebe> i love you. but i never needed a proposal from you. i just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future. 
<s> we can have any future you want.  
<s> ok, i'm gonna take off. 
<phoebe> david, i'm so sorry, i'm sorry. 
<s> just so i know, if i had asked first... 
<phoebe> yeah, i might have said yes, but that would have been wrong. 
<s> please, you don't have to explain. i mean, perhaps if i hadn't gone to minsk things would have worked out for us. and i wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. it was a good trip!  
<s> is it ok if i hug you now? 
<phoebe> yes!  
<monica>  because of our meddling! alright? 
< 
<chandler> oh, ain't this nice? it's so quiet, i could just lie here all day. 
<monica> i know   
<rachel>  open your drapes! open your drapes! 
<chandler> i'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!  
<monica> the sun is out! 
<chandler> hey! remember when i had corneas? 
<monica> ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and i'll get the magazines and the lotion. 
<chandler> ladies? ross's speech is in 45 minutes. 
<rachel> nooo! 
<monica> damn it! 
<ross>  walls are pretty thin, guys! 
< 
<ross> then we have to await the data from recent mri scans and dna testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating. 
<rachel> look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, i'm so jealous! 
<ross> finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered 
<chandler>  not to mention the cold sores.  
<ross> and that's just the herbivores. i'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.  
<chandler>  really? 
<ross> but all kidding aside, in much the same way that homo ergaster  is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus...  
<s> what? 
<joey> he said "erectus"! 
<s> you're... you're kidding, right? 
<joey> no, he really said it. 
<ross> ... and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus...  
<joey> erectus? 
<rachel> homo. 
< 
<ross> ... in a very real way we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century.  thank you!  
<ross> oh, thanks guys! 
<ross> oh! 
<ross>  ok... now... now we're just holding hands!  
<rachel> all right! well, uh...  we're gonna hit the beach? 
<monica> yeah! 
<rachel>  it was really... great! 
<ross> oh, thank you so much! 
<joey> yeah, and so funny! 
<rachel> oh!  
<ross>  ok!... all right, thanks! thank you so much, you guys!  oh, i can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here! 
<s>  you're kidding, we wouldn't have missed it!  
<s> oh... i'm back! 
<ross>  ok!... uh... excuse me? yeah?  
<ross> hey!  well...?  
<s> you were incredible! 
<ross> yeah? 
<s> you blew them away! 
<ross> oh, i can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! i mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me? 
<s>  i was not! 
<ross> no, it's ok! made me feel like a rock star! 
<s> oh my god!  i'm your groupie! 
<ross>  i'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!  
<ross>  look, i took it too far! 
< 
<monica>  i can't believe it's raining again! oh, it's so unfair!!!  
<phoebe> well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off.  not you guys. you got it going on!  
<monica> so, what are we gonna do today? 
<s> they have a game room downstairs! ping pong and stuff. 
<monica>  ping pong?  honey, they have ping pong! let's play! 
<chandler> i don't think so! 
<monica>  why not? 
<chandler> because you know how competitive you get and well, i say it's cute, others disagree, and i'm lying! 
<monica> i'm not always that bad! 
<chandler> oh, yeah? what happened when we played last time? 
<monica>  i punched you...? 
<chandler> and...? 
<monica> ... phoebe...? 
<phoebe> ... and...? 
<monica> i clunked your heads together!  
<  
<s>  hey! there you are! 
<joey> hey!  as soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya!  
<s> i'm sorry, i can't! i'm running a discussion group all afternoon. 
<joey>  oh... oh, but that's ok, i'll find someone else to do it... i'll do it alone, but... i don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you... 
<s> you know... i feel so bad! i haven't seen you this whole trip and  especially last night... 
<joey>  hey! don't worry about it! it was fine! i ended up having the best time with rachel! i just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on ross's speech...  
<s> actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun! 
<joey>  oh! oh, well! at least we're both having fun! 
<s> yeah...  
<s> ... is it weird that it's not with each other? 
<joey> yeah! a little bit, yeah... 
<s>  i think we need to talk...!  
<joey> yeah... i think we do... ... about what? 
< 
<monica> c'mon guys, it'll be fun! 
<phoebe> all right, all right... i'll play if we don't keep score! 
<monica> but then how do we know who wins? 
<phoebe> nobody wins! 
<monica> so, we're just four losers... super! 
<chandler> i'm not playing with you. 
<phoebe> yeah, i'm out. 
<s> i'll play ya! 
<monica>  ok! 
<phoebe> mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing! 
<chandler> she gets crazy! this scar  is from pictionary!  
<s>  i think i will be all right!  you wanna volley a bit for a serve? 
<monica> sure! got to!  
<monica> aww! 
<s> oh, by the way... i'm awesome!! 
<chandler>  oh dear god, there's two of them! 
<s> you're ready to play? 
<monica> hell, yeah! 
<chandler>  did you know this about him? 
<phoebe> no idea! i though he was soft like you! 
<s> wanna make it more interesting? 
<monica> how much were you thinking? 
<s> ten bucks a game? 
<monica> make it fifty! 
<s> i'll make it a hundred! 
<monica>  one thousand... 
<chandler>  ok! 
<s> to see who goes first, you got a quarter? 
<monica>  no...  either of you girls got a quarter? 
<chandler> honey, try to focus the trash talk on him! 
<phoebe>  monica, you call it. 
<monica> heads! no, tails! he-he-heads! 
<phoebe> tails! 
<monica>  ow, what are the chances!  
<monica> ha! my point! 
<s> oh, no! i don't think so! you know, according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point. 
<phoebe>  he was a lawyer! 
< 
<rachel> oh! weather bitch!   
<rachel> it's open!  hi, joe! 
<joey>  hey... 
<rachel>  what, is everything ok? 
<joey> uh... charlie and i broke up. 
<rachel> nooooo, why? 
<joey> oh well, she said we have nothing in common. 
<rachel>  oh, that's crazy! 
<joey> no, it's not, we have nothing in common! 
<rachel> ... yeah, it's true. 
<joey> i mean, she should be with someone like... ross! you know what i mean, he uses all those big words too! man, smart people are dull! 
<rachel>  what, hey! 
<joey>  ok, rach!  
<joey> i feel so stupid, you know? why... why do i keep going after the wrong girls? 
<rachel> w-what are you, what are you talking about? 
<joey> oh, c'mon, i mean, there's you, then there's charlie, and it's like...  what the hell is my problem? oh!  
<rachel> ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl... 
<joey>  i'm telling you, rach, charlie is not right for me! 
<rachel> yeah, i'm not talking about her... 
<joey> but then who? the_waitress i went out with last month?  
<rachel> you know? forget it! 
<joey>  no-no-no-no, no! who, who were you talking about? 
<rachel> no, i-i-i-i don't, i actually don't know who i'm talking about! so! 
<joey> ok! all right, well... i'm gonna see if i can get a room for the night and i'll... i'll see you later! 
<rachel> yeah, sure!  
< 
<joey> you like me?  
<rachel>  ok, let's not make a big thing about this! 
<joey>  that's a huge thing! 
<rachel> not working with me, joe! here's the thing 
<joey> what... for how long? 
<rachel> only like a month! 
<joey>  a month?? 
<rachel> what the... dial it down!  listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes i do, i have, i've been thinking about... you know, us!  ok, dial it up a little! 
<joey>  i just have one question! 
<rachel> shoot! 
<joey>  what the hell are you doin'??? 
<rachel> i don't know, i'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... i mean, aren't you just a... little curious...  what that would be like?... 
<joey> uh, am i curious? i mean, i am as curious as... as... george!! 
<rachel>  who...? 
<joey> curious george ! you know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat! 
<rachel> oh yes, of course, i remember him! 
<joey> yeah, he had a paper route. 
<rachel> yeah, he did!  oh, see, this is what i'm talking about! 
<joey> no, i know, yeah i know we're great but rach no... this... this can't happen! 
<rachel> but can it... just... happen a little bit? 
<joey>  no, no! it can't happen at all! 
<rachel> but why, why not? 
<joey> because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok?  i have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did i ever say no!  i couldn't do it to ross! 
<rachel> but that wasn't gonna stop you before! 
<joey> i know, i know! but i've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right...  i'm sorry...! 
<rachel>  i'm sorry, too!  oh god! i shouldn't have said anything! 
<joey> no! no-no-no-no-no-no! hey! hey, we'll be fine! li... hey, like you said 
<rachel> it's not a big deal! 
<joey> no big deal! 
<rachel> it's so not a big deal! 
<joey> yeah! i'll see ya later! yeah! 
<rachel> ok!  
<rachel> ok, i...  
<rachel> aaahhhh!  
< 
<monica> ooh! i'm sorry! i think, i think, that may have missed the table! 
<s> do you? 
<monica> ah, yeah! 
<s> do you? 
<monica> ah, yeaaah! 
<s> do you? 
<monica> ah yeaaaah! 
<chandler>  do you really find this attractive on him? 
<phoebe>  oh, yeah!  are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by monica, right now?  
<chandler> i think this is the first time in our marriage that i've felt like the more attractive one. 
<phoebe> c'mon mike, you can beat her! knock that dog off her head!  
<monica> oh, damn it! 
<phoebe>  i sleep with him! 
<s>  game, point! 
<monica>  don't get too cocky! remember i won the last one! oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl? 
<s> you know, you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that.  
<monica> no, no, nooo! 
<s> and that's how it's done!  
<chandler> okay-dokay, you've each won a game and i've lost what's felt like a year of my life. so everybody goes home a winner. 
<monica> best out of three? 
<s> that's what i'm thinking. 
<chandler> should i use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil? 
<monica>  serve the ball, chump! 
<s> serve the ball, chump. 
<phoebe>  ok mike, better come back mike, better come back. 
< 
<s> i'm just saying, i have a cabin in the adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be  just nifty! 
<ross> ooh, well. ah, i kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that i wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man.  
<s> jarvis? 
<s>  oh, you're back...  this is my wife, nancy. 
<ross> get out!  
<s> ross, can i talk to you for a minute? 
<ross> yes, please!  so, what's going on? 
<s> uh, well... joey and i broke up. 
<ross> oh my god, wh-what happened? 
<s> joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! i mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus! 
<ross> i knew that was him! 
<s> anyway i just, uh, i think it's for the best. 
<ross>  hey, you ok? 
<s> i guess. there was hum...  there was another reason that i thought it was time to end it with joey. i started to realize that i was having feelings for someone  else.  
<s>  ok geller. last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker. 
<ross> oh, professor clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here. 
<s> yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later? 
<ross>  ok, gentlemen! please! aren't we a little old for this? i mean, we're scientists, right? we're academics. and most importantly i... you-you will have to catch us first. . go, go, go!  
<  
<s> ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41. 
<chandler>  ok, look! enough is enough! 
<monica> no, i have just to have two more points to beat him! 
<chandler> monica, that was also true an hour ago! i mean, please, look at you! your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head! 
<monica> i can't just walk away! i've put in four hours! 
<chandler> but... 
<monica> look! you knew this about me when you married me! you agreed to take me in sickness and in health. well, this is my sickness! 
<chandler> what about the obsessive cleaning? 
<monica> that's just good sense!  
<monica>  aww!  
<chandler> you ok? 
<monica> no, no, no. honey, i'm ok. shake it off!  oh, no! no shaking, no shaking! ooh! ooh!  oh my god! i can't play! 
<s> so you forfeit? 
<phoebe> mike wins? 
<monica> i can't believe it!  i lost! 
<chandler> no, you didn't. 
<monica> what? 
<chandler> because i'm gonna play for ya. 
<phoebe> you can't do that! 
<s> oh, that's ok. i don't care which of them i beat. 
<phoebe> ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister. 
<monica>  honey, you don't have to do this. 
<chandler>  yes, i do. now, i may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because i love you. 
<monica> but... you suck! 
<chandler>  you're welcome, sweetheart.  
<chandler> all right mike, let's get this over with. sudden death. whoever wins this point, wins. 
<s> ok!  
<monica> oh my god! you're good! 
<phoebe> it's like watching porn!  
<chandler> and that's... how... it's done! 
<monica>  oh my god. that was so amazing! when did you  hold on! i almost forgot  loser!  when did you stop sucking? 
<chandler> i never sucked, i actually didn't want you to know how good i was! 
<monica> why? 
<chandler> i don't know. 
<monica> this is so great! now we can enter into doubles tournaments! 
<chandler> that's why! 
< 
<s> thanks! 
<ross> hi. 
<s> are they still looking for us? 
<ross> yeah. the bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores.  you know, we as a group are not the coolest.  
<ross> i don't think they saw us. 
<s> i don't think they did.  
<s> hum, so, i started to say you something earlier, hum...  there was another reason i realized it was time to end it with joey. i kind of realized i... was starting to have feelings... for someone else. 
<ross>  oh. can i... can i ask who? 
<s> i think you know. 
<ross> i think i know too but i've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...  
<ross> i'm sorry... we... we can't. 
<s> all right, all right. 
<ross> i mean, you just went out with my best friend, and i just think it'd be a really really bad idea.  or-or not!   
<rachel> what?  friends - 923-924 - the one in barbados 
< 
<joey>  hey! i'm all packed and ready to go! 
<ross> oh, that's right!  daddy and uncle joey are going on a trip today. we're going to a conference in barbados, right? 
<joey> mmh-mmh. 
<ross>  can you say barbados? 
<joey> barbados! 
<ross> ok, i gotta say. i mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! uh! and i've a surprise, uh... i had to pull some strings but i was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! that's right!  this babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars. 
<rachel> do you have anything that would... get us out of them? 
<chandler> yeah ross, i mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, "island's stuff". 
<phoebe> i think david would probably wanna hear a few lectures. 
<ross> oh, right, because he's a scientist! 
<phoebe> no, no, because, you know, he's been in minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die. 
<ross> ok, we gotta go, yeah? so, we'll see you guys tomorrow. 
<joey> all right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally. 
<ross> it's a blanket joe, not a cloak of invisibility! 
<s> wow! this place is beautiful! 
<ross>  look at all these paleontologists!! 
<joey> i know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow!  
<s> oh my god, i can't believe you're here! 
<joey>  i think i've been recognized, this happens all the time! 
<s> doctor geller, i'm such a huge fan! 
<joey> that... never happens... 
<s> i've been following your career for years, i-i can't wait for your keynote speech. 
<ross> wow! this is very flattering, uh... 
<s> i would love your autograph.  
<ross> uh, uh... sure! uhm... "dear..."  
<s> sarah. 
<ross> "... sarah. i dig you", uh? "doctor ross geller". 
<s> thank you so much! 
<ross> yeah, oh and sarah... i'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, professor wheeler, a-and this is joey tribbiani. 
<s>  are you a paleontologist? 
<joey> no, god, no! no! no no, i'm an actor. you'd probably recognize me from a little show called "the days of our lives". 
<ross> dude, it's just "days of our lives"... there's no the. 
<joey>  ok, ross! it's... it's fun, yeah! no, i-i play doctor drake ramoray. 
<s> i'm sorry, i don't own a tv. 
<joey> you don't own a tv? what's all your furniture pointed at?? 
< 
<monica> david, can you help me?! i'm trying to explain to chandler how a plane stays in the air. 
<s> oh, certainly. that's a combination of bernoulli's principle and newton's third law of motion. 
<monica>  see? 
<chandler> yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind". 
<monica> alright, i'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip. 
<phoebe> oh, i should go, too. oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should mike and i just meet you there.  
<phoebe> mike?? who's mike? 
<s> mike is your ex... uh... boyfriend! 
<phoebe> that's right! oh, yeah... well, i've totally forgotten about im! ah! that's-that's... a blast from the past! 
<s> it's ok. ho-honest mistake. 
<phoebe> really, it doesn't mean anything. i mean, you know, monica refers to chandler as richard all the time! 
<chandler>  she does? 
<monica>  let's get you out of here!!   
<monica> at least you took me down with you! 
<phoebe> i'm sooo sorry!! i just... i keep thinking about mike! i'm crazy about david, and we're having so much fun together. why-why do i miss mike? that's-that's gonna go away, right? 
<monica> i guess, in time. 
<phoebe> yeah. 
<monica> i mean, my feelings for richard are certainly gone. 
<phoebe> you just did it again. chandler, your feelings for chandler are certainly gone! 
< 
<s>  well, phoebe's still pretty hung up on that mike, uh? 
<chandler> i wouldn't read too much into it. 
<s> still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right? 
<chandler> david, let me stop you there 'cause i think i see where this is going. i'm not very good at giving advice. so if you want advice, go to ross, monica, or... joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee. 
<s> sorry, i just... i wish there was something i could do, you know? well, you know phoebe... 
<chandler> seriously, we're gonna do this? 
<s> i'm sorry, uh... i just wish i could make her forget about mike already, you know... why did phoebe and mike break up? 
<chandler> oh, because his penis was too big.  oh, i'm sorry, that's the kind of thing i do.  they broke up because mike didn't want to get married. hey, what if you just let phoebe know you'd be open to marriage? 
<s> that's great! that's great! i-i'll propose to her! 
<chandler> what? 
<s> well, i was probably going to do it at some point. 
<chandler> i didn't mean now... 
<s> why not? it's brilliant!  goodbye mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella!  well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding...  thank you, chandler. sincerely. 
<chandler> well, you're welcome! glad i could help. 
<s>  how do you think i should propose? 
<chandler> david, i'm pretending to read here!! 
<  
<joey> yeah! how you doin'? yeah alright!  
<joey> hey, hey! you said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong? 
<s>  i didn't mean a thong... i meant thongs... 
<joey> you really should have been more clear about that!  
<ross> hey! 
<joey> hey! 
<ross>  you're never going to guess who i just saw downstairs! 
<joey> oh! ah! eh... britney spears!? 
<ross> yeah, she never misses these conferences!  no, i just saw dr. kenneth schwartz! 
<s> oh my god! did you talk to him? 
<ross> yeah... what am i going to say to kenneth schwartz? 
<joey> you could say 
<ross>  ready to go? 
<s> yeah! 
<joey> wha...? you're gonna go now? i thought we could hang out? 
<s> oh i can't... i have seminars all day and i promised ross i would look at his speech. 
<ross> yeah. 
<s> but maybe we can have dinner later? on the balcony? will be romantic. 
<joey>  will you wear a thong? 
<s> i will if you will. 
<joey> oh... you got yourself a very weird deal! 
<ross>  i'm good, i have dinner plans . 
<s> so you'll be ok? 
<joey> yeah, yeah. i've got tons of stuff i could do. i'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming... 
<ross> uh, joe, have you looked outside? 
<joey> no, why?  
<joey> oh man! 
<s> there's an indoor pool, you can swim there!  
<joey> i wasn't gonna swim, i was gonna dig a hole!  
< 
<monica> wow! that mike thing was interesting! i don't know what's gonna happen with phoebe and david. 
<chandler>  i do! want a hint? huh? "i do"  "i do". 
<monica> ok, i'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee. 
<chandler> david is going to propose to phoebe. 
<monica> what?  why? 
<chandler> be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married. 
<monica> chandler, we have talked about this. you are not supposed to give people advice! now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke? 
<chandler> i did! a penis one! look, just so i know, what was so wrong about what i said? 
<monica> they've only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike! she'll say "no", david's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again. 
<chandler> man, that's some bad advice! 
<  
<joey> oh! hey! thank god you guys are here! 
<rachel> hey! hey what's going on? 
<joey> everything is upside down here! it rains all day long, nobody watches tv and ross is famous!  
<rachel> alright, i don't wanna alarm anybody, but monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!  
<monica> ok! when i go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?! 
<chandler> that's why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross! 
<joey> come on, i'll show you guys where to check in  
<monica>  oh, honey, can you make sure we get a king size bed! 
<phoebe>  oh! david, get one for us too! oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! and with mirrors on the ceiling! 
<monica>  and make sure our room isn't next to theirs . 
<rachel> ooh! you guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. that's all, i just wish i could  share that with a guy. 
<phoebe> not joey. 
<rachel> not joey, no, i was just lusting after chandler. 
<monica> yeah, right!  
<s> so, ehm... i'm proposing to pheobe tonight.  
<chandler> tonight?!  isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond?  oh, there it is! 
<s> yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. that's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. and the clarity is uhm... is quite poor. 
<chandler>  nice!  
<chandler> monica, can i talk to you for a sec?  
<monica> ok! 
<chandler> david is going to propose to phoebe tonight! 
<monica> see what happens when you give people advice? i hope you told him not to? 
<chandler> that would be advice!! 
<monica> ok fine. i'll handle this.  phoebe? 
<phoebe> yeah? 
<monica>  i need to talk to you. 
<phoebe> are you leaving "the supremes"?  
<monica> ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. look, david is going to propose to you tonight. 
<phoebe> wow? really? that's fantastic! 
<monica> what are you serious? you wanna marry him? wha... what about mike? 
<phoebe> oh, ok, you want me to marry mike? alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. i can just see it 
<monica> do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer? 
<phoebe> sure! look, ok, bottom line 
< 
<ross> by using ct scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century. 
<s> it's great. you're gonna be the hit of the conference. 
<ross> oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because i won't be constantly interrupted by joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. . 
<joey> hey guys! 
<ross> the chocolates aren't here yet. 
<joey> damnit! 
<s> ross just read me his speech. it's fantastic! 
<chandler> oh, is it on the computer, cuz i'd love to give it a read...? 
<ross> if you want to check your email, just ask!  
<chandler>  what?  may i? 
<rachel>  what's with the rain, geller? i mean, when i signed up for dino week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season. 
<s> actually the wet season is june to december. 
<rachel> it's not the time charlie. 
<chandler>  oh, no, no, no dear god, no! 
<joey> oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot?  oh! secret teapot? 
<chandler> your computer, i don't know wha... everything's gone! 
<ross> wha... what do you mean?  
<chandler> it must be a virus. i think it erased your hard drive. 
<ross> what, oh my god. what did you do? 
<chandler> someone i don't know sent me an e-mail and i opened it. 
<ross> why, why would you open it? 
<chandler> well, it didn't say "this is a virus"!! 
<ross> what did it say? 
<chandler> nude... ... pictures of anna kournikova. i'm so sorry. 
<ross> what... what am i gonna do? my speech is gone, chandler! 
<chandler> it's not gone! i mean, i'm sure you printed out a copy. you have a hard copy, right? 
<ross> no! i don't!! 
<chandler> well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...! 
<joey> it's really gone? 
<ross> yep! i'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career! 
<chandler> i just feel awful. 
<ross> yeah, well you should! i mean, nude pictures of anna kournikova? i mean, she's never even won a major tournament! 
<chandler> well, i tried billy jean king, but...  you know, you and monica have the same "i'm gonna kill you" look...? i can usually make it go away by kissing her...  
<ross> get out!  
<rachel> you know, this happens all the time to my computer at work. 
<ross> well, what do you do? 
<rachel> well, i usually go... play tetris on somebody else's computer. 
<ross> i can't believe this. i can't believe this is happening. i have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! ok? i have to stand up in front of all these people. what am i gonna say? 
<joey> i could teach you a speech that i memorized for auditions. 
<ross> i don't think that your monologue from star wars is gonna help me right now, joe! 
<s> ross, we can solve this. i just heard your speech. we can recreate it! we've got all night! 
<ross> wha... what you really think we can do that? 
<s> oh wait, joey and i are supposed to have dinner . 
<joey> hey don't worry about that! i mean, ross needs you! and rachel and i will stay and help anyway we can. 
<rachel> ugh. 
<ross> alright, ok, let's do it.  uhm, i know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then i move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the mesozoic era, the breakup of pangea, hello!  and then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the triassic. 
<joey> oh, oh! any chance any of this happened in a "galaxy far, far away"? . 
< 
<s> hello? 
<monica> ok, mike, enough is enough, now you love phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole "i never want to get married" thing and step up! 
<s> who is this? 
<monica> this is monica! i'm phoebe's friend. listen, phoebe is back with david and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say "yes" but i know she really wants to be with you! 
<s>  he... he's gonna propose? 
<monica> i... i'm sorry, did you say something? i can't hear through all this damned hair!  
<s> look, if phoebe wants to marry david, she should, i'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you. 
<monica> you don't tell me what to do! i tell you what to do! just call her. she's at the paradise hotel in barbados. and while i've got you, you've got curly hair. what do you do in humidity?  damnit!  
<monica>  well, i hope you're happy! 
<chandler>  oooh! i hope you're happy too, honey! 
<monica> phoebe is going to say "yes" to david. see, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives! 
<chandler> phoebe is going to say "yes"? that's, that's great! 
<monica> no it's not, b'cause she's still in love with mike! 
<chandler> and there's not chance that will work? 
<monica> no, i called him. it's not gonna happen. 
<chandler>  oooooooh! meddler! meddler! 
<monica> well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, i wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place! 
<chandler> this vacation sucks!! 
< 
<joey> i'm so bored! stupid rain, we... we can't do anything. 
<rachel> well, i've brought some books. we could read. 
<joey> hey, it hasn't come to that yet.  
<joey>  hey hey hey! don't mind if i do! 
<s> i'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention  
<joey> hey rach, do you feel like going to a convention? 
<rachel> we can't. we're not pharmacists! 
<joey>  i know we're not, but  frank medeio and...  eva trorro... womba... 
<rachel>  kate miller? 
<joey> kate miller it is.  
<rachel> and... that's the most sex i'm gonna have this weekend. 
<joey> in that case should i make sure it's on real good?  
<rachel> thank you.  
< 
<s> and then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the mesozoic era in the 21st century. 
<ross> yeah, that's it? 
<s> yeah. 
<ross> oh my god, we did it!  
<s> actually i did it ross. you remembered shockingly little of your own speech. 
<ross> yes, but i did make a pyramid out of the bath products. this is amazing, thank you, thank you so much.  that's a pretty necklace. 
<s> thank you. 
<ross> hey, what do you say we celebrate? champagne?  
<s> oh yeah! hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you. 
<ross> oh my god, i love you. 
<s> oh, this is such a cute picture of emma. and is this your son... or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation? 
<ross> that's ben, my son from my first marriage. 
<s> your first marriage? 
<ross> yeah. 
<s> you're married more than once? 
<ross> no.  
<s> so, why did you break up? 
<ross>  oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? she... she was... eh... gay. 
<s> oh my god, this is so cool! 
<ross> ok, odd thing to get excited about! 
<s> no, it's just... i was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay! 
<ross> hey! high-five!  
<s> didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? my fiancé was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner. 
<ross> my wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. she didn't get any fitter. 
<s> right and then everybody finds out and they're like 
<ross> i know! it's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? i mean, call, or leave a note 
<s> i know! 
<ross> and then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome? 
<s> i didn't do that. 
<ross>  me neither. 
< 
<joey> well, who knew? pharmacists are fun. 
<rachel> i know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home. 
<joey> not enough pills in the world, rach. what about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like? 
<rachel> well, let's see. there was a really big guy that i was talking to, with the really nice breasts... 
<joey> but what about back home, anything going on there? anybody you like? 
<rachel>  no. 
<joey> there it is, you're blushing! 
<rachel> no, i'm not blushing, i'm sunburnt! from, you know, the rain. 
<joey> you like someone. tell me who it is. who is it?  
<rachel> no. 
<joey> tell me who it is. 
<rachel> joey!  
<joey> come on who? who do you like? tell me. you're not getting away that easy. who do you like, who? 
<rachel> joey, come on! it doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen. 
<joey> what? why not? rach, who can you not get? 
<rachel> oh!  ok. ok, you really wanna know who it is? 
<joey>  yeah, who is that? 
<rachel> do ya? 
<joey> yeah.   
<s>  i just left you a message! ross and i were gonna go grab a bite, but now that you're here, maybe we can go have that dinner. 
<joey> right, of course. hey, did you guys finish the speech? 
<ross> yep, we got it, we got it.  thank you so much. 
<s> i had a great time. 
<joey> alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because i really wanna know who... 
<rachel> later! la... 
<s> so, shall we? 
<joey> yeah.  
<rachel> ok. see you, bye. 
<s> bye. 
<ross> good night. 
<joey> night.  
<  
<monica> i can't believe she's gonna say yes to david. she's clearly in love with mike. 
<chandler> you know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.  
<s> uh, phoebe, uh, i have... something i wanna say. 
<monica> oh my god, he's gonna do it now. please, i cannot watch this, let's go. 
<chandler> i think we have some time. have you ever heard him talk?  "uh, phoebe, uh, i would be honoured, uh..." spit it out, david! 
<s> uh, phoebe, uh...  you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. of course the sanitation strikes in minsk didn't help! 
<phoebe> sure, ok, yeah. 
<s> but well, now that we're together again, i don't ever want to be apart. so, to that end...  
<phoebe> oh my god, mike! 
<s> it's david, actually! 
<phoebe> no, mike's here. 
<s>  hi mike! 
<s> hi david. chandler. monica...  oh! 
<monica> it's the humidity! 
<s> hi phoebe. 
<phoebe> what are you, what are you doing here? 
<s> i have a question i need to ask you. 
<s> i have a question i was kinda gonna ask her myself. 
<s> yeah, i understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this. 
<s>  ok, would you care for my seat as well? 
<s> actually yeah, that'll be great. 
<s> that's fair, you've had a long trip.  
<s> phoebe, i love you. i mean, i missed you so much these last few months and i thought we were apart for a good reason, but then i suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you. 
<s> kinda stepped on the toes of what i was going to say. 
<s> sorry david, but she really has to know this. 
<s> alright, but after this i want to see you outside. if the rain stops. 
<monica> you're the most incredible woman i've ever met. how can i lose you?  now, i don't actually have a ring... 
<s> i have a ring. 
<chandler> i wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy. 
<s> phoebe, will you marry me? 
<phoebe>  no! 
<s> uhm... ha ha! 
<phoebe> i love you. but i never needed a proposal from you. i just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future. 
<s> we can have any future you want.  
<s> ok, i'm gonna take off. 
<phoebe> david, i'm so sorry, i'm sorry. 
<s> just so i know, if i had asked first... 
<phoebe> yeah, i might have said yes, but that would have been wrong. 
<s> please, you don't have to explain. i mean, perhaps if i hadn't gone to minsk things would have worked out for us. and i wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. it was a good trip!  
<s> is it ok if i hug you now? 
<phoebe> yes!  
<monica>  because of our meddling! alright? 
< 
<chandler> oh, ain't this nice? it's so quiet, i could just lie here all day. 
<monica> i know   
<rachel>  open your drapes! open your drapes! 
<chandler> i'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!  
<monica> the sun is out! 
<chandler> hey! remember when i had corneas? 
<monica> ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and i'll get the magazines and the lotion. 
<chandler> ladies? ross's speech is in 45 minutes. 
<rachel> nooo! 
<monica> damn it! 
<ross>  walls are pretty thin, guys! 
< 
<ross> then we have to await the data from recent mri scans and dna testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating. 
<rachel> look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, i'm so jealous! 
<ross> finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered 
<chandler>  not to mention the cold sores.  
<ross> and that's just the herbivores. i'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.  
<chandler>  really? 
<ross> but all kidding aside, in much the same way that homo ergaster  is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus...  
<s> what? 
<joey> he said "erectus"! 
<s> you're... you're kidding, right? 
<joey> no, he really said it. 
<ross> ... and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus...  
<joey> erectus? 
<rachel> homo. 
< 
<ross> ... in a very real way we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century.  thank you!  
<ross> oh, thanks guys! 
<ross> oh! 
<ross>  ok... now... now we're just holding hands!  
<rachel> all right! well, uh...  we're gonna hit the beach? 
<monica> yeah! 
<rachel>  it was really... great! 
<ross> oh, thank you so much! 
<joey> yeah, and so funny! 
<rachel> oh!  
<ross>  ok!... all right, thanks! thank you so much, you guys!  oh, i can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here! 
<s>  you're kidding, we wouldn't have missed it!  
<s> oh... i'm back! 
<ross>  ok!... uh... excuse me? yeah?  
<ross> hey!  well...?  
<s> you were incredible! 
<ross> yeah? 
<s> you blew them away! 
<ross> oh, i can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! i mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me? 
<s>  i was not! 
<ross> no, it's ok! made me feel like a rock star! 
<s> oh my god!  i'm your groupie! 
<ross>  i'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!  
<ross>  look, i took it too far! 
< 
<monica>  i can't believe it's raining again! oh, it's so unfair!!!  
<phoebe> well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off.  not you guys. you got it going on!  
<monica> so, what are we gonna do today? 
<s> they have a game room downstairs! ping pong and stuff. 
<monica>  ping pong?  honey, they have ping pong! let's play! 
<chandler> i don't think so! 
<monica>  why not? 
<chandler> because you know how competitive you get and well, i say it's cute, others disagree, and i'm lying! 
<monica> i'm not always that bad! 
<chandler> oh, yeah? what happened when we played last time? 
<monica>  i punched you...? 
<chandler> and...? 
<monica> ... phoebe...? 
<phoebe> ... and...? 
<monica> i clunked your heads together!  
<  
<s>  hey! there you are! 
<joey> hey!  as soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya!  
<s> i'm sorry, i can't! i'm running a discussion group all afternoon. 
<joey>  oh... oh, but that's ok, i'll find someone else to do it... i'll do it alone, but... i don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you... 
<s> you know... i feel so bad! i haven't seen you this whole trip and  especially last night... 
<joey>  hey! don't worry about it! it was fine! i ended up having the best time with rachel! i just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on ross's speech...  
<s> actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!

<joey>  i just have one question! 
<rachel> shoot! 
<joey>  what the hell are you doin'??? 
<rachel> i don't know, i'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... i mean, aren't you just a... little curious...  what that would be like?... 
<joey> uh, am i curious? i mean, i am as curious as... as... george!! 
<rachel>  who...? 
<joey> curious george ! you know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat! 
<rachel> oh yes, of course, i remember him! 
<joey> yeah, he had a paper route. 
<rachel> yeah, he did!  oh, see, this is what i'm talking about! 
<joey> no, i know, yeah i know we're great but rach no... this... this can't happen! 
<rachel> but can it... just... happen a little bit? 
<joey>  no, no! it can't happen at all! 
<rachel> but why, why not? 
<joey> because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok?  i have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did i ever say no!  i couldn't do it to ross! 
<rachel> but that wasn't gonna stop you before! 
<joey> i know, i know! but i've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right...  i'm sorry...!

<monica> ah, yeah! 
<s> do you? 
<monica> ah, yeaaah! 
<s> do you? 
<monica> ah yeaaaah! 
<chandler>  do you really find this attractive on him? 
<phoebe>  oh, yeah!  are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by monica, right now?  
<chandler> i think this is the first time in our marriage that i've felt like the more attractive one. 
<phoebe> c'mon mike, you can beat her! knock that dog off her head!  
<monica> oh, damn it! 
<phoebe>  i sleep with him! 
<s>  game, point! 
<monica>  don't get too cocky! remember i won the last one! oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl? 
<s> you know, you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that.  
<monica> no, no, nooo! 
<s> and that's how it's done!  
<chandler> okay-dokay, you've each won a game and i've lost what's felt like a year of my life. so everybody goes home a winner. 
<monica> best out of three? 
<s> that's what i'm thinking. 
<chandler> should i use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil? 
<monica>  serve the ball, chump! 
<s> serve the ball, chump. 
<phoebe>  ok mike, better come back mike, better come back. 
< 
<s> i'm just saying, i have a cabin in the adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be  just nifty! 
<ross> ooh, well. ah, i kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that i wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man.  
<s> jarvis? 
<s>  oh, you're back...  this is my wife, nancy. 
<ross> get out!  
<s> ross, can i talk to you for a minute? 
<ross> yes, please!  so, what's going on? 
<s> uh, well... joey and i broke up. 
<ross> oh my god, wh-what happened? 
<s> joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! i mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus! 
<ross> i knew that was him! 
<s> anyway i just, uh, i think it's for the best. 
<ross>  hey, you ok? 
<s> i guess. there was hum...  there was another reason that i thought it was time to end it with joey. i started to realize that i was having feelings for someone  else.  
<s>  ok geller. last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker. 
<ross> oh, professor clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here. 
<s> yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later? 
<ross>  ok, gentlemen! please! aren't we a little old for this? i mean, we're scientists, right? we're academics. and most importantly i... you-you will have to catch us first. . go, go, go!  
<  
<s> ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41. 
<chandler>  ok, look! enough is enough! 
<monica> no, i have just to have two more points to beat him! 
<chandler> monica, that was also true an hour ago! i mean, please, look at you! your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head! 
<monica> i can't just walk away! i've put in four hours! 
<chandler> but... 
<monica> look! you knew this about me when you married me! you agreed to take me in sickness and in health. well, this is my sickness! 
<chandler> what about the obsessive cleaning? 
<monica> that's just good sense!  
<monica>  aww!  
<chandler> you ok? 
<monica> no, no, no. honey, i'm ok. shake it off!  oh, no! no shaking, no shaking! ooh! ooh!  oh my god! i can't play! 
<s> so you forfeit? 
<phoebe> mike wins? 
<monica> i can't believe it!  i lost! 
<chandler> no, you didn't. 
<monica> what? 
<chandler> because i'm gonna play for ya. 
<phoebe> you can't do that! 
<s> oh, that's ok. i don't care which of them i beat. 
<phoebe> ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister. 
<monica>  honey, you don't have to do this. 
<chandler>  yes, i do. now, i may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because i love you. 
<monica> but... you suck! 
<chandler>  you're welcome, sweetheart.  
<chandler> all right mike, let's get this over with. sudden death. whoever wins this point, wins. 
<s> ok!  
<monica> oh my god! you're good! 
<phoebe> it's like watching porn!  
<chandler> and that's... how... it's done! 
<monica>  oh my god. that was so amazing! when did you  hold on! i almost forgot  loser!  when did you stop sucking? 
<chandler> i never sucked, i actually didn't want you to know how good i was! 
<monica> why? 
<chandler> i don't know. 
<monica> this is so great! now we can enter into doubles tournaments! 
<chandler> that's why! 
< 
<s> thanks! 
<ross> hi. 
<s> are they still looking for us? 
<ross> yeah. the bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores.  you know, we as a group are not the coolest.  
<ross> i don't think they saw us. 
<s> i don't think they did.  
<s> hum, so, i started to say you something earlier, hum...  there was another reason i realized it was time to end it with joey. i kind of realized i... was starting to have feelings... for someone else. 
<ross>  oh. can i... can i ask who? 
<s> i think you know. 
<ross> i think i know too but i've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...  
<ross> i'm sorry... we... we can't. 
<s> all right, all right. 
<ross> i mean, you just went out with my best friend, and i just think it'd be a really really bad idea.  or-or not!   
<rachel> what?  
< 
<monica> oh, the way you crushed mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.you wanna...?  
<chandler> you know, i'd love to, but i'm a little tired. 
<monica> i'll put a pillowcase over my head. 
<chandler> you're on!  
<phoebe> hey! 
<monica> what's up? 
<phoebe> well, okay, mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. and then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want...  
<ross> ... finally... 
<phoebe> is that ross? 
<monica> yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls. 
<phoebe> sounds like he's with someone. 
<chandler> he could be alone. this morning i heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps. 
<monica> wait a minute, i think phoebe's right. you know i hear someone else in there with him.  
<s> ooh... dr. geller! 
<ross> god, you're amazing... i didn't even have to ask you to call me that. 
<monica> oh my god, that's charlie! 
<chandler> she's cheating on joey with ross! 
<phoebe> oh that tart... floozy... giant... 
<monica> i'm not sure about this. 
<phoebe> yeah, you're right. this is none of our business. 
<monica> no i'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. someone get me a glass! 
<phoebe> oh, i'm not gonna do this, okay? i'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend. 
<rachel>  ooh... i love barbados!

<rachel> what? ross and charlie?  wow! she's really making her way through the group, huh? ah, who am i to talk?  
<monica> i can't believe this. rachel and joey? 
<chandler> how about the dinosaur twins in the other room? no-one is manning that wall! 
<monica> i'm on it! 
<chandler> anything? 
<monica> i think i hear curtains closing... 
<phoebe> we've got shoes being kicked off over here. 
<monica> bedsprings, unmistakable! 
<chandler> you do realise that's your brother? 
<monica> not until you said it. somebody switch!  wait a minute... ross and charlie, joey and rachel, phoebe and mike! we're the only people leaving with the same person we came with. 
<chandler> that's not true. i came with monica and i'm leaving with weird al. 
<monica> okay, i've had it with the hair jokes. tomorrow morning, before we leave, i'm going to the salon. 
<chandler> okay buckwheat! 
<phoebe> you gotta hear this, it's great... it's like free porn!   
<ross> weh...*sigh* 
<s> uhm... is everything okay? 
<ross> yeah, it's just... i don't think i can do this... 
<s> ooh... is it because of what might be on the bedspread, because i saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... i could just... 
<ross> no, no!  look, i need to talk to joey. i mean, you guys just broke up. before anything more happens between us, i need to know he's okay with it. 
<s> i uhm... i completely understand. 
<ross> alright, i'm gonna go find them...  i just need a... need a before i can... you know.  grandma... grandma... grandma...  okay, i see you later. 
<s> okay...  
<phoebe> that's the door. he's gone... 
<chandler> and she's... turning on the tv... and watching... miss congeniality! 
<monica> honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!  
<ross> hey, what are you guys doing? 
<phoebe> oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel.  i love you... paradise hotel, golf resort and spa...  
<monica>  yeah, we had a great time, thank you!  
<chandler>  bye! 
<ross> okay, uhm... hey, you guys seen joey anywhere? 
<chandler> he's probably in his room with his current girlfriend charlie. that's the situation as we know it...  
<ross> well, if you see him could you please tell him i'm looking for him? 
<chandler> you got it! 
<ross> thanks!  thank you!

<rachel> oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. just be calm. for all he knows we're just hanging out together. right? just be nonchalant.  that's not nonchalant! 
<joey> no idea what it means. 
<rachel> oh... okay, just hide! 
<ross>  rach? 
<rachel> coming! try under the bed, try under the bed!  
<rachel> there's no room under the bed.  
<ross> is everything okay? 
<rachel> yeah...  
<ross> hey. 
<rachel> hi... 
<ross> you know where joey is? 
<rachel> ...i really don't...  
<ross> can i talk to you for a minute? 
<rachel> yeah, sure...   
<joey> i don't believe this... have you guys been... 
<phoebe> shhh... this is the listening side of the wall.  
<ross> and then she told me that she and joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me. 
<rachel>  uh-huh... right... yeah... 
<ross> and you know i wanted to ask charlie out since the day i met her. 
<rachel>  oh, i know... i know it's been really hard for you. 
<ross> anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. i mean, how angry do you think joey is gonna be? 
<rachel>  that is hard to say, ross. that is hard to say. 
<ross> you know, i gotta go find him. he's gotta be here someplace. 
<rachel> you would think!  
<rachel> joey! 
<joey> is he gone? 
<rachel>  how are you doing this?  
<joey> pssst... 
<rachel> how... wha... hey! what are you... what is this? have you guys been listening this entire time? 
<phoebe> now, what is this? 
<rachel> ah, what is this? well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so i guess this is sixth grade! 
<phoebe> oh no... have you thought about it how complicated this could get? what about ross? 
<joey> well, he's with charlie now. 
<monica> yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. and as his friend, i mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you? 
<joey>  you're a pain in my ass, geller! 
<rachel> all right, look you guys... look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between joey and me and i think we can handle it... 
<chandler> okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? the people that care about you? 
<rachel> sure... 
<chandler> enunciate! 
<rachel> get out!  
<rachel> are they right? 
<joey> probably, yeah... i mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to ross. 
<rachel> yeah... yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight. 
<joey> yeah, i think that'd be best... so, so i'm gonna... i'm gonna take off... 
<rachel>  although... 
<joey>  i like although! 
<rachel> i mean, you know... ross and i haven't dated in like... six years... 
<joey> six years? wow... it's almost as long as highschool... 
<rachel> plus, you know, he is with charlie now. 
<joey> absolutely! he's not thinking about you. 
<rachel> no... 
<joey> i'm thinking about you... 
<rachel> yeah... 
<joey> let's forget about ross...

<ross> learn about jesus...  
<ross> hey! 
<s> so, did you talk to joey? 
<ross> uh, no... no. i couldn't find him. i'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.

<monica> and listen to this...  
<chandler> what d'ya know... it's a treat for the eyes and the ears. 
< 
<joey> whoo, whoo. wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that i'm sitting next to charlie after we broke up. 
<chandler> yeah, it's almost if air barbados doesn't care about your social life. 
<joey> look, does someone mind switching to sit with charlie? 
<ross> oh, i uh, i mean, i... dude, i spent the whole conference with charlie. 
<joey> i understand... 
<ross> no, i'll do it.  
<chandler> wish i could switch with someone. i really don't wanna sit with allen iverson over there.  
<phoebe> uhm... you know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin... 
<s> you should be careful when checking your overhead bins, 'cause items may shift during...

<s> i'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. i promise. 
<phoebe> oh, okay... good. you do that. and then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you. 
<s> maybe i'll sign for it. tear it open. pull out the packing material... 
<phoebe> you know what, we're gonna have sex. let's just leave it there.  
<ross> right, i'm gonna go talk to joey. i think this is the right time. he's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty free". 
<s> okay... good luck.  
<rachel> ross is coming over. i think now would be a really good time to talk to him. 
<joey> i guess so. i'm just... really nervous. 
<rachel> okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner. 
<joey> ooh... 
<rachel> still nervous?

<joey> i couldn't. he was saying all these really nice things about me. i didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. i'm on a edge on chandler. 
<rachel> oh god! alright, fine. you know what joey, forget it. when we go back to new york, i will tell him. 
<joey> thank you. yeah, i appreciate that.  commercial break 
< 
<phoebe> hi, mike's place. 
<s> hey, it's mike. 
<phoebe> ooh, that was fast. 
<s> oh, err... no, she's not here yet. you know, i think i'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone... 
<phoebe> yeah, you can't do that! oh, come on mike, strap on a pair.why don't you just tell her that we got back together. you know, women appreciate honesty. we also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. just f.y.i. 
<s> one more thing... there... might be a picture of precious on my coffee table. 
<phoebe> her name is precious? is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound? 
<s> anyway, i just wanna give you a heads up. 
<phoebe> okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout.   
<s> hi, i'm precious, who are you? 
<phoebe>  i... i'm phoebe. 
<s> phoebe? mike's ex-girlfriend phoebe, the love of his life? that phoebe? 
<phoebe> enchanté  
< 
<monica> oh, i can't wait for everyone at work to see these...  ow! 
<chandler> you go back to work tomorrow night, right? 
<monica> yeah! 
<chandler> so if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn? 
<monica> well, if i had them taken out, then i wouldn't be able to do this.  you like that, right?  
<chandler> what are you singing? 
<monica> it's "bolero" from "10". 
<chandler> it's "ride of the valkyries" from "apocalypse now"... hair problem. and now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... i hate them! 
<monica> you what? you said you liked them. 
<chandler> did i? let's refresh. i believe what i said was that i could see your scalp. 
<monica> fine, so you don't like them. everybody else does. 
<chandler> again, let's journey back... as i recall what rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. and joey... well, joey didn't realise that there was anything different. 
<monica> you know what? i don't care. i like it like this, and i'm gonna keep it. you're just jealous because your hair can't do this...  ouch! 
<chandler> hit yourself in the tooth? 
<monica> and the eye! 
< 
<ross>  hi... there she is. hi emma. oh my god, i missed you.  oh emma, i missed you so much. hey... did you have a good time with grandma green? huh? did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle?  
<rachel> that was one time, ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams. 
<ross> ooh hey, emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? okay? i want you to wait right here. come here sweetie. 
<rachel> aaah... ross, actually there's something that i really need to talk to you about. 
<ross>  okay, shoot! 
<rachel> okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal. 
<ross>  oh no! 
<rachel> what? what is it? 
<ross> oh, major shampoo explosion! 
<rachel> uh, look ross, this really isn't easy. 
<ross> oh, it's all over everything. why? why me?  
<rachel> because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo? 
<ross> i'm sorry, i'm sorry. you were saying? 
<rachel> well, yeah... okay, look it's about me and... 
<ross> oh, not another one! oh my g... and this is moisturiser. it's even harder to clean! why? why do bad things happen to good people? 
<rachel> wow! well, clearly this is not a good time. 
<ross> duh, you think?  
< 
<phoebe> okay, bye. alright, so mike's on his way over. see, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. point is... i'm gonna take off. 
<s> i'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on here. i mean, are you guys getting back together or something? 
<phoebe> alright... susie, can i call you susie? 
<s> my name is precious. 
<phoebe> yeah, i can't say that. uhm... susie, i'm gonna be straight with you... mike and i are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. and he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours. 
<s> i just can't believe this... why? 
<phoebe> well, i don't... 
<s> oh, why would he do this? i mean, what's wrong with me? 
<phoebe> nothing, there's nothing wrong with you. 
<s> i mean, what the hell am i supposed to do now? 
<phoebe> damn it woman, pull yourself together! have some pride, for the love of god.  
<phoebe> okay, not a fan of the tough love. 
<s> i just can't believe that mike didn't give me any warning. 
<phoebe> but he didn't really know, you know. he wasn't planning on coming to barbados and proposing to me... 
<s> he proposed to you? this is the worst birthday ever.  
<phoebe> look, precious... mike's not worth this. you're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, mike's kind of a wang. i mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... he was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? and, i don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend. 
<s> oh, my god, maybe you're right. maybe i don't need him. i deserve to be treated with respect.  
<s> screw you, mike. you're a coward and a bastard, and i hope you rot in hell.  
<phoebe> you're welcome! 
< 
<chandler> honey, you've been in there for a long time... is everything okay? 
<monica> not really.  
<monica> i have a problem. 
<chandler> really? what happened? 
<monica> well, i was dancing around, and singing "no woman, no cry" and i got stuck. 
<chandler> you can't move at all? 
<monica> oh, well, i can move...  
<chandler> if i untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose? 
<monica>  i guess so... 
<chandler>  some of these look a little frayed. 
<monica> yeah, i tried to gnaw myself free. 
< 
<joey> hey! 
<rachel> hi! 
<joey> so, did you err... did you tell ross? 
<rachel> well, i tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. so i guess now it's your turn again. 
<joey> no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... i think it's better if you tell him, you know. it's easier for a woman. that way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... i didn't mean it. i'm so so--ooory.  
<rachel> yeah, 'cause that's what we do. 
<joey> alright, alright, okay, uhm... how 'bout this, how about this? tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together. 
<rachel> okay, that sounds fair. it just means that once again we can't... 
<joey> i know, i know..., but that's okay. i mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals. 
<rachel> no! of course we can wait. alright, so i guess that means good night then? 
<joey> yeah! good night!  
<rachel> goo--ood night! 
<joey> good night!  
<rachel> seriously, good night! 
<joey> stop saying good night. 
<rachel> okay.  commercial break 
< 
<monica> look what i found in the drawer...  and you said i'd never wear this... 
<chandler> now that i untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me? 
<monica> sure, what do you have in mind? 
<chandler> i think you know. 
<monica> really? i don't really feel like it. 
<chandler> this is what i want to do. 
<monica> okay, i just don't get why you like it so much. 
<chandler>  she's an fbi agent, posing as a beauty contestant.  with ross seeing joey and rachel kissing. rosss tares at them.] 
<joey> okay, ross, i realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. let me explain, okay? 
<rachel> we weren't doing anything! 
<joey> rach, he just saw us. 
<rachel> shhh. 
<joey> but what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? one kiss. 
<rachel> no, come on, that is a lie. we also kissed in barbados. okay, we also kissed in barbados, but we didn't plan it, okay? and the only reason that that happened was because i saw you kissing charlie. 
<rachel> yeah, you started it! i've got to chill. 
<joey> look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but.. 
<rachel> we feel so terrible about this, ross. 
<joey> yeah, but it did happen, so...  
<joey> ross? 
<rachel> ross?  can we just close the door? opening credits 
< 
<rachel> ross, say something. anything. 
<ross> so you two are..? 
<ross> and have you .. ed? 
<joey> no, no, no! 
<rachel> no, no, no! 
<ross> but if i hadn't walked in here, would you..? 
<joey> probably.  
<joey> no, no! 
<rachel> ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. you have every right to go nuts. 
<ross> i'm not going nuts. do you see me go nuts? 
<rachel> no, but you know what i mean. 
<ross> hey, hey, hey... if you two are happy, then i'm happy for you.  i'm fine! 
<joey> really? 
<ross> absolutely.  i'm fine! totally fine. i don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really,  i'm fine. i'm not saying i wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. i mean, at first i was like..  but now that i've had time to absorb it; lovin' this. 
<joey> ross.. 
<ross> it's all working out! me & charlie, and you two. you know what we should do? 
<rachel> calm ourselves? 
<ross> no. we should all have dinner. yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. i'll cook!! 
<joey> look, don't you think that will be a little weird? 
<ross> weird? what? what's weird? the only thing weird would be if someone didn't like mexican food, because i'm making fajitas!!  
<joey> i do like fajitas. 
< 
<monica> god, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. there's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. there are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives. 
<chandler> there's a hair in my coffee.  
<phoebe> hey guys! 
<monica> hey. 
<phoebe> hey, have you seen frank jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets. 
<chandler> you know, it's funny. every time you say "triplets," i immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.  
<monica> that's sweet. drink your hair. 
<phoebe> hey, what's all this stuff? 
<monica> oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies. 
<phoebe> ooh, babies! oh, this one is so cute, get this one! 
<monica> that's not really how it works. 
<phoebe> oh, how does it work? 
<monica> i don't know! 
<phoebe> well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, bill and colleen. they adopted a kid. i'm sure they'd help you. 
<monica> thanks, that would be great. hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?   remember what we talked about. when we're in a public place, there are certain rules.  about!! 
<phoebe> hey! 
<phoebe> good to see you. 
<monica> hi frank. 
<monica> oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!  
<monica> which one is which again? pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse. and that's chandler climbing on chandler, and that's leslie throwing bagels at him. to adopt triplets?" no! 
< 
<joey> ah, can i just say i know we're doing this for ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date. 
<rachel> well, what would we be doing? 
<joey> i'd take you out for a romantic night. some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home... 
<rachel> feel me up? 
<joey> in a carriage!  
<joey> hey, charlie! 
<rachel> hey. 
<s> hi, hi. so.. dreading this? 
<rachel> oh, you bet.  
<joey> so, did you bring a little something for ross? 
<s> actually.. it's stuff you left at my apartment. 
<joey> oh. oh, thanks. 
<s> and you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want. 
<joey> yeah, i didn't throw any of that out..  
<ross> i thought i heard voices! hi charlie!  hi joey.  and.. oh! you're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend.  i'm just kidding, i know rachel, i know.  come, please come in. come in. 
<rachel> okay, well, we brought you some wine. 
<ross> oh! that is so thoughtful.  she's a keeper. and what did you bring me?  
<joey> uh, actually, that's.. 
<ross> underwear, a toothbrush, and van halen cd. i can use all these things!! 
<s> gosh, ross, you know, you seem a little... 
<ross> what? fine? because i am! aren't you? aren't you? aren't you? you see? who else is fine? 
<joey> okay, listen, hey, ross. why don't you try to relax, okay? maybe have a drink. 
<ross> you know what? that is a very good idea. i'm gonna go make a pitcher of margaritas.  
< 
<phoebe> oh, god. so adorable. look at them sleeping there like angels. moments, 'cause before you know it, they're gonna be awake again. 
<phoebe> well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute. 
<phoebe> oh, god, the last time i babysat them, they did the funniest thing.. 
<phoebe> that's a, that's a long time. it is, phoebe. there's just so many of them. you know, two i can handle. two's great. you just hold one in each hand, but what do i do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on. i've got no more hands to protect my area! there's three of them, phoebe, three! 
<phoebe> yeah, i know, frank. i counted them when they were coming out of my area. oh, no, no, no, i can't say it, it's too horrible. no. 
<phoebe> what? 
<phoebe> oh my god, frank, are you thinking of leaving? because i didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them! that. no. i just was thinking that, you know, maybe you could take one. 
<phoebe> what?! you can't separate them! that's terrible. which one? 
< 
<monica> thank you so much for seeing us. phoebe has told us such great things about you guys. 
<s> oh, please, we're happy to help. 
<s> we went through the same thing when we were adopting. 
<chandler> so, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?  
<chandler> i mean, you have a lovely home. 
<monica> well, we appreciate anything you can tell us. 
<s> well, actually, i think this might help.  
<s> it's pretty much all the information you need. 
<monica> oh my god! 
<s> everything is broken down into categories, and then cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms in the back. 
<monica> thank you.  i think i just had a tiny orgasm. 
<s> i know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. adopting owen was the best thing that ever happened to us. 
<chandler> that's great.  can i see the book?  
<chandler> you want me to wash my hands first, don't you? 
<monica> it's.. it's just so pretty and white. 
<s> the bathroom is down the hall, to your left.  
<s> i would have told him to do it too. 
<monica> can i adopt you?  
<chandler> hey, you must be owen. 
<s> yeah. 
<chandler> i'm chandler. hey, i was in the scouts too. 
<s> you were? 
<chandler> yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother. 
<s> huh? 
<chandler> you know how to use a compass? 
<s> i have a badge in it. 
<chandler> you do? that's fantastic! 
<s> you wanna see it? 
<chandler> i'd love to, but i gotta get back to talking to your parents. they're telling us all about how they adopted you. 
<s> what?!? 
<chandler> what? 
<s> i'm adopted?  
<chandler> i got nothing. 
< 
<ross> the first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood. 
<rachel> well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some. 
<ross> oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? you know? just the four of us. just hangin'. 
<joey> dude, are you okay? and when are the fajitas gonna be ready? 
<ross> i'm fine! hey, i'm great! i'm just.. i'm just proud of us. there's no weirdness, no tension. 
<rachel> no awareness. 
<ross> we make a great foursome. we should do more stuff together. ooh! let's take a trip. okay, where do you think we - we can go?  
<ross> my fajitas!!  
<rachel> look, charlie, i just want you to know. ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of joey and me. you know, he normally doesn't drink like this. 
<s> oh, you know what? this is nothing. my father is a raging alcoholic.  
<s> oh, i'm sorry, have i made this evening uncomfortable?  
<ross> fajitas! be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!! 
<rachel> ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!  
<ross> that is gonna hurt tomorrow! 
< 
<phoebe> okay, well, this is crazy. can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we? 
<phoebe> insane. 
<phoebe> alice would never go for it, right? tired, too, i think we've got her onboard. 
<phoebe> well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. which one would you be willing to give up? 
<phoebe> frank jr.jr.? good one. i mean, you know, he's really funny. like, the other day he made up this joke. 
<phoebe> uh-huh. i'm a frog"? a talking frog!  oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny. 
<phoebe> well, alright, that's fine. what about leslie? she's, she's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet. 
<phoebe> alright, so that leaves chandler. chandler, no. no, no. she's my little genius. i got big hopes for her. she's gonna be a doctor or a realtor.. 
<phoebe> wow, frank. i think we just ran out of kids. oh, wow. phoebe, i don't think i can give one of them up. i mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're my babies. 
<phoebe> i'm sorry, frank. i didn't realise things were so bad. you know, i'll help out more. i can - i can babysit any time you want. you name the day, and i'll be there. 
<phoebe> well, that's not good. but you know, i can move some stuff around, and i'll be there. you and alice just take the whole day together. 
<phoebe> are you kidding? that's what sisters are for. at them! aw. i love you so much.  oh crap, don't wake up, don't wake up! 
< 
<chandler> where are bill and colleen? 
<monica> they're in the kitchen getting something to eat. can you believe how nice they are? 
<chandler> we have to leave!! 
<monica> why? what did you do in the bathroom? 
<chandler> i didn't get to the bathroom. i bumped into owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. and there's a slight chance i may have told him. 
<monica> oh my god, where's my purse? no, you know what? i can replace everything in there. get that binder, and let's go!  
<s> hey. 
<s> some little snacks for everybody. oh, you don't have to eat the sour worms. those are for owen. 
<s> i'll go get him in a second. by the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet. 
<chandler> but kids are so intuitive. don't you think on some level he already knows?  
<s> i'm adopted?! 
<chandler> see? intuitive! 
<s> what? where did you hear that? 
<s> he told me! and he paid me 50 dollars not to tell. 
<chandler> which technically now you should give back! 
<s> you told him he's adopted? 
<chandler> i'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that santa is real." 
<s> he isn't?! out of here, baby! 
< 
<ross> everyone? i would like to make a toast to rachel and joey. 
<rachel> ooy. 
<ross> and to love. ah, love. l-o-v-e, love. l is for life. and what is life without love? 
<rachel> oh my god, are we supposed to answer? 
<ross> o is for "oh, wow!" the v is for this very surprising turn of events, which i'm still fine with by the way. e is for how extremely normal i find it. that you two are together. and now one day you might get married and have children of your own.  
<joey> dude, are you okay? 
<ross> totally. 
<rachel> ross, you don't seem okay. it must be the pressure of entertaining. i think everyone would feel better if we had some flan. 
<s> wait, ross. ross. i - i have to take off. 
<ross> no! 
<s> i'm sorry, i have a really early class in the morning, but this has been lovely. 
<ross> wasn't it? and you thought it would be awkward with joey and that you never really liked rachel. 
<s> you're on fire! i'll call you in the morning, okay? 
<ross> okay. 
<s> alright.  
<s> god, rachel, what ross just said that is just so.. 
<rachel> oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me. 
<s> bye.  
<ross> okay, i guess it's just flan for three! hey, hey, that rhymed! 
<rachel> you know what, ross? i think we're gonna take off too. 
<ross> oh, oh. of course. god, i'm so stupid. you guys are a couple now. i mean, you probably just want to be alone. 
<rachel> no, no, it's just that it's getting late... 
<ross> hey, hey, it's fine. it's totally fine. we've got plenty of margaritas. it's all good.  
<ross> i don't even know what that's for.  
<joey> you know what? i think i'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay. 
<rachel> yeah, that's probably a good idea. 
<joey> yeah. i'll see you in the morning. 
<rachel> uh-huh. okay. you know what, joey, i don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this. 
<joey> it doesn't look good, does it?  
< 
<joey> morning. here you go. 
<ross> thanks. did you stay here all night? 
<joey> yeah. 
<ross> so you took off my pants and shoes? 
<joey> no, no, no. you actually did that when you were dancing to the chicago-soundtrack. look, ross, about, about rachel and i. listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? because nothing is gonna happen. 
<ross> what do you mean? 
<joey> well, she and i said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. and clearly.. 
<ross> hey, what are you talking about? i'm fine! 
<joey> it's okay, ross, alright? i totally understand. of course you're not fine. you're.. you're ross and rachel. 
<ross> except we're not. i mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. oh my god, is that right? has it been that long? 
<joey> that's what i hear, yeah. 
<ross> this is crazy. i mean, six years? and because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? can i ask you something? really, what is this thing with you and rachel? 
<joey> come on, i mean, you know me, you know... 
<ross> joey. 
<joey> i'm crazy about her. 
<ross> and she feels the same way? 
<joey> i think so. 
<ross> well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on. 
<joey> yeah, but, ross, i mean, you're not okay with it. 
<ross> no, but i wanna be. hey, i will be. besides, i'm with charlie, right? oh my god, i'm still with charlie, aren't i? i mean, she didn't see the dance, did she? 
<joey> no, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. are you sure about this? 
<ross> yeah, i'm sure. 
<joey> and we're okay?  ending credits

<monica> hey, phoebs 
<phoebe> hey. 
<monica> uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. bill and colleen hate us. 
<chandler> owen didn't know he was adopted, and monica told him. 
<monica> what? 
<phoebe> still, he had to find out sometime. 
<chandler> yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?  
<chandler> i'm gonna go tell emma she was an accident.   rachel tonight, uh? 
<joey> yeah. it's actually our first official date 
<chandler> wow! so tonight may be the night! you're nervous? 
<joey> naa, no. this is the part i'm actually good at. 
<chandler> what must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing. 
<joey>  it's ok! 
<chandler> how can you be so confident? 
<joey> well, i... i know exactly what i'm gonna do! 
<chandler> really? like you have a routine? 
<joey> no, no no no no. see. each woman is different.you have to appreciate their uniqueness. 
<chandler> really? 
<joey> no, i do six things! first, i look deep in her eyes. then, i kiss her. next i take my hand and i softly graze her thigh. 
<chandler> you mean like this?  
<joey> no! not like that, no no. no, like this.

<ross>  why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators? 
<chandler>  why...why? 
<ross> still, i can't believe that's sprayed on... i mean, it looks really good. i wonder if i should get one! 
<chandler> sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off. 
<ross> so, do you get colours or just french tips? 
<monica> there. here's their card.

<monica> oh, what are we gonna do! i don't wanna see her!! 
<phoebe> ugh, let's just cut her out! 
<monica> what? 
<phoebe> cut her out of our lives! just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!

<s> ooh, that accident must have been terrible. you look positively ghastly. 
<chandler> well, aren't you a treat. 
< 
<monica> i can't believe you tried to cut me out. why phoebe, why? 
<phoebe> it was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? you were really controlling and compulsive and shrill. 
<monica> i'm still all those things! 
<phoebe> you're also so generous and kind and scrappy! 
<monica>  i am scrappy. 
<phoebe> exactly! look, no matter what i tried to do, i couldn't keep you out of my life. of all the people i have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in. 
<monica> it's because i'm scrappy. 
<phoebe> yeah, you are. and i'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because i don't know what i would do without you. 
<monica> i won't know what i would do without you.  
<monica> well, i guess we should go back in. when you gave me another chance, i guess we should do the same for amanda. 
<phoebe> yeah, i guess you're right.  
<s> can you believe it. i've never had any professional dance training.  
<  
<s> now, let me explain how this works. you go into the booth, and... 
<ross> i'm gonna stop you right there, glenda. okay? does it look like this is my first time, huh? now i want 4 two's... and i want them all on my back. 
<s>  okay...  
<ross> wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?  
<ross> which... which... which... which one is it?

<  
<rachel> what is the matter with us? 
<joey> well, i know what's the matter with me. 
<rachel> no, i mean with us, you know. i mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult? 
<joey> i don't know.  
<chandler> that fake british woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... hey! 
<rachel> hi! hey, listen, can we ask you a question? when you and monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that? 
<chandler> kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys... 
<rachel> no, no, no... no, i mean... se-x-u-ally... 
<joey> yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong? 
<chandler> actually, no. no, it felt right. you know, it felt like uhm... i can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.  
<chandler> i can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... well, i'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy. 
<rachel> well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us. 
<joey> yeah, yeah... absolutely. i mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit. 
<rachel> right, totally. 
<joey> yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it. 
<rachel> yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex. 
<joey> that's a... pla-an.  
<joey>  wow... i did not see this coming. 
<rachel> i know. 
<joey> i don't get it. i mean, i was so sure this was what i wanted. 
<rachel> hmmm... me too...  
<rachel> i wonder how monica and chandler could do it? 
<joey> i guess they weren't as good friends as we are.  
<rachel> aah... i bet you're right.  
<joey> so... 
<rachel> yeah. 
<joey> i love ya. 
<rachel> love you too... alright, i'm going to bed.

<ross> really? did you count mississipily?  
<ross> dude, you're not tanned. 
<chandler> no, i just had to get a picture of this.  
<chandler> i see you later!   
< 
<monica>  hey guys! ross, rachel 
<chandler> honey, i got us that room at the woodford inn this weekend. 
<monica> that place in vermont? you can take a hint! 
<rachel> wait, you can't go away this weekend! it's emma's birthday! 
<ross> yeah! 
<rachel> we're having a party. 
<monica> well, can't you just have the party when we get back? 
<ross> no. 
<rachel> no, that day... that won't be her real birthday! 
<chandler> gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was! 
<ross> c'mon you guys, this is really important to us. 
<monica> well, i'm sorry, but chandler and i could really use a weekend away. you know, to reconnect... emotionally. 
<chandler> there's this thing i really want us to do. i read about it in maxim... 
<rachel> well, can't you just go to vermont the next day? 
<ross> yeah, we want everyone to be there. as much as i hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister. 
<rachel> and i mean, you know, you guys... this is a big deal. i mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle! 
<monica> all right, we'll stay. we can just drive up after the party. 
<chandler> fine, but if we end up not doing this maxim thing because of this party... 
<monica> believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that! opening credits 
< 
<rachel> you know pheebs, when i was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all. 
<phoebe> oooh, i love family traditions like that. when uhm... when ursula and i were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food! 
<ross>  hey guys! rachel 
<ross> hey, i brought the camera for emma's video. 
<rachel> oh, good, good! we had this idea to make a birthday video for emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18. 
<phoebe> oh, cool!! wow, it's like a time capsule! 
<ross> yeah! 
<phoebe> oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a tv that hasn't even been invented yet! with friends who right now are just like babies! and they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people! 
<ross> that's the hope! so, is emma awake yet? 
<rachel> oh no, it's still nap time. but she'll be up soon. 
<ross> ah, and where is joey? 
<rachel> i said it's still nap time.  
<ross>  hey, there is uncle joey! 
<joey> hey! 
<ross> hey, say something to emma on her 18th birthday! 
<joey> 18, uh?  
<ross> joey, no! 
<joey> what, what!? it's for her hot friends! 
<ross> when they see this you'll be 52! 
<joey> and starting to think about settling down! 
<rachel> hey joey, will you please set this up for people to put emma's presents on? 
<joey> i'd love to! yeah! 
<joey>  we were supposed to bring presents? 
<phoebe> yeah! i wrote emma a song. 
<joey> oh, yeah! how was i supposed to know? 
<phoebe> joey, it's a birthday party. 
<joey> yeah, but for a one-year-old. what's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. just a cup with a picture of elmo on it dressed as a farmer. and he's standing next to this cow and the cow says "el-moo"!  yeah... that's a funny cup!  
<monica> hey! 
<chandler> hey hey! where's the birthday girl? 
<rachel> oh, she's still napping 
<chandler> oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening. 
<rachel> look, i know that you guys really want to get to vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? emma will never have a first birthday again. 
<monica> all right... you're right. we're sorry. now let's wake up emma and get the fun time started! 
<rachel> no really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up. 
<monica> are you freaking kidding me, green?  jack and 
<s> hi! 
<ross>  hey! 
<monica> so glad you came! 
<s> i can't believe emma is already one! 
<s>  i remember your first birthday! ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you. he pulled on his testicles so hard! we had to take him to the emergency room! 
<ross>  there's something you didn't know about your dad! 
<joey> hey mr. and mrs._geller! let me help you with that. 
<s> thank you! 
<joey> oh man, this is great, uh? the three of us together again! you know what would be fun? if we gave this present to emma from all of us! 
<s> which one are you?  
<monica> i can't believe emma is still asleep! 
<chandler> i know, what are we gonna do? 
<monica> i've got a plan. i've got a plan. i'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. you're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up! 
<chandler> i'm not going to vermont with this monica! 
<joey> hey pheebs, you know what? i was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe i could do something for emma using my talents! 
<phoebe> so you’re gonna... hit on her? 
<joey> no, no, no! my talents as an actor! 
<phoebe> oh! 
<joey> you know, i could like maybe... i could do a dramatic reading of one of her books! 
<phoebe> or you could stick a fork in an apple! 
<joey> hey, i think emma might like it! 
<rachel> oh! emma might like what? 
<joey> um, my present! 
<rachel> what did you get her? 
<joey> actually we prepared performances. 
<phoebe> separate performances. 
<joey> but equally real! 
<rachel> well, this sounds like fun! well, you know what? actually? people are getting a little antsy waiting emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now? 
<phoebe> sure, yeah! 
<joey>  o k. 
<rachel>  all right, let’s get this party started, huh? joey and phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us. 
<ross> oh, great! 
<phoebe>  are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared? 
<joey> hey, i do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting! 
<rachel> so, joey, what are you gonna do for us? 
<joey> i will be doing a dramatic reading of one of emma’s books. 
<rachel> oh, ok, which one? 
<joey> uh, why, it’s a...  one of her favorites, uh,  “riding the storm out. coping with post-partum depression” eesh!  “love you forever”. love you forever. by robert munsch. published by firefly books. printed  in mexico. a mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang “i’ll love you forever, i’ll like you for always, as long as i'm living, my baby you’ll be”. . and while he rocked her, he sang “i’ll love you forever, i’ll like you for always, as long as i'm living, my baby you’ll be”. 
<rachel>  wow! that was amazing! 
<ross> thank you so much for that gift! chandler 
<ross> amazing... amazing. 
<rachel> oh, phoebe, i’m sorry! phoebe has prepared something as well. 
<phoebe> that’s right, i've prepared a song for emma. from my heart to hers. for there’s no greater gift, than the gift of music.  emma! your name poses a dilemma. 'cause not much else rhymes with emma! maybe the actor richard crenna, he played the commanding officer in rambo. happy birthday emma! 
<rachel> is that it? 
<phoebe> no, of course not! i also, you know, prepared a reading . “sex and the single mother.  finding your g-spot. 
<s> no, no, no, no, no!

<s> hello emma. happy eighteenth birthday. 
<s> right now that seems so far away, seventeen years. 
<s> yes, you’ll be all grown up by then. we’ll be... well your grandfather and i might not be here. 
<s> that’s true! this message could becoming to you from beyond the grave, emma! 
<s> after all, my parents died very young.

<s> remember, emma, heart disease kills women too! ross (stops 
<s> ok, cut! great. that was... that was just... yeah! 
<rachel> ross, um, don’t forget to get a shot of emma’s cake. it’s in a box in the fridge. 
<ross> sure. 
<rachel> oh, you're gonna love this cake. i got it from a bakery in new jersey, corino’s. 
<monica> oh my god, that place has the creamiest frosting! i use to hitchhike there when i was a kid. 
<rachel> well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they’ll copy it in icing! 
<monica> oh, did you do a picture of emma? 
<rachel> yes! on a cake shaped like a bunny. 
<ross> uh, rach? does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? say for bachelorette parties? 
<rachel> ross, what are you talking about?  oh! oh my god! they put my baby’s face on a penis! phoebe 
<rachel> why you guys this isn't funny, all right? if i wanted this cake to be a disaster i would have baked it myself! joey (staring looks delicious? 
<s> jack, look at this. 
<s> i know what you're thinking judy, the resemblance is uncanny! 
<ross> i am this close to tugging on my testicles again. rachel ok? i went all the way to new jersey so that i could have the perfect cake for my daughter’s birthday and i need a bunny cake, right now! 
<ross> ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. . that is a weird sentence! 
<rachel> oh! believe you me! i am going to bring this cake back, i don't even want it in my home...  joey, don't touch it!! 
<joey> i'm so confused! 
<rachel>  yes, yes. i still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts! 
<chandler> to be fair this one does have nuts.   
<ross> hey mon, that was really nice of you to loan rachel your car so she could go and get the cake. 
<monica> oh. so nice of her to pull my hair, 'till i dropped the key! 
<ross> well, you know what? while we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to emma for her 18th birthday, huh?  ok! 
<chandler> hi emma! it's the year 2020. are you still enjoying your nap? 
<monica> we're aunt monica and uncle chandler, by the way. you may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years! 
<chandler> we used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. because of you! happy birthday.  
<monica> ross, rachel promised it would be over by now. we seriously have to go, if we want to get to vermont. i called them and the last train leaves in a half hour. 
<phoebe> and you know, i have a massage client soon. 
<ross> you guys, just please.. a little bit longer. i promise, rachel will be back with the cake any minute. monica, remember.. the frosting? huh? 
<monica> alright, 5 more minutes.  
<ross>  hello?  oh no! what happened?  ok ok, where are you? . ok, i'll be right there.  
<chandler> was that emma? is she up? 
<ross> no, rachel got pulled over for speeding. she forgot her licence so now i have to bring it to her. 
<phoebe> well, if you're leaving, i'm definitely gonna go.

<joey> well, that one did not have emma's face on it. 
<phoebe> no, it did not. 
<joey> no. 
<s> well, we better get going, it's late. jack's not allowed to drive at night anymore. he has trouble staying in his lane.

<joey>  oh! well that's it! he's the last one to go. i'm locking you guys in.  
<chandler> you do know, i can just turn them the other way around, right?

<joey> what? you never said anything about an audition! 
<s>  let me start over. i just got a call about an audition. i think you can still make it. it's down at the astor theatre and you need to have a monologue prepared. 
<joey> a monologue? i don't have..  i got it.  aah! so... i'm gonna take off! 
<phoebe> wh.. what? no wait, you don't get to leave! i've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute! 
<monica> yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now! 
<phoebe> well, oh, ok now... only one of us has to stay with emma. ok, and as the person who realized that, i get to go! 
<monica> no! no! let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying. 
<joey> oh! i got it! ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. alright? whoever gets the highest number gets to go first. 
<monica>  ok, ten. 
<joey> okay, monica picks ten, i call nine! anyone else? 
<phoebe> no, lets just draw straws. 
<joey> or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the.. 
<chandler> i'm begging you stop. 
<joey> right. 
<monica> her birthday. we can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays! 
<phoebe>  yeah!! let's do that! 
<chandler>  that sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in vermont! 
<monica> everybody get your toys!  
<phoebe> ok! i want the dolphin! 
<chandler> thats a bear. 
<phoebe> i'm too excited! 
<monica> phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, joey, you get the robot, and chandler and i get the dog. ok, and the race is going to go  from here to here. now the one who comes in last, stays!

<phoebe> go! go! 
<joey> come on robot!

<joey> way to go robot! 
<phoebe> good job alan! 
<joey> hey, good race you guys. 
<phoebe> yeah, see you later!  
<monica> no! no, no... wait! we didn't lose.  the rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically... 
<chandler> they left.  the freeway. rachel is driving monica's porsche, while using her mobile phone. ross is sitting next to her.] 
<rachel>  no, there isn't time to go to the bakery. we're just gonna come home... everybody left? alright, well just tell emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can.  bye...  
<ross> rachel! 
<rachel> ooh! god! sorry! 
<ross>  i can't believe they gave you a ticket. you're such a good driver.  
<rachel> emma's awake. 
<ross> yeah? 
<rachel> i can't believe this. this is her first birthday. she's awake. we're not even there. everybody left. we still have this stupid obscene cake. 
<ross> hey, maybe i can fix that, you know. try to turn it into something else.  
<rachel> oh, why do you even bother? i already ruined her first birthday... and do you know how important these early experiences are ross? very! according to the back cover of that book that you gave me. 
<ross> rach, she's not going to remember this. 
<rachel>  i guess... oh, i just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing "happy birthday". then we would all go into... hey get out of the road you stupid student driver!!!  they have to learn! 
<ross>  hey! 
<rachel> what? 
<ross> it's not bad. 
<rachel>  oh my god! look what... you made it into a bunny. how did you do that? 
<ross> well, i just made these two things uhm... cheeks. and then i split this to make ears. 
<rachel> well, i'm very impressed. 
<ross> some can sing, some can dance. i apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures. rachel and joey's apartment. chandler, monica and emma are sitting on the floor, and emma's stuffed animals are lined up in front of them.] 
<monica> now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size. 
<chandler> i'm sorry, is this a game for emma or for monica? 
<monica> game? 
<chandler> emma, you even know it's your birthday today? you're one! one-year-old, that's little.  
<chandler> ooh! that's my girl! 
<monica> that's how old you are. 
<chandler> did i teach her that? did i just... impart wisdom? 
<monica>  ooh, i want one... 
<chandler> me too...  
<chandler> there's no-one around. why don't we just take this one? 
<monica> ...and head to canada! 
<chandler> i was kidding. 
<monica> i wasn't. let's get going!  
<phoebe> hey, are ross and rachel back? 
<chandler> no, not yet. 
<phoebe> oh good, i didn't miss the party. 
<monica> what about your massage client? 
<phoebe> i just felt so bad, missing this. so i just slipped him a little something, you know. as long as i'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.  
<joey> okay, if ross and rachel ask, i've been here the whole time. the whole time!  
<joey>  i've been here the whole time! 
<ross> joey, we just saw you come in. you ran past us on the stairs. 
<rachel> i don't care that you left. i'm just glad that you're here. thanks you guys! 
<chandler> hey, guys! come on! you gotta see what emma just did. 
<rachel> what? 
<chandler> emma, how old are you? how old are you today?

<ross> what's wrong? are you okay?

<joey> no! no... and, for the record, i've also never given her a frosting from a can!

<rachel> of course, i'd be honored! 
<chandler> thanks! 
<monica> thank you!  
<joey> u-u-um, i think there's been an oversight. 
<chandler> joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested. 
<monica> yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much "with the words". 
<joey> whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!! 
<monica> clearly we were wrong. 
<joey> i gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? and i know how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and i would love to help you get one.

<joey>  oh, monica and chandler's recommendation. i want it to sound smart but.. i don't know any big words or anything, so... 
<ross> why don't you use your thesaurus? 
<joey> what did i just say? 
<ross> watch.  here, you ehm... you highlight the word you want to change. go under tools and the thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list of choices. you can pick the word that sounds smartest. 
<joey> oh my god, that's great! i'm smart!! no, no, i'm...  "brainy, bright, clever", i love this thing! look out ladies, joey tribbiani's got the whole package!!

<s> it's his dad. 
<rachel> huh... wow, so he's gotta be...

<s> myron. hmm... i told you he was old! 
<rachel> oh... sit down, sit down. oh, honey, you know, i once also almost married somebody that i didn’t love. do you remember barry? 
<s> humpf, remember him? how we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep. 
<rachel> sometimes just nodding is ok.  uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying barry was the best decision that i ever, ever made. honey, you deserve true love. your soulmate is out there, somewhere. someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!

< 
<joey> hey, finished my recommendation.  here. and i think you’ll be very, very happy. it’s the longest i ever spent on a computer without looking at porn. 
<chandler>  i don’t... uh... understand. 
<joey>  some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya? 
<monica>  it doesn’t make any sense. 
<joey> of course it does! it’s smart! i used the the-saurus! 
<chandler> on every word? 
<joey> yep! 
<monica> alright, what was this sentence originally?  
<joey> oh, ‘they are warm, nice, people with big hearts’. 
<chandler> and that became ‘they are humid prepossessing homo sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...? 
<joey> yeah, yeah and hey, i really mean it, dude. 
<monica> hey joey, i don’t think we can use this. 
<joey> why not? 
<monica> well, because you signed it baby kangaroo tribbiani . hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself! 
<chandler> you know what? you don’t need a thesaurus, just write from here,  your full sized aortic pump.

<rachel> amy, hi! 
<s> i took your advice, i left myron.

<joey> but uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? rach, please tell me we’re getting rid of her. 
<rachel> joey, i can’t do that! 
<joey> oh, come on! last night i was finishing off a pizza and she said  "uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!" i don’t need that kind of talk in my house! 
<rachel> well joey, uhm look, i know that she’s difficult, but i think it’s really good that she’s here. 
<joey> 'cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone? 
<rachel> no, it's just... look, you know, when i first moved to the city i was a lot like her! i was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me. 
<joey> yeah, monica made us! 
<rachel> well, uhm... whatever, i have really appreciated it, 'cause i don’t think i would be the person that i am today if it wasn’t for you guys. see, i wanna help amy the way you guys helped me. and i know it’s gonna take patience, but that’s ok. 
<s> good morning. 
<joey> yeaah. 
<rachel> amy, that’s what i was supposed to wear today, that’s why i hung it on the door. 
<s> oh, sweety, you can’t pull this off. 
<rachel> amy, you know what? i was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future. 
<s> oh, i can’t, honey. i’m gonna go get my eyebrows shaped.  i am not happy.  oh... sure you wanna eat that? 
<joey>  i’m curvy, and i like it! 
< 
<phoebe> hi. i just had the worst anniversary ever. 
<chandler> i doubt that! tell her about us last year. 
<monica> oh, well, i bought chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song. 
<ross> seriously? 
<chandler> word! 
<phoebe> well, mine was worse than that. 
<rachel> well, what happened? 
<phoebe> we were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing... 
<rachel> oh, that is so tacky. 
<phoebe> well, that’s what i said, but it turns out, mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night! 
<monica> oh my god, mike was gonna propose? 
<rachel> phoebe, that’s huge! 
<ross> well, do you wanna marry him? 
<phoebe> yeah, i really do! yes, but, after i dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, i don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! i mean, i said no in barbados and now this! 
<chandler> she's right! if i were a guy and...  did i just say if i were a guy..? 
<monica> maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him! 
<phoebe> oh, i don't know, i don't know, isn't that a little desperate? 
<monica> i proposed to chandler!  alright, moving on... 
<chandler> oh, i don't think it was desperate, i think it was amazing! 
<monica> thank you. 
<phoebe>  well, do you think i should propose? 
<rachel> i think it could be kind of great! 
<ross> absolutely! you'll love the feeling! there's nothing like it! 
<phoebe> ok, ok, so how should i do it? 
<monica> how about at a game, on the big screen? 
<rachel>  uuuh!! how about at a footlocker?  
<monica> what? what? he obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it! 
<phoebe> yeah, that does make sense. ok, now, would... would you two  like that? 
<chandler> sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?  
<s>  nana is on the phone  
<rachel>  oh! that's interesting, since she died seven years ago!! 
<s> she did? who got her condo in boca? 
<rachel>  hello?  oh, it's our nanny!  hi! oh... god! i hope you feel better! ok, bye!  that's molly, she's sick. can you watch emma today? 
<ross> no, i can't. i have back-to-back classes. did molly say what she had? because my throat's been hurting? 
<rachel> menstrual cramps. 
<ross> i don't think that's what this is. 
<rachel>  can any of you watch emma? 
<monica> no, sorry sweety.. 
<phoebe> no, i've got work and then i'm proposing.. 
<rachel>  great, shoot, what are we gonna do? 
<s> well, i can do it. 
<rachel>  well, actually...

<ross> fine, we'll call the next one ella. 
<rachel>  wha... the next one? 
<ross>  okay, um... i don't want her watching our baby. 
<rachel> ross, i am trying to help her become a better person. this is a huge breakthrough for her! she just offered to do something for another human being!! 
<ross> i... i don't know.. 
<rachel> ross, i'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows  shaped to do this alright? do you understand how important that is in our world?  
<s> um... listen, i couldn't help but overhear... 'cause i was trying to... listen, let me do this alright? i really wanna help you guys out, and plus rachel's been so wonderful to me...   
<rachel> absolutely. 
<s>  oh! great! so how much does it pay?  
< 
<chandler> hey joe! how's the second draft of the letter coming? 
<joey> great, i'm finished! in fact, i just dropped it off at the agency.  
<monica> you dropped it off? 
<joey> yeah. 
<chandler> can we read it? can you print out another copy? 
<joey> no can do amigo. no, i didn't use the computer. felt more personal to hand-write it.  
<monica> you hand-wrote it? 
<joey> yeah, and don't worry. i didn't try to sound smart at all! see ya later!  
<monica> oh my god, oh my god, that letter is gonna go in our file! we're never gonna get a kid. no, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!

<monica> okay good.

<monica> ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? you know what? just tell me on the way to the bird store. 
<chandler>  they loved it. 
<monica> what? 
<chandler> they thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter. 
<monica>  they thought joey was a child? 
<chandler> she guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.  
<s> hi! 
<monica> hey, what did you guys do today? 
<s> ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi. 
<chandler> that sounds like fun.

<s> i'm fine! and, i got you a present for letting me stay with you. ready? 
<rachel>  yeah!  
<s> ta-daaa!

<s>  doesn't it make her nose look smaller?  commercial break 
<rachel> you pierced her ears? how could you do this without telling me? 
<s> well, if i had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would it? 
<chandler> i think she looks cute.  ... but i am wrong! 
<rachel> oh my god, oh my god, here comes ross. he's gonna flip out. 
<s> why, did something happen to his falafel cart? 
<rachel> ugh.   
<ross> hey guys. 
<ross> hey emma. oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? she can barely see. . 
<rachel> nah, i don't really want her to see. 
<ross> why not? 
<monica> because there are so many terrible sights in this world. 
<chandler> like war. or that thing in joey's refrigerator. remember? it was in a milk carton but it looked like meat? 
<ross> come here  oh! there she is! hi!  
<ross>  what? 
<rachel> nothing. 
<ross>  hi!  what... . please tell me those are clip-ons. 
<rachel> oh, they're real!

<rachel> i know, i know, and you were right ross.  you are soo irresponsible i am never letting you baby-sit ever again! 
<s> hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? she needs to have a cool fun aunt! 
<monica> i'm a cool, fun aunt! 
<s>  o-okay! 
<chandler> hey! monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects! 
<rachel> i can't believe this. all i wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me? 
<s> well, i don't need you to help me, because i already know what i'm going to do with my life. 
<rachel> oh yeah? since when? 
<s> since today... i am going to be a baby stylist. 
<rachel>  what? 
<ross> that's not a thing!

<phoebe> but really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use? 
<s> are you serious? 
<phoebe> yeah! now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at city hall? 
<s> i think it would make me wanna marry you even more.  
<ross> i've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture! 
<chandler>  maybe you do that next time you get married! 
<ross> no, no, no. the next time it's gonna be a hawaii at sunset.  but maybe the time after that! opening credits

<joey> hey! 
<chandler> hey! 
<joey> what's going on? 
<chandler> our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment. 
<monica>  we? 
<chandler> you know you don't want me to help. you can't have it both ways! 
<joey> hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby? 
<chandler> kind of. she's coming by to interview us and see where we live. 
<monica> and it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state. 
<joey> hey, maybe i should stop by! she could be a soap opera fan! it's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity. 
<chandler>  little people? 
<joey>  celebrity. 
<monica> ok, so i think i'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes? 
<chandler> what...? no! 
<monica> chandler? 
<chandler>  i don't, and i'm offended by the insinuation! 
<monica> ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the vcr? 
<chandler> i'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine. 
<monica> it isn't mine! 
<joey>  well, i guess we'll never know whose it is! 
< 
<phoebe> yes. we're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children. is always appreciated. 
<phoebe> well, i think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one

<s> completely anonymous. from two kind strangers. 
<phoebe> mr. x and phoebe buffay. names in our newsletter.

<ross>  hi! 
<rachel> hi! emma will be up in a minute! 
<ross> oh, good! 
<rachel> oh hey ross... listen, i heard about you and charlie. i'm really sorry. 
<ross> oh, that's ok. i'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there. 
<rachel> absolutely. 
<ross> there was one! she's it! all the rest look like they should live under a bridge! 
<rachel> so, uhm... what are you gonna do today? 
<ross> well, i was thinking of taking emma to the playground! 
<rachel> oh my god, what!? 
<ross> like i said i was thinking of taking emma to the museum of knives and fire! 
<rachel> ok, look, ross. i do not want emma going to the playground. 
<ross> be-caaauuuse... 
<rachel>  all right, well, if you must know... i had a traumatic... swing incident... when i was little. 
<ross> seriously? 
<rachel> yes, i was 4 years old and i was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. and to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair!  and it was uneven for weeks! 
<ross>  and you made it through that? i wonder who's gonna play you in the movie! 
<rachel> ok, fine! you can make fun of me. i do not want emma going there. and i was thinking claire danes. 
<ross> look, i'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? but the swings are perfectly safe, and besides emma loves them. you know what, you should come with us and you'll see! 
<rachel> ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! ok? when you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth! 
<ross> space is filled with orbiting children.  look, please, just come on, you know, when you’ll see the look on emma’s face, i swear you won’t regret it. 
<rachel> all right! 
<ross> good, you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you? 
<rachel> irrational, huh? all right, well, i’ll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment! 
<ross> oh, yeah, that’s the same, i am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings! 
< 
<monica> oh my god, the adoption lady is early! 
<chandler> ok, ok, here we go. 
<monica> ok. 
<chandler> here we go. stand up straight.  big smile.  
<phoebe> hello, is this the creepy residence? 
<monica> we’re waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, i’m glad you’re here. i was cleaning this morning and i found this . i don’t know if you wanna use it, but… 
<phoebe> awe, this is so sweet of you! but you know what? i won’t be needing a veil, i actually won’t be wearing a dress at all! 
<monica> i told you! i am not coming to a naked wedding! 
<phoebe> no, no, no, we’re not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity. 
<monica> that’s crazy! . i am sorry. i just can’t imagine giving up my one wedding day like that! 
<phoebe> we, you know, we’re different! we don’t care about having a huge party.  this is really nice for you, but, oh, please, i put this on?  and, ow, i look , why, well, radiant.  all right, well, who cares, i don’t need a pretty veil and a fancy dress. 
<monica> that’s right. you’re making a commitment and that’s the same, whether you do that at the plaza or, where are you gonna do it? 
<phoebe> city hall. 
<monica> ow!  oh, that sounds nice! i am just there for jury duty. they really spruce that place up! 
<phoebe> it’s ok, it’s ok. i made my decision. what i really want is a great big wedding  
<monica> yay! 
<chandler> but you already gave all your money to charity! 
<phoebe> well, i’ll just ask for it back! 
<chandler> i don’t think you can do that! 
<monica> why not! this is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids! 
<chandler> that’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption lady. 
< 
<rachel> ok, careful. 
<ross> ok. 
<rachel> careful, watch her hair. watch her hair!

<rachel> ok. oh god.  get the camera, it’s in the diaper bag. 
<ross> ok!  see? scared of swings, i bet you feel pretty silly  ow!

<s> we’re seriously asking for our money back? 
<phoebe> it’s for our wedding day! right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna have to start flirting. the same day? i don’t think that that’s ever happened before. 
<phoebe> the donation we made earlier, we k…, we w…, we want it back. 
<phoebe> yeah. see, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn’t want, but it turns out we do. donation to the children? 
<s> yeah! this feels really good. 
<phoebe> i am sorry. i am, but this wedding is just really important to me. their check from a drawer) besides it’s probably a good thing. we really would have been spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing… 
<phoebe> hey, that’s not fair! a person’s wedding is important! and especially to me! ok? i didn’t have a graduation party! and i didn’t go to prom. and i spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to “kill me” or whatever. so i deserve a real celebration and i am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it. 
<s> she could have been talking about either one of us.

<monica> ah, thank you. this building does have a wholesome family feel to it. 
<s> you know, i... i feel like i've been here before. are any other couples in the building adopting? 
<monica> is that that couple on the first floor? because we should get a baby before them. yeah! that guy tried to sell me drugs.  
<chandler> but other than that... wholesome, wholesome building. 
<s> oh... 
<chandler> what? 
<s> i just realized why i remember this place. 
<monica> really? what is it? 
<s> oh, it's nothing. i went on a date with a guy who lived in this building and it didn't end very well. 
<monica> ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... joey tribbiani? 
<s> yes! 
<chandler> of course it was!

<rachel> ross, c'mon, please. can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets hurt? 
<ross> no wait, okay, okay, i have an idea. i want you to get on the swing, okay? and you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of. 
<rachel>  i know what this is all about... you've always been jealous of my hair. 
<ross> look, i just think you're an adult, okay? and you should get over your silly fears. 
<rachel> alright fine. i'll do it.

<[scene> monica and chandler's. they are preparing to show laura around. laura is standing with her back to the window, chandler and monica are standing on either side of her, facing each other. 
<s> well, i must say, this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child in. 
<monica> oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the furniture, because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there! 
<s> oh! well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure i have everything i need up to here...  
<monica>  why don't i show you the baby's room?  
<chandler> what the hell are you doing? 
<joey> well, you wouldn't let me in, so i thought you were in trouble. 
<chandler> well, we're not. 
<joey> but you called me 'bert'!? that's our code word for danger! 
<chandler> we don't have a code word. 
<joey> we don't? we really should. from now on, 'bert' will be our code word for danger.  
<monica> so that was the baby's room.  
<monica>  what room should we see next? 
<chandler> any room that isn't behind this couch!  
<monica>   some people don't get him, but i think he's really funny! .  
<joey>  i did not care for that! 
<chandler>  you have to get out of here. you slept with our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so she can't see you.

<ross> well...  whaa... aaah... aaahhh...  
<rachel> ross!   
< 
<monica> hey guys! 
<rachel> hi! 
<phoebe> hey! 
<monica> we need to talk to you about something. 
<chandler> yeah. we don't feel like we can host thanksgiving this year. 
<s> what? 
<phoebe> hey! 
<ross> are you kidding? 
<chandler> well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us. 
<ross>  that doesn't sound like you... that's monica talking! 
<chandler> no, no! we made this decision together. 
<ross> she's putting words in your mouth! 
<joey> don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths! 
<rachel> i can't believe this! this is emma's first thanksgiving! 
<monica> no, it's not! 
<rachel> it's not?  when was she born? 
<phoebe> well, personally i think it's great you're giving yourself a break. 
<monica> thank you, pheebs! 
<phoebe> sure. it's just as well... i mean, last year wasn't very good. i think she's losing her touch. 
<monica> what? you are way off, lady! 
<phoebe> am i? really? am i? well, why don't you cook thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. you'd be in competition... with yourself. 
<monica> that's my favourite kind! okay, we are doing this! 
<chandler> don't let yourself get manipulated this way! 
<monica> hey, stay out of this, chandler! this is between me... and me! 
<chandler> we are supposed to make these decisions together! did you not watch the doctor phil i taped for you? opening credits 
< 
<phoebe> hey! 
<rachel> hi! happy thanksgiving! 
<phoebe> oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day. 
<monica> you guys, i ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on bleecker. could you pick them up for me? 
<phoebe> you're not making the pies yourself? 
<monica> no, no, no, i don't make chocolate pies. when i was younger i-i enter in this pie-eating contest. i ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick. 
<rachel> did you at least win the contest? 
<monica> 2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! okay, i see you guys at 4. 
<rachel> can't wait! 
<monica> this dinner is gonna be so great! in your face, last year "me"!  
<phoebe> hey rach. 
<rachel> yeah. 
<phoebe> what's emma doing today? 
<rachel> well, let's see... uh... i know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. why? 
<phoebe> well, i wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant. 
<rachel> oh my god! that's the creepiest thing i've ever heard! 
<phoebe> okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend susanne is entering her kid and compared to emma she's a real dog! 
<rachel> oh! phoebe, all babies are beautiful! 
<phoebe>  oh... okay. 
<rachel> phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, i mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy... 
<rachel> and a thousand dollars. 
<rachel> ...is something i'm very interested in! oh please, do not tell ross. he still believes that  what's in the inside is important... 
<phoebe> okay, oh, and emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition. 
<rachel> where am i gonna get a cowgirl outfit on thanksgiving? 
<phoebe> well, i was thinking... 
<rachel> oh, take the clothes of joey's cabbage patch kid. 
<phoebe> yeah! 
< 
<monica>  did someone drop the baton again? 
<chandler> why come all the way from kansas to do that? 
<monica>  i don't get older. i just get better! 
<chandler> you know what just occurred to me? this could be our last thanksgiving just the two of us. i mean, we could be getting a baby soon! 
<monica> you don't know that. 
<chandler> somebody is gonna pick us. 
<monica> yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks! 
<chandler> i'm telling ya! it's gonna happen. next year it's gonna be you, me and the little hemingway bing.  what, he's my favourite author! 
<monica> name one of his books. 
<chandler>  "the firm"? 
<monica> ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready... 
<chandler> you know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. let me help this year. 
<monica> oh, chandler, that's sweet. but you don't have to do everything doctor phil tells you to do. 
<chandler> i'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "high profile". 
<monica> ok, let's see... oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it. 
<chandler> tell me more. 
<monica> okay, i'm gonna go check on something across the hall. you start by washing these  not with soap!!  
<chandler> you obviously haven't tasted my palmolive potatoes!  
<ross> hey! hey, guess what joey has! 
<joey> three tickets to today's rangers game!! 
<ross> dude, i wanted him to guess. 
<joey> oh. 
<chandler> oh my god! 
<joey> yeah, they're great seats too! 
<ross> guess where they are? 
<joey> center ice. 
<ross> did i do something to you? 
<chandler> hmm, the game's at one. 
<ross> so? 
<chandler> dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back. 
<joey> so we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time. 
<chandler> you say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. plus joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up. 
<joey> dude, two times that happened! 
<chandler> look, monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go! 
<ross> he's right, man. 
<joey> right, i guess. alright, so see you at four. 
<chandler> okay.  and get ready to taste my very special cranberries. or should i say... chanberries! 
<joey> that's some gentle comedy, dude.  
<ross> we're still going at the game, right? 
<joey> yeah! 
<ross> yeah.

<phoebe> we can't leave now! there was this one baby, haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! this competition just blew wide open, folks! 
<rachel> phoebe, i think... it's just too weird, i just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on! 
<phoebe> oh, i know, we should have been more prepared.  it's okay. now, the way i see it, our real competition now is cameron. oh my god, they just took her sweater off. look at those arms! hello michelin man. 
<rachel> oh, phoebe! come on! you know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to emma's group yet. we gotta go, we got dinner!

<rachel> phoebe, you have to calm down. 
<phoebe> okay. rachel, the hottest babies in the tri-state area are in this room right now! i overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to emma! 
<rachel> really?

<ross> yeah, i'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away. 
<joey> ohhhh! these seats are great!

<phoebe> we're just... we're trying to figure out an told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. that way we're right on time!  or... or, we can plant pcp in the apartment and call the cops on her. 
<ross>  that would be a good way to get rid of all the pcp we have lying around. 
<rachel> you know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. we'll just act casual. we're not late, we're right on time.  
<ross>  we know you're out there.  
<joey>  who do you think its from? 
<rachel> oh, god. this is bad. this is so bad. 
<ross> well, let's just go in there and face them. 
<phoebe> well, i'm not going in first. i bet that vein on monica's forehead is popping like crazy. 
<joey> i hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning. 
<rachel> oh, hey, i have an idea. why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first.  ready? . 
<joey>  ah-haah! i win!!

<rachel> you guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. we're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey.

<ross> how are we gonna decide who gets this? 
<joey>  water balloon!  
<phoebe> what are we gonna do? i'm starving.

<monica> hey, you touch that and you will be sorry. 
<chandler> guys, i'd listen to her. the vein is bigger than i've ever seen it.    
<rachel> huh... oh my god it's brussels sprouts.

<chandler> ha-ha! all you got was monica's stinky brussels sprouts! 
<monica> stinky?! 
<chandler> please let me stay on this side of the door.  
<rachel> oh, i know... i still have my old key!  we can just unlock the door. 
<phoebe> well, i don't know if that's such a good idea. they clearly don't want to be with us. 
<rachel> you know what? i don't want to be with them either, but it's thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together.  
<joey>  just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? look them in the eye. i know i can get them to forgive us. 
<ross> i don't know... 
<joey> i'm telling ya...  i can do it. 
<ross>  yeah, he can do it!  
<rachel> oh!   
<joey> oh! it all looks so beautiful stuffing...  
<chandler> the cranberries...? 
<monica> oh! enough! a monkey could have made 'em!

<joey> come on you guys, we want you to know we're  very very sorry.  right guys?  
<ross> i feel terrible. 
<joey>  now let's not ruin this day. you worked so hard. let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?

<monica> yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad. 
<rachel> so bad. 
<phoebe> so bad. 
<monica>  okay, okay. you two  go get the dessert. and i'll let you in.

<monica> grand supreme little darling? 
<rachel> congratulatioooons!

<ross> really girls, not cool. 
<chandler> well, you manheads aren't any better. you lied about going to the game. you knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway. 
<joey> hey! i'm getting a little tired of this okay? we said we're sorry. it's thanksgiving for pete's sakes! a day of forgiveness! 
<ross> it's a day to be thankful. 
<joey>  don't make me come up there! 
<monica> it's too late for apologies. 
<joey> fine! let's just go. i don't need your stupid dinner. 
<chandler> that would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling. 
<rachel> ewww, is that what that is? 
<joey> sorry! 
<phoebe> come on you guys, let's just do our own thanksgiving. 
<rachel> yeah! i'll cook!

<monica> the three of us? 
<joey> yeah! you, chan, and the vein!  
<joey> ha!  
<joey> oh-oh! i'm stuck! 
<monica> joey, that is not gonna work. 
<joey> no seriously... i'm really wedged in here. 
<phoebe> i'll pull you through. 
<ross> okay. 
<joey>  aaw-ahhh-aaahhh stop! stop! i'm worried about damaging my head. 
<chandler> a little late for that. 
<joey> alright, hurry up, you gotta do something. 
<monica> alright, well, this does not change anything.  okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face. 
<chandler> uhm, we've got turkey grease. 
<monica> bring it. 
<joey> i just wanna say that i'm sorry i referred to the vein as a seperate person...  
<monica> here you go!  
<joey> oh, that smells good!  
<joey> okay. 
<monica> okay, try it.  
<joey> it isn't working. 
<monica> alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain. 
<joey> well hurry, i can't feel my ears! 
<chandler> can you ever feel your ears? 
<joey> interesting... 
<monica> chandler, where are your tools? 
<chandler>  oh, i left them on my bulldozer... i don't have tools! 
<monica> i do, but rachel borrowed them. 
<rachel> i lent them to ross. 
<ross> i gave them to joey. 
<joey> i left them at the park. 
<monica> oh! 
<ross>  i'm finding it really hard not to mess with him. 
<phoebe> i've already stuffed a bunch of brussel sprouts down his pants. 
<ross> nice!  
<monica> okay, i have to get that. now when i get back, i want you and your friends to be gone. thanksgiving is over. the vein has spoken. 
<joey> it's really starting to hurt. 
<chandler> okay, look, i'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? okay, so push! 
<phoebe> just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here.  
<joey> ooh! stop putting things down my pants! 
<chandler> come on guys, push! 
<joey> yeah! come on!  
<chandler> my cranberries! 
<joey>  man, i've got food all over me.  
<chandler> argh! i can't believe what you did. monica's gonna kill you!  
<chandler>  look! look! look what the... look what... look what the floating heads did! 
<monica>  i don't care.  
<chandler> what's going on? 
<monica> that was the adoption agency... 
<chandler> and? 
<monica> we're getting a baby! 
<chandler> are you serious?  
<monica> there's a pregnant woman in ohio, and she picked us!  
<rachel> i'm so happy for you! 
<monica> this thanksgiving kicks last thanksgiving's ass!  commercial break 
< 
<rachel> to monica and chandler... and that knocked up girl in ohio. 
<ross> i'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid. 
<phoebe> i know. have you considered pageanting? 
<monica> i can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby.  
<joey> oh, i know how you feel...  
<rachel> really? 
<joey> sure. i went through the exact same thing with alicia mae emory... the waiting, the wandering... then one day... i get that call from toys "r" us... she was in stock! 
<chandler> that is the exact same thing.  
< 
<chandler> hi! 
<ross> hey! 
<monica> hey! 
<chandler> we're just here to say goodbye, we're off to ohio. 
<phoebe> oh, right! your adoption interview! 
<monica> yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby. 
<joey> i can't believe it. when you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! that is so weird! 
<chandler> and so incorrect! 
<monica> she's only a couple of months pregnant. she liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us. 
<ross> come on, she's gonna love you guys! 
<chandler> uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up. 
<monica> and a lot could still get in our way. 
<chandler> yeah. i mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better.. 
<phoebe> what are you gonna name the baby? 
<chandler> i can develop a condition in which i talk and talk and no one hears a word. 
<joey> but just think, ok? what if everything goes right? what if this woman does pick you guys? 
<monica> oh my god. she's gonna pick us! 
<chandler> so we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'? 
<monica> you know, i know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? if this works out, we're gonna have a baby chandler, a baby! 
<chandler> yes, but... 
<monica> oh my god, it's gonna work! we're gonna make it work! i'm gonna be a mummy and  you're gonna be a daddy! all right, i'll see you suckers. i'm gonna get me... a baby!  
<chandler> oh, screw it, i'm gonna be a daddy!! opening credits

<phoebe> mandy. 
<joey> mandy, uh? uh... really hot blonde, big boobs? 
<phoebe> no.

<rachel> do you think i'm someone else? 
<joey> ok, i may not have treated your friends well in the past, but i have grown up a lot, really. honest, rach? 
<rachel> well, believe it or not, it's true. when joey and i were together, he was wonderful. he was thoughtful and mature. and for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!

<ross> c'mon! this looks good! 
<rachel> ross, please, trust me. i buy 30 fashion magazines a month. now, i don't know who's running for president or who that... nato guy is, but i do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat. 
<ross> damnit! i have this date tomorrow night and i have to look cool! 
<phoebe> well, you know, if you want fashion help, rachel and i are going shopping tomorrow. you're more than welcome to come with us, right? 
<ross> really? that would be great. i mean, i have to do something, she kinda teased me about how i dress. 
<joey> i can see why, nice shirt! 
<ross> you're wearing the same shirt. 
<joey> stupid gap on every corner! 
< will back in a moment with erica. 
<monica> ok, thank you. uh, well this is it. are you ok? 
<chandler> yeah. just weird, you know. it's like i'm chandler. may i have the human growing inside you?" 
<monica> uh, we're gonna be great. 
<chandler> you're gonna be great. 
<monica> well... obviously! i'd like you to meet erica. 
<monica> hi. it is so, so nice to meet you. 
<s>  hi... 
<chandler> thank you so much for agreeing to see us. 
<s> hi. 
<chandler> ok. 
<s> so, it's monica and chandler. i only know you as file 0w33815-d. 
<chandler> that's what our friends call us. 
<s> gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. it's... kind of intimidating. 
<monica> i don't know about that. 
<s> you're kidding me? i mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. but on top of it, you're married to a reverend? 
<chandler>  i don't think that's exactly... 
<monica>  let her finish, doctor. 
< 
<phoebe> hey! 
<joey> hey. 
<phoebe> oh, my friend sarah had a great time last night. 
<joey> well... 
<phoebe> yeah! so you're gonna call this one back? 
<joey> nope. 
<phoebe> what are you talking about? sarah's great! 
<joey> oh, really? you know what your great friend did? we're out to dinner, ok?  we're getting along, having a really nice time. i was thinking she was really cool. and then, out of nowhere...  
<phoebe> that’s it? that’s why you won’t go out with her again? so, she took some fries, big deal! 
<joey> hey, hey, look! it’s not about a few fries... it’s about what the fries represent. 
<phoebe> what? 
<joey> all food! 
<phoebe> i’m sorry, i can’t believe i set you up with such a monster! 
<joey> hey, hey, hey, hey. look. i take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! the more, the better! all right? just don’t order a garden salad and then eat my food! that’s a good way to lose some fingers!  
<phoebe>  oh 
<rachel> hi 
<phoebe> thank god you’re here. listen to this! 
<rachel> what? 
<phoebe> joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries... 
<rachel> oh! oh, no!  
<phoebe> what? you know about the plate thing? 
<rachel> oh, yeah. joey doesn’t share food. i mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ... 
<phoebe>  you wouldn’t let her have a grape? 
<rachel> oh no! not me! emma!  
<joey>  joey doesn’t share food! 
<phoebe> well, i still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. you are calling her! and if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table! 
<joey>  i like that! a sharing buffer! yeah! i’ll order some extra fries! maybe a plate of onion rings. yeah. and a shrimp cocktail. and some buffalo wings. maybe an individual pizza, uh? and some mozzarella sticks.  what were we talking about? 
< 
<phoebe>  this place is awesome! 
<ross> you know, we should just go, i’m not gonna find anything here! this stuff is ridiculous!  
<rachel> ah, this place is great! 
<phoebe> wow! 
<ross> rach, come on, i’m not gonna wear any of this!  nothing silver. . ok? nothing with hair!  and nothing with padlocks on it! . 
<rachel> ross, look, i know that some of this stuff is out there, but i mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . i mean, this is just beautiful! 
<ross>  wow, this is really soft . three hundred and fifty dollars? 
<rachel> yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks! 
<ross> both logic and math are taking a serious hit today. 
<phoebe>  hey, check this out! it’s totally you! 
<ross> wow! 
<phoebe> yeah!  
<ross> actually this looks like pretty good! yeah! boys will be boys? 
<phoebe> what? they will be! 
<ross> all right, that’s it, i’m getting out of here. 
<rachel> no, no, no, no! ross, wait! come on! you know, there’s other stuff. here’s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants... 
<ross> uh, actually these might look pretty good on me. 
<rachel> yes, they will! you know what you should do? just go take a walk, all right? i know your size and i’m... i’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you. 
<ross> really? 
<rachel> yes! and i know what looks sexy on guys. please, just wear what i suggest, and she’s gonna go nuts for you. 
<ross> so, you’re saying, uh, if i wear these pants i might be getting into hers? 
<rachel>  why do men keep talking to me like this? 
< 
<chandler> so, the fact that i am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you? 
<s> yeah, i read some great applications, but then i thought “who better then a minister to raise a child!” 
<monica> amen. 
<chandler> plus i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor! 
<monica> uh, good hands.  healing hands. 
<s> reverend, can i ask? does the bible say anything about adoption? 
<monica> it says "do it!" and behold she did adopt unto them a baby. and it was good. 
<s> wow. 
<chandler> yeah, wow. 
<s> i was wondering you both have such serious jobs.  would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock? 
<monica> oh, you know, my flock is good, i mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. good flock. flock, flock, flock. 
<s>  being a doctor must take up a lot of time. 
<chandler> not for me it doesn’t.  
<s> we’re great, i think i may have asked all my questions. 
<chandler> yeah, actually. so, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us? we’re very proud of it. 
<chandler> you should be. you’re really on top of stuff.. nothing else, then the two of us should talk. 
<s> actually, i don’t think we have to. 
<monica> we don’t? 
<s> yeah, when i read about you two, i was pretty sure i wanted you, but i just thought we should meet face to face. . i've made my decision. i choose them. 
<monica> oh my god, this is great! this is so great! . did you hear that? 
<chandler> yeah, i did. 
<monica>  hey, thank you. thank you so much. . you are so going to heaven! 
< 
<rachel> we got some really great stuff! 
<phoebe> yeah, yeah but i am not sure about some of the bra's i got. 
<rachel> oh! really? do you wanna try some of them on for me? 
<phoebe> oh! okay. wait, are we in joey's imagination? 
<rachel>  oh no! i took one of ross' bags by mistake, and one of mine is missing. 
<phoebe> oh, well, ross probably has it, you can get it from him later. 
< 
<ross>  so? what do you think?  
<joey> i think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!! 
<ross>  yeah! yeah! rachel picked it out for me. she told me to trust her and you know what? i'm glad i did! i turned quite a few heads on my way over here. 
<joey>  dude, i really don't think you should be wearing that. 
<ross> oh, i see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies? 
<joey>  looks like someone is the ladies!! 
<ross> you're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. yeah, now if you'll excuse me  i have a date.  see?  all eyes on me! 
< 
<chandler> we are not signing those papers. 
<monica> why not? 
<chandler> it's wrong. they made a mistake. they think we're somebody else. 
<monica> god works in mysterious ways. 
<chandler> you have gotta stop! 
<monica> but she liked us. 
<chandler> she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica. 
<monica> well, if you think about it, i am kind of like a reverend. i mean, as a chef, i serve god, by feeing the hungry and poor.  
<chandler> your veal chop is $34.95! 
<monica> c'mon chandler, i think we have been given an opportunity. i mean, the mistake has already been made. they are writing up the paper right now. 
<chandler> but we are not the one she chose! how can you feel okay about this? 
<monica>  because... we may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us. 
<chandler> i know.. 
<monica> i mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? what if, what if no one ever picks us? 
<chandler> oh, honey.. 
<monica>  please.. please, we are so close. 
<chandler> monica, i want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. she deserves to know who it's going to. 
<monica>  okay, right.  
<chandler> so, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us. 
<monica>  maybe she will. uh! why couldn't i have been a reverend? 
<chandler> you're jewish. 
<monica> technicality! 
< 
<s> a garden salad for the lady  
<joey> oh, that looks great! good ordering! 
<s> seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. enjoy! 
<s> mmmh, those fries look delicious. 
<joey> oh, i didn't know you liked french fries. help yourself! what's mine is yours.  
<s>  oh wow, are those stuffed clams? 
<joey> uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.  
<joey> how about those fries though, huh?  
<s> they are delicious  
<joey>  you are beautiful, you know that? 
<s> oh, that is so sweet.. 
<joey> oh  okay..   
<joey>  now look what you did!! 
<s> what? what is the matter with you? 
<joey> i don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay? 
<s> but you just said "what's mine is yours"?

<s> hi! 
<chandler> hey. an open adoption. there's a lot to go over, but i'll explain everything as we go through it. 
<monica>  i-is... is that a picture? 
<s> yeah. it's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. i thought you might want to see it.  
<monica> look, doctor!  look, before we sign anything we really have to talk... we're not who you think we are. 
<chandler> the agency must have made some mistake. my wife is not a reverend and i'm not a doctor. 
<s> what? 
<chandler> i could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like. 
<s> so who are you? 
<chandler> well, our names really are monica and chandler. we're from new york. 
<monica> yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby.  
<s> so you lied to me before? 
<monica> well, we...  "bore false witness"... see i could be a reverend. 
<s> i can't believe this. 
<monica> but we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider... 
<s> giving you my baby? you think i'd give you my child after this? 
<monica> well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file... 
<s> i don't want to look at your file! this is over.  
<chandler> erica wait! 
<s> i've nothing to say to you.  
<chandler> you have every reason to be upset. we did lie. but only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again. 
<s> why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it? 
<chandler> erica, please. just consider us. ask them to see our file. our last name's bing. my wife's a chef and i'm in advertising. 
<s> oh yeah. i actually liked you guys. but it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong.  
<chandler> but you did like us. and you should. my wife's an incredible woman. she's loving and devoted and caring. and don't tell her i said this but the woman's always right... i love my wife more than anything in this world. and i... it kills me that i can't give her a baby... i really want a kid. and when that day finally comes, i'll learn how to be a good dad. but my wife... she's already there. she's a mother... without a baby... please?  
<chandler> you still want that baby?  
<monica> god bless you chandler bing! commercial break

<chandler>  it's like a giant hug.

<phoebe> oh! he's having an affair. 
<rachel> he's not having an affair! 
<phoebe> you know, i'm always right about these things. 
<rachel> no, you're not! last week you thought ross was trying to kill you! 
<phoebe> well, i'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it!  see, there's something going on with them. look, he's getting into the car with her! 
<rachel> oh, that doesn't mean anything. 
<phoebe> oh yeah? well, let's see.  ok, duck down.  
<chandler>  hello. 
<phoebe> oh, hi chandler. it's phoebe. uhm... i know that monica is working today so... ...i was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and rachel. 
<chandler> oh, uhm... i have to work too. yeah, i'm stuck at the office all day. 
<phoebe>  oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either "liar, liar" or "betrayal", or... "an affair to remember". 
<chandler> those are all really old! 
<phoebe> ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm... 
<rachel>  "dude, where's my car?" 
<phoebe>  what? 
<rachel> they're in a caaar... 
<phoebe>  okay, we-we'll talk to you later. okay, bye. 
<rachel> geez! 
<phoebe> ok. quick. we gotta find a cab and follow them. 
<rachel> oh, yeah, ok. let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun. 
<phoebe>  i got them! 
< 
<chandler> hi! 
<monica> hey! you smell like perfume and cigarettes. 
<chandler> i was in the car with nancy all day. 
<monica> nancy doesn’t smoke! 
<chandler> well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that! 
<monica> so? what do you think of the house? 
<chandler> it’s perfect. it’s everything we’ve been looking for. 
<monica> isn’t it? then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic? 
<chandler> and the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps?  what were the things you said? 
<monica> don’t you love the huge yard? 
<chandler> and the fireplace in the bedroom. 
<monica> and nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents! 
<chandler> this is bringing out a lovely color in you! 
<monica> so? do you think we should get it? 
<chandler> i don’t know. what do you think? 
<monica> i think we should. 
<chandler> i do too. 
<monica> this is huge! 
<chandler> i know. 
<monica> how bad you wanna smoke, right now. 
<chandler> i don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! oh, by the way, phoebe called just as i was getting into nancy’s car, so if she asks you, i was at work all day. 
<monica> gotcha. when do we tell them about this? 
<chandler> we don’t. not until it's a hundred percent. i mean, why upset everybody over nothing. 
<monica> okay. right. oh my god that is gonna be so hard. 
<chandler> i know. gooooood luck with it. 
< 
<ross> i just can’t see chandler cheating! 
<rachel> i’m telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy! 
<joey> chandler? forty-five minutes? well, something is not right. i just can’t believe he would do this to monica! 
<ross> i know, and with the baby coming? 
<phoebe> so, should we tell her? 
<ross> i don’t know. phoebe, if one of us saw mike with another woman would you want us to tell you? 
<phoebe> why? who’d you seen him with? 
<ross> no one, i’m just saying if...  
<phoebe> tell me what you know! 
<ross>  i know nothing! mike’s a great guy, it was hypothetical! 
<phoebe> all right. . he is a good guy. you’re right, he wouldn’t cheat. 
<ross> believe me, if i did see with someone, there’s no way i...  
< 
<rachel> oh, look at her, so happy! 
<monica> if only there were a smaller one to clean this one! 
<joey> hey, is uhm... is chandler here? 
<monica> no, he’s picking up dinner, why, what’s up? 
<phoebe> well, look, whatever happens, we’re here for you and we love you. 
<ross> we think chandler might be having an affair. 
<monica> what? 
<rachel> phoebe and i saw chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in westchester. 
<phoebe> they went in together. so sorry. 
<monica> oh my god! oh my god that’s awful! what did you think of the house?  
<phoebe> what? 
<joey>  monica, you understand what we are saying, right? 
<monica> yeah, sure... uhm, i'm devastated, obviously...  did you think the neighborhood was homey?  
<chandler> hey! 
<joey>  you son of a bitch! 
<chandler> is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here? 
<monica>  phoebe and rachel saw you with nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair. 
<rachel> who's nancy? 
<ross> what's going on? 
<monica>  ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big. 
<chandler> yeah  i'm not having an affair. nancy is our realtor. 
<joey> i knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!! 
<phoebe> why do you have a realtor? 
<monica> uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city. 
<joey>  what? 
<rachel> are you serious? 
<monica> when we found out that we're gonna get this baby, chandler and i started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city. 
<phoebe> so you're gonna move? 
<ross> oh my god. 
<joey> shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?! 
<rachel> what is wrong with raising a kid in the city? i'm doing it, ross is doing it, sarah jessica parker is doing it! 
<monica> and that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset... 
<chandler> ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by. 
<ross>  so you wanna buy a house in the 50's? 
<phoebe> have you thought about what you would be giving up? you can't move out of the city, what if you want chinese food at 5am? or a fake rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an asian hooker sent right to your door? 
<ross> you know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay. 
<joey> no, no, it's not, don't listen to him!  i'm gonna thump you!  
<ross>  it's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.  
<chandler> actually, we already found a house we love. 
<ross> what? 
<monica> and about an hour ago, we made an offer.  
<chandler> bet you wish i was having an affair now, huh? time lapse 
<ross> you put an offer on a house? 
<monica>  it's so sweet. it really is. it has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees...  
<phoebe> wha..? again with the nature, what are you? beavers? 
<chandler> i know this is really hard and we're really sorry. 
<joey> is this because i come over here without knocking and eat your food?  because i can stop doing that,  i really, really think i can! 
<chandler>  you know that's not the reason joe.  
<monica> we think if you saw it, you'd understand. i mean you guys were there.  it is beautiful, isn't it? 
<rachel> yeah it is. 
<joey> what the hell are you doin'? 
<rachel> well, it is, all right? when we were out there is screwing this woman, but man this would be a nice place to live! 
<phoebe> yeah, but so is this. 
<ross> yeah, i mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. i mean, how can you leave this place?   
<rachel>  c'mon daddy, listen to me! all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'you're a shoe! you're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. and today i just stopped and i said, 'what if i don't wanna be a shoe? what if i wanna be a- a purse, y'know? or a- or a hat! no, i don't want you to buy me a hat, i'm saying that i am a ha- it's a metaphor, daddy! 
<ross> you can see where he'd have trouble. 
<rachel> well maybe i'll just stay here with monica. 
<monica> well, i guess we've established who's staying here with monica...  
<ross> that money is mine, green! 
<rachel> you're fly is open, geller! 
<phoebe> you guys, you know what i just realized? 'joker' is 'poker' with a 'j.' coincidence? 
<chandler> hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'c'!  
<phoebe>  eww, look. ugly naked guy lit a bunch of candles.  
<rachel> ow, that had to hurt!  
<phoebe> hey, it’s your thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help. 
<s> we will.  
<monica> okay, rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles. 
<rachel> no mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. i want to do this.  
<monica> every year.  
<joey>  it's stuck!!! 
<phoebe>  easy. step. how did it get on? 
<joey> i put it on to scare chandler! 
<phoebe> oh my god! monica's gonna totally freak out! 
<joey> it smells really bad in here. 
<phoebe> well, of course it smells really bad. you have your head inside a turkey's ass!  
<monica> hey, did you get the turkey bast-oh my god! oh my god!  who is that? 
<joey> it's joey.  
<monica> i got it! how about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster? 
<rachel> oooohh that’s interesting.

<joey>  dah!!  
<chandler> but if we win, we get your apartment. 
<joey> oooooh! 
<monica> deal! time lapse 
<ross> what was monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?

<monica> nooooooooo!!!!! time lapse  
<rachel> y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean! 
<joey> hey, don’t get mad at us! no one forced you to raise the stakes! 
<rachel> that is not true. she did! she forced me! 
<monica> hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong! 
<rachel> well it stupid, unfair question! 
<ross> don’t blame the questions! 
<chandler> would you all stop yelling in our apartment! you are ruining moving day for us!  
<ross> chandler!!! chandler!!!  chandler, i saw what you were doing through the window! chandler, i saw what you were doing to my sister! now get out here! 
<chandler>  wow! listen, we had a good run. you know, what was it? four? five months? i mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! so, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!  
<monica>  hey ross. what's up bro?  
<ross> what the hell are doing?!! 
<rachel>  hey, what's-what's going on?! 
<chandler> well, i think, i think ross knows about me and monica. 
<joey>  dude! he's right there! 
<ross>  i thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! my best friend and my sister! i-i cannot believe this! 
<chandler> look, we're not just messing around! i love her. okay, i'm in love with her. 
<monica> i'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. i'm sorry, but iit-t's true, i love him too.  
<ross>  my best friend and my sister! i cannot believe this.   
<monica> well, this is the last box of your clothes. i’m just gonna label it, "what were you thinking?" 
<rachel> funny, because i was just gonna go across the hall and write that on chandler. 
<phoebe> ok, you guys, i don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, i don’t want to live with rachel anymore. 
<phoebe> you’re just so mean to each other! and i don’t want to end up like that with rachel. i still like you! 
<rachel> well, phoebe that’s fine because i’m not moving. 
<monica> whoa-whoa-whoa, phoebe you gotta take her! y’know, i-i-i said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. she gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that i’d like. 
<phoebe> what else? 
<monica> when i take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror. 
<rachel> yeah, i do. i-i do, do that. 
<phoebe> that’s nice. i like having things to read in the bathroom. 
<monica> when i fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket. 
<rachel> well y’know, i don’t want you to be cold. 
<monica> and when i told her that i was gonna be moving in with chandler, she was really supportive.   you were so great. you made it so easy. and now you have to leave. and i have to live with a boy!!  time lapse  
<chandler>  hey. 
<monica> she really left. 
<chandler> i know.  
<monica> thank you. 
<chandler> no problem roomie.  
<monica> can i ask you a question? 
<chandler> sure! 
<monica> what the hell is that dog doing here?!   
<chandler> little toast here. i know this isn't exactly the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, i think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. anyway, i was just thinking, i mean, if you'd gone to vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? so i guess what i'm trying to say is that i'm very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked. 
<s> that's so sweet. 
<ross> and hey, here's to a lousy christmas. 
<rachel> and a crappy new year. 
<chandler> here, here!

<phoebe> yeah, you don't wanna live in westchester. that's like the worst of the chesters. 
<ross> you know, sometimes when i'm alone in my apartment, i look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching tv or something, but... it makes me feel better. and now when i look over, who am i gonna see? the gottliebs, the yangs? they don't make me feel so good.  
<rachel> yeah. so don't move, okay? just stay here and...  maybe close your blinds at night.  
<chandler> hello? it's nancy, they responded to our offer. 
<monica> and?  
<chandler>  okay, thanks...  they passed. they said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price. 
<monica> we can't afford that. 
<chandler> i know. 
<monica> well, there you go.  
<joey> i'm really sorry you guys. 
<ross> yeah. i'm sorry too. i'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before i told you about looking through the window.

<chandler> all right, i'd say we make a pact. neither of us will go out with missy goldberg.

<ross> those are the pacts! 
<chandler> oh, and sheena easton. but we probably couldn't get her anyway.

<monica> what? when was this? 
<ross> nineteen eighty seven. the weekend you guys visited me at school. 
<monica> oh my god! that's wild! 
<chandler> yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter. 
<ross> well, it matters to me. 
<chandler> why? 
<ross> because... the night you kissed rachel was the night i kissed rachel for the very first time. 
<chandler> you kissed her that night too? 
<monica> two guys in one night? wow, i thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed. 
<chandler> seriously, where did this happen? 
<ross> okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, i went in there to make sure she was all right. she was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples' coats. well, i went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. but it was so dark, i accidentally got her lips. i started to pull away, but then i felt her start to kiss me back. it was only for a second, but... it was amazing. and now, now i find out that you kissed her first. 
<chandler> oh wait... what bed did you say she was on? 
<ross> mine. 
<chandler> i'm pretty sure i put her on my bed. 
<ross> no, she was definitely on my bed. 
<chandler> why would i kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed? 
<ross> well, then who was on my bed? 
<monica>  oh! oh, oh!  
<ross>  no! no, no! 
<monica> yes!  
<ross> you were under the pile of coats? 
<monica> i was the pile of coats! 
<ross> oh my god! 
<monica> you were my midnight mystery kisser?

<joey>  yeah. 
<phoebe> yeah. well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till monday. 
<joey> so he can't come? 
<phoebe> no, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, i would just really love it if you would do it. 
<joey> seriously? 
<phoebe> yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. i mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom... 
<joey> i am pretty wisdomous. 
<phoebe> so... what do you say? 
<joey> are you kidding? phoebe, i would be honored.  
<phoebe> oh, thank you. i hope... i hope you know how much you mean to me. 
<joey>  listen, i hope... that you know...  i don't want you to see your father cry, go to your room! opening credits

<monica> did you just hung up on me?  all right, look, i need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours. 
<phoebe> uh-uh. ok. what time is that. 
<monica> you don't know military time? 
<phoebe> why, i must have been in missile training the day they taught that.

<monica>  six o'clock! 
<phoebe> ok. 
<monica> ok. hold on.  geller here! no! i said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. goodbye.  oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture? 
<phoebe> ice sculpture? that sounds really fancy! i told you i just want a simple wedding. 
<monica> please... honey, leave the details to me. now i wanna make this day as special for you as i can. now, ok, i was thinking that the harpist should wear white. 
<phoebe> what harpist? my friend marjorie is playing the steel drums. 
<monica> ooh... she backed out. 
<phoebe> she did? why? 
<monica> i made her.  steel drums don't really say "elegant wedding". nor does marjorie's overwhelming scent. 
<phoebe>  hey! she will shower when tibet is free.

<chandler> hey! 
<phoebe> hey! 
<chandler> you look great. i'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, i so rarely get to practice my meals before i eat them.

<joey> hey, you're mike's parents, right?

<joey> hey, i'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? but i'm just trying to be nice for the kids!  
<chandler>  you know what i just realized? we have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow. 
<ross> yeah, i thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? when did they ask you to be their bridesmaid? 
<rachel> uh... november? 
<ross> i wanna say it's not looking good. 
<rachel> hey pheebs... 
<phoebe> what's up?

<monica> ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises! 
<ross> i can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding. 
<chandler> i know, i hate being left out of things. 
<ross> and it's a wedding! it'd be weird if i'm not in it... 
<s> hey guys, how is it going?

<chandler> oh, i will. but i will need a mirror... as he is me! 
<ross> please, you're going down! 
<chandler> you are going downer! 
<ross> is that what they say on the figure skating team?

<s> you're right. she probably will support me. hey, unless we move in with you, dad? 
<joey> strike three! you only get one more, mike!  
<ross> so, what did you decide? 
<phoebe> i decided to pee. 
<chandler> mike didn't tell you? you have to choose one of us to be in your wedding. one of his groomsmen fell out. 
<phoebe> oh no, no. i can't choose between you two! i love you both so much!

<joey> oh, man! i wouldn't have had breakfast if i knew there was going to be corsages!  
<monica> hi. about last night... i know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... my point is, uh, well, i'm willing to take my job back. 
<phoebe> oh, well that's ok. i think you and i will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid. 
<monica> oh, is that so? ok. if that's really what you want, then here... i give you the headset. well, i don't really want to give you the headset. well i guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages.  
<phoebe> wow, this is a lot! 
<monica> uh-huh, but i'm sure you can handle this. i mean, i have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, i'm sure you'll do fine. 
<phoebe> you won awards? 
<monica> mm-mh. i printed them out on my computer.  
<ross> hey! 
<monica> hi. 
<ross> where's rach? 
<monica> she's in her room, why? 
<ross> i have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? i'm not gonna watch chandler up there while i'm sitting in the seats like some chump! .  oh! my god! you're breathtaking! 
<rachel> what d'you want? 
<ross> you haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you? 
<rachel> oh, ross, c'mon, please! don't make this harder than it already is! 
<ross> i'm not! i'm making it easier! pick me! 
<rachel> well, chandler said that it's really important to him too! 
<ross> listen, listen. whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! now, i promise i won't say a word, but if you pick chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time! 
<rachel> oh, you are the lesser of two evils! 
<ross>  yes, yes! 
< 
<phoebe> sven i don't understand what you're saying! what is wrong with the flowers? lorkins? what the hell are lorkins? 
<monica> i know. . 
<s> hey. 
<phoebe> listen, mike, if you were swedish and you were saying the word "lorkins" what flowers would that be? 
<s>  orchids? 
<phoebe> right there! that's why i'm marrying you!  
<joey>  hello michael. 
<s> joseph. 
<joey> may i have a word with you, please? 
<s>  this is... great... 
<joey> have a seat.  last night, i tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me...  i cannot allow this. 
<s>  are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie? 
<joey> more back talk. and yes, i may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for "family 
<s> joey, i kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want? 
<joey> i want you to take this seriously! phoebe is very very important to me, ok? and i wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her. 
<s>  joe, i love phoebe. she's the single most important thing in my life. i'd die before i let anything happen to her. 
<joey>  that's what i wanted to hear! because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family. 
<s> that must have been one lousy movie. 
<joey>  that was me! 
< 
<rachel> hi 
<chandler> hey, can i talk to you about this groomsman thing? if you pick ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. but if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy! 
<rachel> even so, i think i'm gonna pick ross. 
<chandler> let me tell you why you need to pick me.  see, when i was a kid, i was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. you know, i was always picked last in gym. even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. i mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. anyway, if i'm the only one left out of this wedding, i just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back. 
<rachel> all right fine, i pick you. 
<chandler>  y-y-yeeesss! make "groom" for chandler. 
<rachel>  oh my... 
< 
<phoebe> no! we're gonna do it my way.  because your way is stupid! alright i gotta go, i have another call, reverend.  hello?  
<joey> i'm glad we had this little talk. 
<s> yes. yeah and thanks for all the wedding night advice.  that didn't make me uncomfortable at all! alright, so i'll see everybody tonight? 
<phoebe> okay. 
<monica> bye.  
<s> uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall? 
<phoebe> oh my god, what's it doing here? 
<monica>  ugh, i guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address.  uh! what a pickle. 
<phoebe>  oh my god, everything is such a mess. why is this happening to me? 
<joey>  how bad do you want to stick your tongue on that?  
< 
<chandler> how's it going? 
<ross>  good. i'm just getting some coffee. so i'm alert for the wedding. 
<chandler>  that's what i was doing too. 
<ross>  well, you have fun tonight. 
<chandler> you too. 
<ross> oh, i will. 
<chandler> me too.  
<ross> wait a minute, i know why i'm being such an ass, why are you? 
<chandler> i'm not supposed to tell you. 
<ross> i'm not supposed to tell you!  
<chandler> you told us both we could be in the wedding?  
<rachel> well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other. 
<ross> rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. you and me together again.  
<chandler> rach, rach, knock knock. 
<rachel> who's there? 
<chandler> i'll tell you at the wedding. 
<rachel> uh.  
<s> hey, i forgot my scarf. 
<rachel> you know what, i can't do this. i don't know which one of you guys to pick. 
<s> oh, you haven't picked yet. oh good, 'cause i had an idea. i thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. chappy. 
<ross> what? a dog? no! rachel gets to choose.  
<rachel>  wow, this is a tough one. i think i'm gonna have to go with the dog.   
<phoebe> alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the hamilton club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? are you, are you freaking kidding me!? 
<monica>  how's it going? 
<phoebe>  help me. 
<monica> what? 
<phoebe> i want you to be crazy bitch again. 
<monica>  really? 
<phoebe>  please? 
<monica> you really want me to come back? 
<phoebe> more than i wanna get married. 
<monica> ok people, we are back in business!  oh god, we've missed you soo much!  ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and i'll take care of everything.  
<joey> hey, what are you guys gonna do? 
<phoebe>  about what? 
<joey> the blizzard. i just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! they already closed all the bridges and tunnels.  
<monica> ooh! but the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from new jersey! 
<joey> i don't think they are. 
<ross>  haha! looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either.  so sorry pheebs. 
< 
<monica>  well, the club lost it's power. 
<joey> yeah according to the news, most of the city did. 
<rachel> since when do you watch the news? 
<joey> uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl. 
<ross>  i can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today. 
<phoebe> i know. 
<rachel> wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. you always wanted to get married outside. why don't you guys just do it on the street? 
<phoebe> what? 
<rachel> well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. i mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. this could be the simple wedding you've always wanted! 
<phoebe>  what do you think? 
<s> i think i wanna get married to you today. 
<phoebe> me too!  monica, do you think we could do it? 
<monica>  affirmative! 
< 
<monica>  ok let's get these chairs out here! gunther, hit the christmas lights.  okay, who left the ice sculpture  on the steam grate?  
<s> hey! you made it. great! chappy! hi!  hi!  mom, i know getting married in the street isn't something you approve of... i could look at them forever. and put it in her drink...  come on, sweetheart. 
<s>  you know, chappy's too small to handle all this snow. someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle. 
<chandler> so technically, would this person be in the wedding? 
<s> i guess. 
<ross> no, but chandler, hello... aren't you scared of dogs? 
<chandler> i'm not scared.  i'll just take little chappy and...  he can sense my fear. my throat is exposed. 
<ross>  well, i guess i'm in the wedding then. ha haaa...  he stinks! 
<monica> level 1 alert. i repeat, level 1. this is not a drill. okay we've got a situation. the minister just called. he's snowed in. he can't make it. 
<s> oh, no! 
<joey> oh hey, don't worry. i'm still ordained from your wedding. 
<monica> really? 
<joey> yeah, you'd think i'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? uhh-uh... 
<ross> uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free. 
<joey> i had to read the bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do. 
<monica> okay, if joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk phoebe down the isle. 
<chandler>  i'll do it. 
<ross> i'll... 
<chandler>  na ha ha...  ne he he...  ah ah... 
<monica> okay, mike and joey, get in position. chandler, come with me.   
<monica> okay, joey's doing the ceremony and chandler's giving you away. 
<phoebe> oh, okay. hi new dad.  
<monica> so, you're ready to do this? 
<phoebe> uhuh, uhuh... oh my god! this is really happening.

<joey>  okay... 
<phoebe> when i was growing up, i didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and i always knew that something was missing. but now i'm standing here today, knowing that i have everything i'm ever gonna need... you are my family.  
<s> phoebe you're so beautiful. you're so kind, you're so generous. you're so wonderfully weird. every day with you is an adventure, and i can't believe how lucky i am, and i can't wait to share my life with you forever.

<chandler> that's great. 
<s> yeah... it's almost definitely him.

<chandler> so, what does the other guy do? does he go to college too? 
<s> no, he's in prison.  
<monica> was he falsely accused of something?  
<s> no... he killed his father with a shovel.  but other than that, he's a great guy. 
<chandler> i'll bet his dad doesn't think so.  
<monica> are you awake? 
<chandler> of course i'm awake. assume from now on that i'm always awake!  
<monica> alright, we don't know that it's him. i mean, it could be the football guy. 
<chandler> honey, it's us. of course it's the shovel-killer. 
<monica> alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? no! would we treat him any differently? 
<chandler> i'd keep an eye on him! we have to find out which one the father is. 
<monica> how? 
<chandler> i dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right? 
<monica> yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting. 
<chandler> pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. he probably loves him mommy. he's probably got a tattoo that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm!

<ross>  wait, wait,  you're mad at me about last night? i was just trying to do the right thing. 
<rachel>  really? well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, i would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, i would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied! 
<ross>  well... 
<rachel> oh stop that! 
<ross> i can't believe this. i was just being a good guy. i treated you with respect and understanding. 
<rachel>  oh, that is so hot.

<rachel> oh, really, really? well, it wasn't very good for me either.  
<ross> hey you know what? you know what? to avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.

<ross> that's right, sex is off the table.  i am never having sex with you again.  dr._green, are you feeling better?  
< 
<chandler> hey! how was lunch? 
<s>  we had a good time. by the way, i wanted to ask you something. it would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, jiminy billy bob  
<chandler>  oh, really? 
<s> no!  you we're right, that was fun! i'm gonna go finish packing. 
<chandler> o-okay.  so, is she gonna take the test?

<chandler> oh god. it's shovely-joe, isn't it? 
<monica>  no it's not. 
<chandler> how do you know? 
<s> well, it turns out that erica didn't pay much attention in sex ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.

< 
<joey> i mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am i missing opportunities? you know, i've always thought of myself as a serious actor. i mean, should i be trying to do more independent movies? 
<s>  i don't know... you know what? i'm gonna put you on with my bear. hold on.  
<joey> hey bear, i need some career advice.  
<s> previously on friends... 
<chandler> how did the job stuff go? 
<rachel> he offered me one. 
<ross>  you know what? this calls for a bottle of israels finest. 
<rachel> the job is in paris.  fade out 
<rachel> oh, god! please, somebody say something. 
<ross> so if you take this job you'll be moving to paris? 
<chandler> or facing a bitch of a commute. 
<rachel> i know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. and i've already talked to them about our situation with emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable. 
<ross> okay. 
<rachel> i mean, i'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... anything we want. 
<chandler> my boss said i might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle.  
<ross> all right, we'll work it out. 
<rachel> thank you! thank you! 
<ross> yeah, yeah!  you sure this is what you want? 
<rachel> i think it is.  
<phoebe> ooh, what's going on? 
<rachel> i got a really incredible job offer. 
<joey> hey, great! all right! 
<phoebe> good for you! 
<rachel> it's in paris. 
<joey> what? no, no, no! no, no... no... no, no... no, too much is changing, okay? first, phoebe getting married  congratulations! ... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs... 
<monica> hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive... 
<joey> well, it comes and goes. i wouldn't trust it. 
<rachel> look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. and it means a lot if you could try to get on board. 
<phoebe> of course we can. congratulations.  yay!  joey... 
<joey> no, no, no. my hugs are reserved for people staying in america. 
<rachel>  joey, it would mean so... 
<joey> hey! no! get your france-going-arms away from me.  
<rachel> joey... 
<phoebe> you okay with this? 
<chandler> well, it makes me feel sad, but... 
<phoebe> talking to ross. 
<chandler> i see. 
<ross> well, rachel moving to another country? not being able to see her every day. how can i be okay with this? 
<monica> i know, but what are we gonna do? she really needs this job. 
<ross> do you think if the ralph lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it? 
<monica> how is that gonna happen? 
<chandler> is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes? 
<ross> i don't know. i could talk to her boss. yeah! i met him at that christmas party. we really hit it off. 
<monica> you mean the guy who kept calling you ron? 
<ross> i didn't say we were brothers. opening credits 
< 
<monica> hey phoebe. hey, tell me what you think. all right. the house next door to the one that we're buying in westchester? just went on the market. i wanna take a look at it, but chandler doesn't. 
<chandler> we close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. we're not very bright. 
<monica> but what if it is better than ours? should we at least look? 
<chandler> what do you think pheebs? 
<phoebe> well, i think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a baskin robbins... anyway... hey, isn't joey's agent estelle leonard? 
<chandler> yeah. 
<phoebe> she died. 
<chandler> you're kidding! 
<monica> that's terrible! 
<phoebe> yeah, last saturday. wow! she was the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic.  oh, wait a minute, i read the wrong one. 
<chandler> oh yeah? 
<phoebe> yeah, she was just an agent. 
<monica> joey's gonna be *so* upset. 
<chandler> i know. *he* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the atlantic. 
<phoebe> well, we cannot tell joey about this. he's already flipping out about everything that's changing. this will push him over the edge. 
<monica> seriously, you don't think we should tell him? 
<phoebe> well, not for a little while. let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else. 
<monica> what if he reads it in the paper? 
<chandler> unless snoopy says it to charlie brown, i think we're okay. 
< 
<s> may i help you? 
<ross> yeah, i'm a friend of rachel green's. uhm, actually we met at the christmas party about two years ago. 
<s> oh right, uhm, don? 
<ross> close. ron.  
<s> uh... what can i do for you? 
<ross> uhm, well... i'm here to see if you'll give rachel her job back. 
<s> ah, did she ask you to come here and do this? 
<ross> oh, no. at first i have to get you to agree. then we'll see if she wants to come back. 
<s> wow, that is tempting. 
<ross> look, she loved her job here. and let's face 
<s> you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. isn't that true? 
<s> she is good! 
<ross>  huh, i took a shot there. 
<s> but i'm sorry. there's nothing i can do... ah, it's not true, there is... nothing i want to do. 
<ross> i see... thanks very much.  is this your son? 
<s> yeah, his name is ross.  what? 
<ross> oh, nothing, it’s just, it’s close to ron. does he.. does little ross like dinosaurs by any chance? 
<s> yeah, they're all he talks about, why? 
<ross> how would he like to come with me to the museum of natural history after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. . i just heard it as you must have heard it and that’s not good. let me start again. i’m a paleontologist, you’ll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils! 
<s> you can really arrange that? 
<ross> you let rachel come back, and it’s done. 
<s> well, i guess having rachel back wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world. 
<ross> yeah! yes! thank you! this is great. thank you so much. and i swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life. 
<s> that’s great. i worry about little ross. he’s always reading, he's collecting rocks and he’s obsessed with dinosaurs. 
<ross> he’ll be fine. 
< 
<joey> hey phoebe. 
<phoebe> hey. everything ok? 
<joey> i’m just mad at my agent. 
<phoebe> estelle? why? 
<joey> there’s a part in a tv movie that i would be perfect for and i didn’t even be put up for it! she’d better have a good reason. 
<phoebe> i’m guessing she does. 
<joey> well  i’m wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this. 
<phoebe> well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. all right, i gotta go. just listen. promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her. 
<joey> ok. why? 
<phoebe> because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.  
<joey> i love that saying! . 
<joey> hello? 
<joey> i was just gonna call you! that’s weird. 
<s> it’s a little coincidental, but believable. . listen, i’m sure you’re wondering why i didn’t get you an audition for that tv movie. 
<joey> yeah, actually i am! 
<s> i guess i dropped the ball there. whoopsie! 
<joey> that’s it? you know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball. 
<s> don’t take that tone with me. who you think you are? alan lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic? 
<joey> no, no, look. all i’m saying is that you’re my agent, ok? and you’re not getting me into any auditions and i’m tired of it. 
<s> what are you saying? 
<joey> i’m saying that… . this isn't working for me anymore, ok? estelle, you’re fired. goodbye. . 
<phoebe> man, tough week for estelle! 
< 
<ross> hi. 
<rachel> hi. 
<ross> emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. you know she can’t sleep without it. 
<rachel> oh, well, she’s asleep now. stop forcing that thing on her. 
<ross> ok. 
<rachel> oh, you’re not gonna believe what happened to me today! ralph lauren called, and gave me my job back! 
<ross> nooo! 
<rachel> yee. i mean, it was so weirdest thing. they fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! i mean, that place must have been falling apart without me. 
<ross> so, you’re not going to paris. 
<rachel> no, i’m still going. 
<ross> wh… wh…what? 
<rachel> when the louis vuitton people found out that ralph lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! isn’t that great? 
<ross> yeeeah!  
< 
<monica> hi. we’re buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we could just take a look around. 
<s> oh, sure. i’m showing it to someone else right now, but please, look around. 
<monica> thanks. 
<chandler> it feels like we’re cheating on our house. and if we’re gonna cheat, shouldn’t it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won’t do? 
<monica> ours is so much better! this living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! what a hole! 
<s> so? what do you think? 
<monica> love it! 
<s> well, we already have one offer on it, and i think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one. 
<monica> they could be our neighbors, what are they like? 
<s> oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. she and her husband have two kids, he's on wall street and she… 
<s> oh my god! . 
< 
<phoebe> hey joey, want come with me to… are you ok? 
<joey> yeah, i just… i just feel bad about firing estelle. this is got to be killing her. 
<phoebe> no, that wouldn’t kill her. ordinary embolism might. 
<joey> i don’t know. she’s got to be taking it hard, i was like her only client. except for this guy who eats paper. and i’m guessing he eats more money than he makes. look, i know she’s not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. i’m gonna call her and hire her again. 
<phoebe> no, no, no! don't call her! you wait for her to call you  
<joey> why? 
<phoebe> because patience is the road to understanding  which ... is the key... to a happy heart. 
<joey>  you blow me away. 
<phoebe>  all right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you? 
<joey> i promise. and that means, never having to give a reason.  
< 
<s> what a small world! 
<chandler> and yet i never run into beyonce! 
<s> you two know each other? 
<s> oh, we go way back. before monica made an honest man out of him, chandler used to be my little love muffin! . so? are you guys thinking of getting this house too? ooh! are we gonna have a bidding war? i'd better warn you, i'm a toughie  
<chandler>  don't, don't!  
<monica> no, actually, we're buying the house next door.  
<chandler>  why!? 
<monica>  i don't know why. 
<s> ooh, that decides it then. i was on the fence. but knowing that you two would be our neighbors? ah! now we have to get it!  ellen, we're going to talk numbers.  
<chandler> this can not be happening! 
<monica> okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. maybe the janice's won't get it! maybe the other couple will. 
<chandler> the only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the hitlers. 
<monica>  okay, okay,  all right. what if we got both houses? huh? we can turn this house into a guest house. 
<chandler> that is a great idea! and by the way, i don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!? 
<monica> okay, you come up with an idea. 
<chandler> alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. we can still get out. 
<monica> but we love our house. 
<chandler> will we love it so much with her next door? and she's gonna be louder out here too. just the crickets and  "oh my god"! 
<monica> okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! i mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. i mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body.  
<chandler>  well, we have to do something. we can't have her living next door.  oh, that does it too.  
< 
<ross>  it's me. ron.  look, i um, i now rachel turned you down but i think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back. 
<s> this may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees, is not my main job. 
<ross> just hear me out. how would you feel about offering her a raise?  
<s>  not good, ron. 
<ross> perhaps i can persuade you. what if you can give your son this  genuine pterodactyl egg  replica. 
<s>  wow, that's pretty cool  
<ross> huh? so? we have a deal? 
<s> okay, you got it. 
<ross> yes! yes! 
<s> this is gonna make me very popular. 
<ross> oh,  believe me, the ladies, they love it! 
<s>  i meant with my son. 
<ross> good, 'cause the ladies, not so much.  
< 
<s> joey, this is al t. booker,  the guy who eats paper. i'm sure you've heard that estelle passed away.  i wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her at the westside chapel, tomorrow at ten. hope you can make it. 
<joey> oh my god.  hello? 
<phoebe>  joey, it's estelle.  
<joey> estelle? 
<phoebe> yeah, i wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me. 
<joey>  ok-ay. i just, i can't believe you're calling me? 
<phoebe> well, i didn't think i should just drop by... 
<joey> no, no, no!  don't drop by, don't drop by! 
<phoebe> anyway, you did what you had to do. i'm okay. 
<joey> can i ask you something? uhm, what's it like there? 
<phoebe>  it's alright. look kiddo, i gotta go. good luck with the career. you're gonna be huge. 
<joey> thanks for everything estelle. bye.  "out of area". boy, i'll say. 
< 
<s> well... i just talked to sid, we are definitely putting in an offer on the house... a-a-and i'll bet we get it. 
<chandler> the hitlers will be so disappointed. 
<s> all right, i got to run. tell monica i say goodbye. and... i'll see you later, neighbor.  
<chandler> wait! i just want you to know that... i'm so happy you're going to be here. 
<s> oh, me too...  
<chandler> because... that way... we can pick up where we left off. 
<s> huh? 
<chandler> i never stopped loving you. 
<s> oh... my... 
<chandler> yeah, yeah, yeah! i want you... i need you... i must have you janice litman goralnik neihosenstein. 
<s> chandler, what are you talking about? 
<chandler> now that you live next door, we can be together every day. sid and monica never have to know a thing. 
<s> i don't know what to say... i mean, you know, obviously we have this... heat between us. 
<chandler>  obviously. 
<s> but i love my husband. and i know you love your wife. now, i don't think we should get this house now. 
<chandler> don't say that. don't tangle the dream and take it away. 
<s> chandler, one of us has got to be strong. 
<chandler> i understand. 
<s> although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness...  goodbye chandler bing.  
<chandler>  they're never coming down now. 
< 
<rachel> hi! 
<ross> hey! 
<rachel> you are never going to believe what happened to me today. 
<ross> what? 
<rachel> ralph lauren called again and they offered me more money. 
<ross> they did? 
<rachel> yeah. it was the weirdest thing. zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. and that i should thank some ron... i don't even know what department that guy's in. 
<ross> so, what are you gonna do? 
<rachel> well, i took it. 
<ross> that's great! so you're staying in new york! 
<s> yay! whoo! yay!

<ross> right! 
<rachel> yeah, you know, was i looking forward to going to paris? sure. you know, was i excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? ooh, absolutely... oh...! yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. i'm fine going back to a job where i've pretty much gotten everything out of that i possibly can...  
<ross> uhm, i hadn't no you... i had no idea you were so excited about paris. uhm, i mean, you said you were scared. 
<rachel> well yeah, but i mean, it was good scared though, you know? like when i-moved-to-new-york scared. or uhm, when i-found-out-i-was-gonna-have-emma scared... but this is... fine. this is gonna be good.  
<ross>  you should go. 
<rachel> what? 
<ross> it's what you want. you should go. 
<rachel> you really think so? 
<ross> i really do. 
<rachel> but i already told zelner that i would come back... 
<ross>  i'm sure he'll understand. 
<rachel> all right. all right! i'm gonna do it. i'm gonna go to paris. 
<ross> yeah... 
<rachel> yeah! i'm going to paris. thank you, ross!

<chandler> hey. 
<ross> hey, where's rach?

<ross> hey, what do you think they're doing in there?

< 
<rachel> oh, pheebs, i don't even know where to start. 
<phoebe> ok well, before you do, i know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents,  but i do have something for you. 
<rachel> oh, oh. . what is this? 
<phoebe> it's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the dna to create your own pheebs! 
<rachel> i'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture! 
< 
<monica> chandler? i was just in our bedroom and i found these  on my pillow. 
<chandler> oh, yes. i decided to leave these out for you in case richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play! 
<monica> what are you talking about? these aren't mine. 
<chandler> oh yeah, right! good luck getting another scarf dance from me! 
<monica> that would be a terrible punishment. but, i'm serious, i've never seen these before.

<monica> yeah? 
<rachel> can you come here with me for a minute? 
<monica> sure. 
<phoebe>  are you wearing waterproof mascara? 
<monica> no. 
<phoebe> oh, you're so screwed.  
<ross>  hey. what was that all about? 
<phoebe> she's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually. 
<ross> are you kidding? oh my god... 
<phoebe> yeah, i know, it's gonna be even worse for you... god... ross, get ready to do some serious crying. 
<ross> oh, man, i'm not going to be able to handle this.  now i know how my students feel at the end of each year. and why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations. 
< 
<rachel> mon... okay... i've gotta... just say what it is i'm gonna say... none of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. no-one has been more like a sister to me... 
<monica> i know what you mean. you're like a sister to me too. 
<rachel>  i wouldn't know what i'm gonna do without you... 
<monica>  you're the best friend i ever had. 
<rachel>  
<monica> what? 
<rachel> i... i... i...  
<monica> that is so sweet.  
< 
<ross>  oh no, she took down monica... and i'm the crier in the family. oh god! i could be next. maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. oh, so that thing you said about the thing. it really made me think about that other thing. 
<chandler> uh, rach? 
<ross> well it's okay. chandler is talking to her. 
<joey> i really made you think about that thing uh? 
<chandler>  uh, rach... i think i have something that belongs to you.  
<rachel>  oh, i'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that i don't get. 
<chandler> no, no, no... they're really yours. we... found them in your old room. 
<rachel> well, these aren't mine. maybe monica used to use them with... 
<chandler> don't say richard! well, if they're not monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they? 
<rachel> well, i think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room. 
<chandler> pheebs! 
<phoebe>  yeah! 
<chandler> i think these are yours. 
<phoebe> these are not mine... look how flimsy they are, come on! good god! you try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice. 
<rachel>  can i talk to you alone for a minute? 
<chandler> sure.  you don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you? 
<phoebe> where do you think mike really is?  
< 
<rachel> oh honey... 
<chandler> let me just say something... because once we get into this, i'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... i just want to say that i... i love you... and, i'm gonna miss you. and i'm so sad that you're leaving. 
<rachel>  oh, you know what? let's not say anything else. i love you.  
<chandler> ooh, not so tight...  i'm sorry, just give me one more chance. 
<rachel> okay. oh...  
<rachel> oh! 
<chandler> i'm sor... just go. just go. i can't, i can't. 
< 
<monica>  so, i guess you're next. you're ready? 
<ross> i don't think so. 
<chandler> oh, you're definately not. i haven't cried like that in years. 
<monica> you cried yesterday at the six o'clock news. 
<chandler> that old woman was being scammed by her mechanic. 
<ross> god! i can't believe she saved me for last.  why are they taking so long? 
<phoebe> i don't know. but, god, joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.  
<s> no, no, no, no!  
<ross> okay, here we go... 
<rachel> oh...  well... 
<ross> yeah... 
<rachel> i think i'm gonna take off.  
<ross> huh? 
<rachel> oh, you guys. this was an amazing night. thank you so much. i love you. good night.  
<ross> what? i don't get a goodbye? 
<joey>  lucky bastard! 
< 
<ross> unbelievable. she says goodbye to everyone but me. 
<monica> well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit. 
<ross> well, it needs to be plicit. 
<joey> all right, let's think about this. i mean, there's got to be an explanation. uh... did you do anything to make her mad? 
<ross> no, i don't think so. 
<phoebe> you know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. it was pretty intense. 
<monica> yeah. mine too. 
<chandler> mine was a humdinger 
<ross>  o-kay... i mean, don't i deserve anything? i mean, a few tears, a cursory hug?  not from you!  
<phoebe> ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her. 
<monica> and say what? "you owe me a goodbye", i mean, he's got more pride than that. 
<ross> the hell i do!  
<ross> i don't get a goodbye? 
<rachel> what? 
<ross>  everyone gets a goodbye but me? what have i got to do to get a goodbye, huh? be best friends with you? uh, go out with you? have a baby with you? oh wait a minute, wait a minute, i did all those things. 
<rachel> ross... 
<ross> oh no, maybe it's me, i'm just not giving you enough credit. uh, i mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good...  it's physically impossible. you know what? after all we've been through, i can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. have a, have a good time in paris.  
< 
<monica> i hope ross isn't too upset. 
<joey> i'm sure he's not more bummed out than i am. 
<phoebe> tell me about it. 
<chandler> well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party. 
<phoebe> all right, i think i'm gonna head out. 
<monica> uh, where do you think you're going? 
<phoebe> i thought i was going home to go to bed, but i'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here. 
<monica> we're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. it would be great if you guys could pitch in. 
<chandler> joey and i can finish up in the guest room. 
<joey> oh, yeah, yeah, good idea.  
<monica> oh no! you and phoebe are gonna help me in here. 
<chandler>  you couldn't be cool.  
<monica> okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. the silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. got it? 
<monica> good! now i need you to be careful and efficient. and remember, if i am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong. 
<chandler> hey mon, i think i figured out whose handcuffs they are. 
<monica> you did? how? 
<chandler> well, i was cleaning out the closet and i found some pictures of them... being used. 
<monica> oh my god! let me see.  
<joey> who's that dirty old lady? 
<chandler> monica's grandmother. 
<monica> nana liked it rough!  
<s> hi! 
<s> hey! 
<joey> come on here, have a seat. 
<phoebe> how was your night? 
<s> oh, it was okay. i went to a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner. we went to this place that had... ooh...  hoo... ooh... anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers. 
<monica> erica, are you okay? 
<s> yeah, you know, maybe i ate too much. i keep getting these stomach aches. they come and go like every few minutes. 
<monica> oh my god! 
<chandler> relax! we just get her some antacids. 
<monica> she doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor. 
<chandler> oh my god! 
<phoebe> yeah, you got to get to the hospital. 
<monica> all right, chandler get the coats. erica let's go. phoebe and joey, keep packing! oh my god we're gonna have a baby. all right. we're gonna have a baby! oh my god, we're gonna have a baby! oh god, oh god, i got to sit down, i got to sit down. ooh!  
<chandler> honey, it's gonna be okay. 
<s> you can do this. just breathe. 
<monica> okay, okay... okay, i feel a little better. 
<s>  ooh! are you sure? 
<monica> oh... yes, i'm sure. oh honey, let's go. okay bye everyone.  
<joey> chandler, wait, wait, wait... 
<chandler> what? 
<joey> if you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger. 
< 
<rachel> you really think i didn't say goodbye to you because i don't care? 
<ross> that's what it seemed like. 
<rachel> i cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know one thing about me. 
<ross> fine, then why didn't you say something? 
<rachel> because it is too damn hard ross. i can't even begin to explain to you how much i'm gonna miss you. when i think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... okay, so if you think that i didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. it's because you mean more to me. so there, all right, there's your goodbye... oh! 
<ross> rach! 
<rachel> what? 
<ross> you keep, you keep... you can't... 
<rachel> what?  commercial break 
< 
<joey> a little more. 
<phoebe> okay.  
<joey> a little more, a little more.  a little more... all right. okay, all right, let's do this. 
<phoebe> all right, ready? 
<joey> yeah. all right, now give me your best shot. 
<phoebe> all right, here it goes...  
<joey>  doesn't work...   
<monica> erica, are you okay? 
<s> yeah, you know, maybe i ate too much. i keep getting these stomach-aches. they come and go like every few minutes. 
<monica> oh my god! 
<chandler> relax! we'll just get her some antacids. 
<monica> she doesn't have a stomach-ache. she's in labor! 
<chandler> oh my god!  
<rachel> so if you think i didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. it's because you mean more to me. 
<ross> rach! 
<rachel> what?!  
< 
<ross> hey. 
<rachel> shh.. go back to sleep. i have to go home. 
<ross> oh. this was amazing. 
<rachel> it really was. you've learned some new moves! 
<ross> yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "sex for dummies" as a joke. 
<rachel> ah. 
<ross> who's laughing now? 
<rachel> i know!  opening credits 
< 
<monica> breathe, breathe, breathe... good. 
<chandler> next time, can i say breathe? 
<monica> no, last time you said it like dracula, and it scared her! can i get you anything? you want some more ice chips? 
<s> no, i'm okay. 
<monica> alright, i'll be right back. 
<chandler> where are you going? 
<monica> to use the bathroom. 
<chandler> you can't leave me alone with her. 
<monica> what? 
<chandler> this is exactly the kind of social situation that i am not comfortable with! 
<monica> what kind of social situation are you comfortable with? 
<chandler> it's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together. 
<monica> you'll be fine. nah, you won't, but i'll be back in two minutes. 
<chandler> okay.  
<chandler> so, ah... any plans for the summer? 
<s> i don't know. maybe church-camp? 
<chandler> hah. may not wanna mention this. so, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts? 
<s> what? 
<chandler> well, it's just interesting. you know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.  
<chandler> one of life's great, unanswerable questions. i mean, who knows? maybe there's something even more painful than those things? like this. 
< 
<phoebe> morning. 
<joey> hey! 
<phoebe> what's that? 
<joey> it's my house-warming present for monica and chandler. 
<phoebe> it's a baby chick and duck! 
<joey> uh-huh. and i named them chick jr. and duck jr. 
<phoebe> i did not see that coming. 
<joey> yeah, i figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? it has that big backyard. and then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that chandler took the other chick and duck to. 
<phoebe> yes. 
<joey> yeah. it's a shame people can't visit there. 
<phoebe> that is the rule, though.  
<phoebe> guess what? you're almost an uncle! 
<ross> what? 
<joey> yeah, erica went into labor last night. monica and chandler are at the hospital right now! 
<ross> oh my god! 
<phoebe> yeah, and i have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl. 
<ross> phoebe, you were sure ben was gonna be a girl. 
<phoebe> have you seen him throw a ball? 
<ross> is rachel here? 
<joey> uh, i think she's still asleep. hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night? she seemed pretty pissed at you. 
<ross> uh, we, y'know, we worked things out. 
<phoebe> what's that smile? did something happen with you two? 
<ross> hey, i'm not one to kiss and tell, but i'm also not one to have sex and shut up. we totally did it! 
<joey> oh my god. you and rachel? 
<ross> i know, it's pretty great. 
<joey> so what does that mean? are you guys getting back together? 
<ross> oh, i.. i don't know. we didn't really get to talk. 
<phoebe> but do you wanna get back together? 
<ross> i don't know. it was incredible. i mean, it just felt so right. when i was holding her, i mean, i never wanted to let her go. you know what? yeah, i do. i wanna be together. 
<phoebe>  yay! 
<ross> shhh! 
<phoebe>  yay! 
<joey> so, so is she still going to paris? 
<ross> wow, i hadn't thought of that. i hope not. 
<phoebe> oh, this is like the best day ever. ever! you guys might get back together, monica and chandler are getting their baby, there are chicks and ducks in the world again! oh, i feel like i'm in a musical!  "daa - raa... when the sun comes up, bright and beaming! and the moon comes..."  
<rachel> morning! 
<phoebe> guess we'll never know how it ends. 
<joey> okay. 
<ross> hey.

<rachel> chick and the duck? didn't they die... 
<phoebe>  dive. yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.  
<ross> so...  
<ross> morning. 
<rachel> you too. last night was just wonderful. 
<ross> it really was. 
<rachel> i woke up today with the biggest smile on my face. 
<ross> i know, me too. it was... you know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be. 
<rachel> uh-huh. i know. it was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.  
< 
<monica> it's just a little bit more, honey. 
<s> help me! this hurts! 
<chandler> is it really that bad? 
<s> uh-huh! i think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which is worse!  
<s> the baby's head is crowning.  
<monica> oh! oh my god! that is the most beautiful top of a head i have ever seen! chandler, you have to see this!  
<chandler> i'm okay. 
<monica> chandler, you don't wanna miss this. this is the birth of your child! it's the miracle of life! 
<chandler> alright. wow, that is one disgusting miracle. 
<s> start pushing. here we go. here come the shoulders...  
<monica> it's a... it's a boy! 
<chandler> wow! 
<s> is he okay? 
<s> he's just fine. 
<monica> oh, you did it! 
<chandler>  it's a baby! a beautiful little baby! and some other stuff i'm gonna pretend i don't see. 
<s> would you like to cut the umbilical cord?  
<chandler> well, that's spongy. 
<monica>  oh, hey handsome! oh, i'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you!  oh, we are so lucky! 
<chandler> i know. he has your eyes.  
<chandler> i mean, i know that's not possible, but he does. 
<s> we'll just get him cleaned up a bit.  
<chandler> okay. 
<monica>  oh my god, he's beautiful. thank you so much. 
<s> i'm really happy for you guys. 
<chandler> how do you feel? 
<s> i'm tired! 
<s> well, you don't have that much time to relax. the other one will be along in a minute.  
<monica> i... i'm sorry, who should be along in a what now? 
<s> the next baby should be along in a minute. 
<monica> we only ordered one! 
<s> you know it's twins, right? 
<chandler> oh, yeah! these are the faces of two people in the know! commercial break 
< 
<s> i can't believe you didn't know it's twins! this has never happened before. 
<chandler> well, gosh. that makes me feel so special and good. 
<monica>  wait, did you know it was twins? 
<s> yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in ohio. 
<monica>  anybody tell you? 
<s> i don't think so. although, they did mention something about two heartbeats. but i thought that was just mine and the baby's. they kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and i thought well, that's good 'cause i'm having a baby. 
<monica> this is unbelievable. 
<s> twins actually run in my family. 
<chandler> interesting!  can i see you for a second?  
<chandler> what do we do? 
<monica> what do you mean "what do we do"? 
<chandler>  twins! twins!! 
<monica> chandler, you're panicking! 
<chandler> uh-huh! join me, won't you?! okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one? 
<monica> we can't split them up! 
<chandler> why not? we could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. i mean, that's a great day for everybody. 
<monica> okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible? 
<chandler> what if they're not? what if it's adopted by a king? 
<monica> yeah, because i hear the king is looking to adopt. 
<chandler> monica, we are not ready to have two babies! 
<monica> that doesn't matter! we have waited so long for this. i don't care if it's two babies. i don't care if it's three babies! i don't care if the entire cast of "eight is enough" comes out of there! we are taking them home, because they are our children! 
<chandler>  okay. shhh...  
<chandler> okay. 
<monica> okay! 
<chandler> okay! 
<s> it looks like we're about ready over here.  
<s> come on, erica, start pushing again now. 
<s> ow!  
<s> here she comes! 
<chandler>  she? it's a girl? 
<s> yeah. 
<chandler>  well, now we have one of each!  and that's enough! 
< 
<ross> and then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye. 
<joey> oh my god! what did you say? 
<ross> nothing! what do you say to that? 
<phoebe> ross, you've got to tell her how you feel! 
<ross> no way! 
<joey> you can't just give up! is that what a dinosaur would do? 
<ross> what? 
<joey> dude, i'm just trying to speak your language. 
<phoebe> ross, rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. if she did, she might feel differently. she might not even go. 
<ross> you really think so? 
<phoebe> i'm telling you! oh, okay! this is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song.  "bam-bam, don't take no for an answer. bam-bam, don't let love fly away. bam-bam-bam-bam..."  
<rachel> hi! 
<phoebe> can't a girl finish a song around here? 
<joey> hey! 
<rachel> hi! so i just dropped emma off at my mom's. 
<ross> okay. 
<joey> oh, you're not taking her with you tonight? 
<rachel> no, we decided that i would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring emma to paris on sunday. 
<phoebe> wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? good luck, mom. 
<rachel> are you kidding? eight hours with my mother talking about atkins? good luck, emma!  
<ross> alright, you know what? you're right. i should at least tell her how i feel.  
<joey> ross, wait! 
<ross> what? what? 
<joey> could you get me a muffin?  
<s> rachel? 
<rachel> yeah? 
<s> i... i know you're leaving tonight, but i just have to tell you. i love you.  
<s> i... i don't know if that changes your plans at all, but i thought you should know. 
<rachel>  gunther... oh... i love you too. probably not in the same way, but i do. and, and when i'm in a café, having coffee, or i see a man with hair brighter than the sun, i'll think of you. aw.  
<rachel> oh... bye guys.  
<ross> oh my god! 
<phoebe> unbelievable! 
<joey> hey, you know what might help? 
<ross> i'm not getting you a muffin! 
< 
<monica> do you think they recognize each other from in there? 
<chandler> maybe. unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet. 
<s> we're going to take erica to recovery now. 
<monica> there's something that we wanna tell you. we decided to name the girl-baby erica. 
<s> oh my god, that's just like my name! 
<monica> son of a gun, it is! 
<s> anyway, i'm gonna go and get some rest. i'm really glad i picked you guys. you're gonna make great parents. even chandler. 
<monica> okay, well, bye!

<phoebe> how sweet! oh, is that the baby?  
<joey> no, i sat in the paint.  
<ross> hey. 
<phoebe> hey. so, did you talk to rachel? 
<ross> no, and i'm not going to. 
<phoebe> what? 
<joey> why not? 
<ross> because she's just going to shoot me down. you guys saw what happened with gunther. that did not look like fun. 
<phoebe> how can you compare yourself to gunther? i mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. you have a relationship with her, you slept together last night. 
<ross> yeah, and she still wants to go! it's pretty clear where she is. 
<joey> yeah, i know what you mean. i mean, sometimes...  
<phoebe> uh, joe? 
<joey> damn it! 
<ross> look, even if i were gonna tell her, i don't have to do it now. okay? i'll be seeing her again. we've got time. 
<phoebe> no, you don't! she's going to paris! she is going to meet somebody. do you know how many hot guys there are in paris? it's... it's a city of gunthers!  
<s> hey! 
<phoebe> hey! what do you have there? 
<s> oh, i made a little something. if i had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but..  
<ross> oh my god! you did that yourself? 
<phoebe> honey, that's gorgeous! 
<joey> you know, the baby can't read, mike!  
<rachel> hi! you guys, the car-service just got here. i can't believe they're not home yet! i have to catch my stupid plane. i wanna see the baby! 
<joey> monica just called from the cab. she said they should be here any minute. and apparently, there's some big surprise. 
<phoebe> yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'cause my friend ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.  
<rachel> oh my god! 
<ross> oh my god!  
<rachel> hi! oh my gosh!  
<chandler> hey.   
<joey>  hey, so what is the big surprise? 
<rachel> oh.  
<ross> oh my god! 
<rachel> what... what... 
<ross> okay, okay, awkward question. the hospital knows you took two, right? 
<monica> yes, it's twins!

<chandler> her name is erica. 
<rachel> aw.. 
<joey> hey, that pregnant girl's name was erica. 
<chandler> yeah. it's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together. 
<monica> yeah, we named the boy jack after dad. 
<ross> aw, he's gonna be so happy. 
<phoebe> oh, jack bing. i love that. ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? "jack bing, morning gazette. i'm gonna blow this story wide open!"  
<rachel> oh my gosh. wow, so beautiful. 
<s>  i want one. 
<phoebe> oh yeah? well, tell me which one, and i'll try slip it in my coat. 
<s> seriously. wanna make one of those? 
<phoebe> one? how about a whole bunch? 
<s> really? 
<phoebe> yeah! ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the von trapp family! only without the nazis. although that sounds kinda dull. 
<rachel> oh, you guys, i can't believe this. but i'll leave now, or i'm gonna miss my plane. 
<monica> i'm just so glad you got to see the babies.  
<rachel> me too. oh, i'm just sorry i'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! alright, i can't say goodbye to you guys again. i love you all so much. 
<monica> i love you. 
<chandler> i love you. 
<monica> call us when you get there. 
<rachel> i will. ross, come here.

<joey> hey, maybe that's for the best. 
<ross> yeah? 
<joey> yeah. you know? you just... look, you gotta... you gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye? 
<phoebe> but now she'll never know how he feels! 
<joey> maybe that's okay. you know? maybe, maybe it is better this way? i mean, now, now you can move on. i mean, you've been trying to for so long, maybe now that you're on different continents..  right?  
<joey> maybe now you can actually do it. you know? you can finally get over her. 
<ross> yeah, that's true. except i don't wanna get over her. 
<joey> what?

<chandler> i don't know. maybe. 
<joey> oh my god! 
<chandler> i know! it's.. it's the foosball table. 
<joey> all right, you know what? we don't have a choice. it's like i would have said in that sci-fi movie if i'd gotten the part. "those are our men in there, we have to get them out! even if i have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine." 
<chandler> did that movie ever get made? 
<joey> it did not. 
< 
<phoebe> ross, where are you going? 
<ross> to talk to rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab? 
<phoebe> what? what are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? have you never chased anyone through the airport before? 
<ross> not since my cop-show got cancelled. 
<phoebe> you have to get a ticket to get past security. 
<ross> what? we're never gonna make it! 
<phoebe> not with that attitude! now, haul ass!  
<ross> okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great.

<rachel> hello? 
<phoebe> rachel? oh, good. hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane?

<rachel> phoebe? is everything okay? 
<phoebe> uhm, actually no. no, you've... you have to get off the plane.

<rachel> oh, honey, i'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.  
<rachel> alright, look, i have to go. i love you, and i will call you the minute i get to paris.  
<rachel> oh, that was just my crazy friend. she told me i should get off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left philange. 
<rachel> i wouldn't worry about it. she's always coming up with stuff like this, and you know what? she's almost never right. 
<rachel> well...  
<rachel> wait, what are you doing? feeling something's wrong with the left philange.

<joey> i'm gonna miss these little guys. it was nice having birds around again. 
<chandler> hey, you know what? maybe we should keep them here with you. 
<joey> what? 
<chandler> yeah, i mean we've got a lot going on right now. and, plus, here they'd have their own room. 
<joey> i could get a goose! 
<chandler> you know, i - i think you're set with the poultry. 
<joey> thanks man. did you hear that, you guys? you're gonna get to stay here! and, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit.

< 
<rachel>  ross, hi. it's me. i just got back on the plane. and i just feel awful. that is so not how i wanted things to end with us. it's just that i wasn't expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... and... and now i'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff i should have said, and i didn't. i mean, i didn't even get to tell you that i love you too. because of course i do. i love you. i love you. i love you. what am i doing? i love you! oh, i've gotta see you. i've gotta get off this plane. 
<ross> oh my god!

<rachel> okay. you and me, alright? this is it. 
<ross> this is it. unless we're on a break.  
<ross> don't make jokes now.  
< 
<monica> okay, please be careful with that. it was my grandmother's. be careful.  
<monica> if that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.  
<ross> wow. 
<rachel> i know. it seems smaller somehow. 
<joey> has it always been purple? 
<chandler>  look around, you guys. this was your first home. and it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. but more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!  
<phoebe> hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment? 
<monica> oh, yeah, that's true. 
<ross> uh, i haven't. 
<monica> wait a minute. what about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer? 
<ross> do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up? 
<monica> oh, honey, i forgot. i promised treeger that we'd leave our keys. 
<chandler> oh, okay.  
<phoebe> so, i guess this is it. 
<joey> yeah. i guess so. 
<monica>  this is harder than i thought it would be. 
<chandler> oh, it's gonna be okay.  
<rachel>  do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time? 
<monica> we got some time. 
<rachel> okay, should we get some coffee? 
<chandler> sure. where?   
<monica> erica, are you okay? 
<s> yeah, you know, maybe i ate too much. i keep getting these stomach-aches. they come and go like every few minutes. 
<monica> oh my god! 
<chandler> relax! we'll just get her some antacids. 
<monica> she doesn't have a stomach-ache. she's in labor! 
<chandler> oh my god!  
<rachel> so if you think i didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. it's because you mean more to me. 
<ross> rach! 
<rachel> what?!  
< 
<ross> hey. 
<rachel> shh.. go back to sleep. i have to go home. 
<ross> oh. this was amazing. 
<rachel> it really was. you've learned some new moves! 
<ross> yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "sex for dummies" as a joke. 
<rachel> ah. 
<ross> who's laughing now? 
<rachel> i know!  opening credits

<monica> breathe, breathe, breathe... good. 
<chandler> next time, can i say breathe? 
<monica> no, last time you said it like dracula, and it scared her! can i get you anything? you want some more ice chips? 
<s> no, i'm okay. 
<monica> alright, i'll be right back. 
<chandler> where are you going? 
<monica> to use the bathroom. 
<chandler> you can't leave me alone with her. 
<monica> what? 
<chandler> this is exactly the kind of social situation that i am not comfortable with! 
<monica> what kind of social situation are you comfortable with? 
<chandler> it's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together. 
<monica> you'll be fine. nah, you won't, but i'll be back in two minutes. 
<chandler> okay.  
<chandler> so, ah... any plans for the summer? 
<s> i don't know. maybe church-camp? 
<chandler> hah. may not wanna mention this. so, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts? 
<s> what? 
<chandler> well, it's just interesting. you know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.  
<chandler> one of life's great, unanswerable questions. i mean, who knows? maybe there's something even more painful than those things? like this. 
< 
<phoebe> morning. 
<joey> hey! 
<phoebe> what's that? 
<joey> it's my house-warming present for monica and chandler. 
<phoebe> it's a baby chick and duck! 
<joey> uh-huh. and i named them chick jr. and duck jr. 
<phoebe> i did not see that coming. 
<joey> yeah, i figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? it has that big backyard. and then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that chandler took the other chick and duck to. 
<phoebe> yes. 
<joey> yeah. it's a shame people can't visit there. 
<phoebe> that is the rule, though.  
<phoebe> guess what? you're almost an uncle! 
<ross> what? 
<joey> yeah, erica went into labor last night. monica and chandler are at the hospital right now!

<joey> oh my god. you and rachel? 
<ross> i know, it's pretty great. 
<joey> so what does that mean? are you guys getting back together? 
<ross> oh, i.. i don't know. we didn't really get to talk. 
<phoebe> but do you wanna get back together?

<rachel> uh-huh. i know. it was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.  
< 
<monica> it's just a little bit more, honey.

<chandler> well, gosh. that makes me feel so special and good. 
<monica>  wait, did you know it was twins? 
<s> yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in ohio. 
<monica>  anybody tell you? 
<s> i don't think so. although, they did mention something about two heartbeats. but i thought that was just mine and the baby's. they kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and i thought well, that's good 'cause i'm having a baby. 
<monica> this is unbelievable. 
<s> twins actually run in my family. 
<chandler> interesting!  can i see you for a second?  
<chandler> what do we do? 
<monica> what do you mean "what do we do"? 
<chandler>  twins! twins!! 
<monica> chandler, you're panicking! 
<chandler> uh-huh! join me, won't you?! okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one? 
<monica> we can't split them up! 
<chandler> why not? we could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. i mean, that's a great day for everybody. 
<monica> okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible? 
<chandler> what if they're not? what if it's adopted by a king? 
<monica> yeah, because i hear the king is looking to adopt. 
<chandler> monica, we are not ready to have two babies! 
<monica> that doesn't matter! we have waited so long for this. i don't care if it's two babies. i don't care if it's three babies! i don't care if the entire cast of "eight is enough" comes out of there! we are taking them home, because they are our children! 
<chandler>  okay. shhh...  
<chandler> okay. 
<monica> okay! 
<chandler> okay! 
<s> it looks like we're about ready over here.  
<s> come on, erica, start pushing again now. 
<s> ow!  
<s> here she comes! 
<chandler>  she? it's a girl? 
<s> yeah. 
<chandler>  well, now we have one of each!  and that's enough! 
< 
<ross> and then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye. 
<joey> oh my god! what did you say? 
<ross> nothing! what do you say to that? 
<phoebe> ross, you've got to tell her how you feel! 
<ross> no way! 
<joey> you can't just give up! is that what a dinosaur would do? 
<ross> what? 
<joey> dude, i'm just trying to speak your language. 
<phoebe> ross, rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. if she did, she might feel differently. she might not even go. 
<ross> you really think so? 
<phoebe> i'm telling you! oh, okay! this is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song.  "bam-bam, don't take no for an answer. bam-bam, don't let love fly away. bam-bam-bam-bam..."  
<rachel> hi! 
<phoebe> can't a girl finish a song around here? 
<joey> hey! 
<rachel> hi! so i just dropped emma off at my mom's. 
<ross> okay. 
<joey> oh, you're not taking her with you tonight? 
<rachel> no, we decided that i would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring emma to paris on sunday. 
<phoebe> wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? good luck, mom. 
<rachel> are you kidding? eight hours with my mother talking about atkins? good luck, emma!  
<ross> alright, you know what? you're right. i should at least tell her how i feel.  
<joey> ross, wait! 
<ross> what? what? 
<joey> could you get me a muffin?  
<s> rachel? 
<rachel> yeah? 
<s> i... i know you're leaving tonight, but i just have to tell you. i love you.  
<s> i... i don't know if that changes your plans at all, but i thought you should know. 
<rachel>  gunther... oh... i love you too. probably not in the same way, but i do. and, and when i'm in a café, having coffee, or i see a man with hair brighter than the sun, i'll think of you. aw.  
<rachel> oh... bye guys.  
<ross> oh my god! 
<phoebe> unbelievable! 
<joey> hey, you know what might help? 
<ross> i'm not getting you a muffin! 
< 
<monica> do you think they recognize each other from in there? 
<chandler> maybe. unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet. 
<s> we're going to take erica to recovery now. 
<monica> there's something that we wanna tell you. we decided to name the girl-baby erica. 
<s> oh my god, that's just like my name! 
<monica> son of a gun, it is! 
<s> anyway, i'm gonna go and get some rest. i'm really glad i picked you guys. you're gonna make great parents. even chandler. 
<monica> okay, well, bye! 
<s> bye! 
<chandler> bye! 
<monica> we'll call you! 
<s> okay. 
<chandler> have fun at church-camp!  
<monica> oh, look at these little bunnies! 
<chandler> i know! you ready to trade? 
<monica> okay. 
<chandler> okay. 
<monica> alright, let's see..  
<chandler> we could trade later. 
<monica> yeah, i'm good. 
< 
<phoebe> hey, what are you working on? 
<joey> it's a... it's a "welcome home" sign for the baby.  
<phoebe> how sweet! oh, is that the baby?  
<joey> no, i sat in the paint.  
<ross> hey. 
<phoebe> hey. so, did you talk to rachel? 
<ross> no, and i'm not going to. 
<phoebe> what? 
<joey> why not? 
<ross> because she's just going to shoot me down. you guys saw what happened with gunther. that did not look like fun. 
<phoebe> how can you compare yourself to gunther? i mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. you have a relationship with her, you slept together last night. 
<ross> yeah, and she still wants to go! it's pretty clear where she is. 
<joey> yeah, i know what you mean. i mean, sometimes...  
<phoebe> uh, joe? 
<joey> damn it! 
<ross> look, even if i were gonna tell her, i don't have to do it now. okay? i'll be seeing her again. we've got time. 
<phoebe> no, you don't! she's going to paris! she is going to meet somebody. do you know how many hot guys there are in paris? it's... it's a city of gunthers!  
<s> hey! 
<phoebe> hey! what do you have there? 
<s> oh, i made a little something. if i had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but..  
<ross> oh my god! you did that yourself? 
<phoebe> honey, that's gorgeous! 
<joey> you know, the baby can't read, mike!  
<rachel> hi! you guys, the car-service just got here. i can't believe they're not home yet! i have to catch my stupid plane. i wanna see the baby! 
<joey> monica just called from the cab. she said they should be here any minute. and apparently, there's some big surprise. 
<phoebe> yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'cause my friend ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.  
<rachel> oh my god! 
<ross> oh my god!  
<rachel> hi! oh my gosh!  
<chandler> hey.   
<joey>  hey, so what is the big surprise? 
<rachel> oh.  
<ross> oh my god! 
<rachel> what... what... 
<ross> okay, okay, awkward question. the hospital knows you took two, right? 
<monica> yes, it's twins! 
<ross> oh my god. 
<joey> oh, they're so cute! now, what, what kinds are they? 
<monica>  this is a boy,  and that's a girl. 
<chandler> her name is erica. 
<rachel> aw.. 
<joey> hey, that pregnant girl's name was erica. 
<chandler> yeah. it's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together. 
<monica> yeah, we named the boy jack after dad. 
<ross> aw, he's gonna be so happy. 
<phoebe> oh, jack bing. i love that. ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? "jack bing, morning gazette. i'm gonna blow this story wide open!"  
<rachel> oh my gosh. wow, so beautiful. 
<s>  i want one. 
<phoebe> oh yeah? well, tell me which one, and i'll try slip it in my coat. 
<s> seriously. wanna make one of those? 
<phoebe> one? how about a whole bunch? 
<s> really? 
<phoebe> yeah! ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the von trapp family! only without the nazis. although that sounds kinda dull. 
<rachel> oh, you guys, i can't believe this. but i'll leave now, or i'm gonna miss my plane. 
<monica> i'm just so glad you got to see the babies.  
<rachel> me too. oh, i'm just sorry i'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! alright, i can't say goodbye to you guys again. i love you all so much. 
<monica> i love you. 
<chandler> i love you. 
<monica> call us when you get there. 
<rachel> i will. ross, come here.  
<rachel> i just want you to know.. last night.. i'll never forget it. 
<ross> neither will i.  
<rachel> alright, now i really have to go. okay. au revoir! oh, they're gonna really hate me over there.  
<phoebe> so, you just let her go? 
<ross> yeah. 
<joey> hey, maybe that's for the best. 
<ross> yeah? 
<joey> yeah. you know? you just... look, you gotta... you gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye? 
<phoebe> but now she'll never know how he feels! 
<joey> maybe that's okay. you know? maybe, maybe it is better this way? i mean, now, now you can move on. i mean, you've been trying to for so long, maybe now that you're on different continents..  right?  
<joey> maybe now you can actually do it. you know? you can finally get over her. 
<ross> yeah, that's true. except i don't wanna get over her. 
<joey> what? 
<ross> i don't! i wanna be with her. 
<joey> really? 
<ross> yeah, i'm gonna go after her. 
<joey> yeah, you are!

<joey> this is so cool! 
<chandler> i have no idea what's going on, but i am excited! 
<joey> but ross, ross. what do you, what do you think she's going to say? 
<ross> i don't know, but i.. look, even if she shoots me down, at least i won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. where - where is my coat?! 
<phoebe> you didn't bring one! my cab's downstairs, i'll drive you to the airport. 
<ross> okay, guys, wish me luck. 
<phoebe> hurry! 
<joey> good luck, good luck!  
< 
<ross> there's no seatbelt! 
<phoebe> that's okay. if - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car.  
<ross> alright, alright, let's do this! 
<phoebe> okay!  
<ross> hey! 
<s> 18th and east end.

<chandler> really? you got us a chick and a duck? 
<monica> oh, great! just what you want for a new house with infants. bird feces. 
<joey> yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone! 
<chandler> oh, don't worry, we'll find them. 
<monica> actually, i'm gonna go check on the twins. 
<chandler> alright.  
<monica> oh god! what did i just step on? 
<joey> oh! 
<chandler> it's okay, it's just an egg roll. 
<monica> oh.. 
<joey> you stepped on my egg roll? 
<monica> i'm sorry, i didn't know to look for chinese food on the floor. 
<joey> just put it on a plate and leave.  
<chandler> okay, let's find these birds. 
<joey> alright.  
<joey> wait, wait. do you hear that?  
<joey> oh! they're in the table! 
<chandler> well, that can't be good! 
<joey> we gotta get them out of there! 
<chandler> how? 
<joey> oh, oh! maybe we can lure them out. you know any birdcalls? 
<chandler> oh, tons, i'm quite the woodsman. 
<joey> well, maybe we can just tip the table a little. 
<chandler> joey, wait! the ball! 
<joey> oh!  
<joey> oh god! so what do we do? 
<chandler> i don't know. maybe we can open this up somehow. 
<joey> okay. 
<chandler> no... it's all glued together. 
<joey> does that mean we have to bust it open? 
<chandler> i don't know. maybe. 
<joey> oh my god! 
<chandler> i know! it's.. it's the foosball table. 
<joey> all right, you know what? we don't have a choice. it's like i would have said in that sci-fi movie if i'd gotten the part. "those are our men in there, we have to get them out! even if i have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine." 
<chandler> did that movie ever get made? 
<joey> it did not. 
< 
<phoebe> ross, where are you going? 
<ross> to talk to rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab? 
<phoebe> what? what are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? have you never chased anyone through the airport before? 
<ross> not since my cop-show got cancelled. 
<phoebe> you have to get a ticket to get past security. 
<ross> what? we're never gonna make it! 
<phoebe> not with that attitude! now, haul ass!  
<ross> okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great. 
< please? 
<rachel> oh my god! i was so afraid i wasn't gonna remember any of my high-school french, but i understood every word you just said! 
<rachel> oh.  
<rachel> oh, shoot. i had it. oh, i can't believe this. 
<rachel> i have it, i have it, i have it. oh, okay, i can't find it, but i remember that i was in seat 32c, because that's my bra-size. 
<rachel> okay, fine! but you know what? if i was in 36d, we would not be having this problem. 
< 
<ross> hey, i need a ticket. 
<phoebe> just one? i drive you all the way down here, and i don't get to see how it works out? 
<ross> fine, two tickets, i need two tickets.

<phoebe> you don't have any other choice!  
<rachel> hello? 
<phoebe> rachel? oh, good. hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane? 
<rachel> yeah. 
<phoebe>  for what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport. 
<ross> yay. 
<phoebe> uh, rach, hang on.  
<rachel> phoebe? is everything okay? 
<phoebe> uhm, actually no. no, you've... you have to get off the plane. 
<rachel> what? why? 
<phoebe> i have this feeling that something's wrong with it. something is wrong with the left philange. 
<rachel> oh, honey, i'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.  
<rachel> alright, look, i have to go. i love you, and i will call you the minute i get to paris.  
<rachel> oh, that was just my crazy friend. she told me i should get off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left philange. 
<rachel> i wouldn't worry about it. she's always coming up with stuff like this, and you know what? she's almost never right. 
<rachel> well...  
<rachel> wait, what are you doing? feeling something's wrong with the left philange. 
<rachel> could i get some peanuts?  
<rachel> this is ridiculous! i...  
<rachel> yeah, okay.

<joey> yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it! 
<monica> yeah, they were just slowing me down. alright, i have to get back to the babies. i'll see you girls later.  
<chandler> sorry about the table, man.

<chandler> well, at least we got these little guys out. 
<joey> yeah. 
<chandler> aww, we were worried about you! hm. i guess i better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh? 
<joey> i'm gonna miss these little guys. it was nice having birds around again. 
<chandler> hey, you know what? maybe we should keep them here with you. 
<joey> what? 
<chandler> yeah, i mean we've got a lot going on right now. and, plus, here they'd have their own room. 
<joey> i could get a goose! 
<chandler> you know, i - i think you're set with the poultry. 
<joey> thanks man. did you hear that, you guys? you're gonna get to stay here! and, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit. 
<chandler> i think there may be another reason. so, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake? 
<joey> uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.

< 
<rachel>  ross, hi. it's me. i just got back on the plane. and i just feel awful. that is so not how i wanted things to end with us. it's just that i wasn't expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... and... and now i'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff i should have said, and i didn't. i mean, i didn't even get to tell you that i love you too. because of course i do. i love you. i love you. i love you. what am i doing? i love you! oh, i've gotta see you. i've gotta get off this plane. 
<ross> oh my god!

<ross> me neither, okay? we are - we're done being stupid. 
<rachel> okay. you and me, alright? this is it. 
<ross> this is it. unless we're on a break.  
<ross> don't make jokes now.  
< 
<monica> okay, please be careful with that. it was my grandmother's. be careful.  
<monica> if that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.  
<ross> wow. 
<rachel> i know. it seems smaller somehow. 
<joey> has it always been purple? 
<chandler>  look around, you guys. this was your first home. and it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. but more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!  
<phoebe> hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment? 
<monica> oh, yeah, that's true. 
<ross> uh, i haven't. 
<monica> wait a minute. what about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer? 
<ross> do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up? 
<monica> oh, honey, i forgot. i promised treeger that we'd leave our keys. 
<chandler> oh, okay.  
<phoebe> so, i guess this is it. 
<joey> yeah. i guess so. 
<monica>  this is harder than i thought it would be. 
<chandler> oh, it's gonna be okay.  
<rachel>  do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time? 
<monica> we got some time. 
<rachel> okay, should we get some coffee?
