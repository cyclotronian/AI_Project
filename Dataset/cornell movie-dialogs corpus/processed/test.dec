Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Forget it.
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Let me see what I can do.
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
I believe we share an art instructor
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
What good stuff?
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
What do you think?
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Just sent 'em through.
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
She kissed me.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
Do what?
Nope - just came by to chat
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
An attempted slit.
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
Oh, right.  Friday.
I know a lot more than that
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
I thought you were above all that
Busy
Then why'd you ask?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
I heard there was a poetry reading.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Look up, sunshine
C'mon.  It's not that bad
So what's your excuse?
Hearsay.
What?
You tell me.
Answer the question, Patrick
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
Yeah.  I guess.
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
I'm likin' you guys better
Make anyone cry today?
Tumescent!
Absolutely not.
We'll all go crazy...
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
I haven't given you much of a life.
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
I find that hard to believe.
May I ask by whom?
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
I am afraid this is not the worst news.
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
What...?  Do I have so many already?
Chief says -- he has a God.
Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You tell that to them!
Yes, Your Majesty.
And who would you think of, for such a task?
You bring the cigarettes?
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
What's your cut?  How much?
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
What else do you need?
Back in the Czech Republic?
Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
Yes, I considered it.
In the kitchen.
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
You ready?
You got any better ideas?
Of course.
I don't have a girlfriend.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
Alright.
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Tonight.
Thank you.
Jesus Christ.
I'm not moody.
I am butcher.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
Two weeks.
You said speak Czech!
I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Sit down!
The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
It's easy to learn.
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
I want to hear everything he said.
I'm trying to tell you.
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
That's what it looks like to me.
He's my collar!
He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Yes?
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
That seems very unlikely.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
Hammond.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
You got a real big mouth, convict.
Pros.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
Now you're talkin'. See ya...
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
Sure, anything you want.
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
We eat when I say we eat.
Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
Come on.
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
You stay with me...
You sure that's the reason?
I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
How did they get away?
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
What?
Who gives a fuck what you think?
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
No wonder you're so popular.
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
Shrink major, not a shrink.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
Five.  On credit.
At your service.
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
I know...
So you do know her.
Of course.
And then?
Thank you, Mr. President.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
They are... with me...
So, just how big was this fare?
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
...Ma???
It's like a cab isn't it?
To save the world.
Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
What is... Make Love?
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
Apipoussan!
No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!
But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
To fame.. salud..
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Got it.
...I can't wait to be among you.
I understand.
Tom?  Where have you been... ?
I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
You're killing me...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
What are you talking about?
Dino...
If it's not him, there's no deal.
Call me Tom.
I know what you did.
Fuck you!
I told you, I don't know.
Stop talking.
Where?  Show me where.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
There's not much illegal.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
Where does he sell it?
Alright, I get the picture.
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
Who is he, his name?
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
I'm not positive this means anything.
I'm here.
You told me to look, so I looked.
What was she running from?
I don't know.
I didn't mean to...
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
Yes.
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
Who are you?
No...
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
Yes.  I remember her.
No, sir, he is not.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
You could do worse.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Nice neighborhood.
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
You just stay put.  You need rest.
And ours.  It's our grandchild.
It's lonely in there, in my room.
Oh...I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would be.
Yeah...I guess.
There you go.  Love you.
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
Why don't you two stick to reality.
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
My baby!
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
Who?
Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
Two hours a day, six days a week.
He invited me to his house last night.
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
Right at our one-eyed friend!
Something wrong?
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
Huh?
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
Minus three.
Obviously.
<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
Guaranteed, eh?
Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
Sun's gettin high.
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
You stayed away?
Where'd you get the blood?
Open the door. We're late.
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
Yeah.
Do what?
Break stuff?
To us it was.
No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
It's stupid.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.
Pop?
Don't go playing policeman.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
Yeah. A few things.
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
Where's Jill?
We've done all our talking, Wade.
Yeah, lots.
I know who it is.
Mel Gordon.
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
Said what?
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
You've been married twice --
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
What?
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!
No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
You think Jack shot him?
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
Huh?
Yeah. I forgot.
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
A hunting accident is perfect.
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
It was the experience of a lifetime.
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
You read my mind.
Put your pilot on.
He's busy being dead.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.
My husband is a very courageous man.
How can you? I mean they're people.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
That isn't necessary.
Can't it wait?
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
We're under attack.
We're handling it, sir.
who can I say is calling?
I might still have a few chips left.
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
Commissioner.
Yes I did...
That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
If that's the way you want it.
Ted!
Not now, Elaine.
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
That's right -- premature ejection.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
That's my girl.
Can't we change course?
Yes, sir.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
You have great tits.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
Scraps.
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
No.  Poached.  Over.
Just poached on toast.  Over.
Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
No. I'm all alone.
Surely you can't be serious.
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
But if you'll just give me...
Headquarters!? What is it?
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Oh, I'd love to.
Okay, this is one of my favorites.
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.
I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
Yes...
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
Nice signal, dickwad!
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.
But I-- .
In the other man's rectum.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
No, George -- you're missing the point.  The drug is evidence.  We need to have the evidence, ya know?
Fuck procedure.
You look very good.
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
Did he find anything?
Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
Don't tell me what to think.
What?
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Whatever gave you that idea?
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
That's right.
If I go.
That's the plan.  My word on it.
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
...We're coming in.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
We ain't going anywhere.
Anytime.  Anywhere.
Hudson, give us a break.
No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?
Just get back here!
No.. I've slept enough.
You promise?
Did you ever have a baby?
Right here, baby.  Right here.
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
Indeed.
Yes.
How do you know?
What?
Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio!
Where?
Yes!
You borrowed money from your mother?
Well, don't do that again!
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
No one.
Why not?
Alone.
Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
And I'm asking you -
When, may I ask?
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.
Michael!
Yes. He is a little strange.
Why not?
Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
Yes, indeed.
Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
Well, yes, I admit it is.
I have no idea.
Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
No one calls you that.
What medicine?
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
Are you sure it's an opera?
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
Sssh! Stay here.
I liked the horse.
No.
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
My answer is no, Mozart.
Really?
How could I not?
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
Do you have a daughter?
Ah. Italian?
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
You mean she's not coming back?
I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
What?
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
So now - A minor. Suddenly.
Common time.
Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!
Just let me tell you how it begins.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
Who is on this committee?
Mozart -
Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
So?
In the sight of God that is a sin.
Where?
Here in Vienna.
Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
What happened to them?
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
Has his friend appeared to him again?
I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
No, why?
Tea would be nice.
Yes?
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
Call me Alex.
Right.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
Now I'm embarrassed.
I wasn't hallucinating.
Do me an enormous favor?
See you later.
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
I looked.
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
You ask them.
Come on, I'm freezing.
I have no idea.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Heathcliffe.
Come on, where?
Not far enough. Come on.
Life mocks me even in death.
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
We were attacked by a werewolf.
I'm not listening!
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
I wanted to see you.
You must believe me.
I will not accept this! Now go away!
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
You look awful.
Thank you.
Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
No.
And what, Sergeant?
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
You understand?
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But it's the truth - honest it is. I was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she—
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
I haven't got it.
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
Don't you know?
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
My apartment.
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals—  I think I will have a drink.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
Got a handkerchief?
Hello, darling.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn—
Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
I can't tell you.
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right.  Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!
I'm afraid so.
Hardly.
Matt, come here!
The ten dollars.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
They must have turned him down.
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after—
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
What time did you get in?
Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
You stay out of this, Bob.
I swear --
Swear on Jimmy's grave.
... Will Perry ...
The Army can hang him.
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
Hey!
He's been full of vinegar lately.
You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
I think I recognize you.
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
What is wrong with you?
She was European!
It was exciting.
Perfect, Cole.
Sorry.
I got three.
It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.
Sure, cousin.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
I got us through the War all right.
A trap.
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
You ride like a Comanche.
Which one, right or left?
What?
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
You are a charmer.
If I could go back to farming --
Oh yeah.
That he was.
So what was he?
Yeah Jimmy?
Everything but the boring parts.
Say your prayers?
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
Nuh-huh ...
You're sick of my company?
I shouldn't tease a hero.
A river pirate.
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
Yes ma'am.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
And the same age Web was. No.
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
Oh, that's the best part.
What is that?
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
On a lot of lithium?
Courtney? Dinner?
Dorsia's nice.
Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?
Is it a what?
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Is your Evian spiked?
Everybody's rich.
It's not.
I'm just leaving.
I have to return some videotapes.
Good coloring.
No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy.
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
It's just not.
Why not, you stupid bastard?
Uh huh.
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
What? CARRUTHERS  I'll call you.
It looks that way, doesn't it?
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
Leaving what?
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
Oh really? That's great.
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
Patrick?
Who?
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
Well, isn't this a coincidence.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go.
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
Don't tell him you're here.
Paul Owen.
I want the number, idiot.  Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you.
No.
Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
No, really. I'm okay.
You sure?
Yale thing?
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
Well, maybe he did, huh?
Hmmm.
That's so typical, isn't it?
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
I lost my job...
I'm hungry.
Is that a raincoat?
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
Milo! What about --?
He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?"
That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire.  'Not saying it makes sense.
So you believe me?
Nothing?
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
Don't we have any chopsticks?
It's gonna get cold.
He'll tell me when he gets home.
My goodness.
Yes sir.
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
We could move 'em up here.
I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.
Low enough to relay internet traffic.
Were the flags for Teddy?
Sure.
In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
Those really weird, short lines.
Got out of my other commitment.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
Didn't mean to pry. I just have this theory. Some of us who got to good at this? We were -- escaping something.
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Why would you do a thing like --
But why would they --?
Hmm?
Why?!
It's three years old, it --
Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
What?!
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
I met this girl.
What does that mean?
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big...  'Guess he needs to micro-manage something.
Speaking of which...
You don't look anything like a three- year-old.
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
Care for some saki?
Sak-i it to me!
Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
Thank you, Exposition.
Thanks.
Thank you, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
What's the other?
What?
Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
That's not your mother, that's a man!
Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.
Austin, I have something for you as well.
Good on ya, man.
Why not? It's a question.
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
Man, you are one chilly square!
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
Do you want to talk to him?
I don't get it.
I'm sorry.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
Smashing idea! Give it to me.
Behave!
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Right. Okay. Moving on.
I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it.
Dr. Evil?
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
I don't want to.
How's Austin?
You didn't...
We don't judge here.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
Peter ...
There, look!
I'm afraid that's impossible.
As you see.
Then you can't come in.
Really -- what happened in 1922?
We have met ...
This isn't a game.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
Entirely. On the other hand  Mad people get things done. Let me show you --
Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
As per mother's instructions.
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
No thanks.
I meant me.
Did he say who?
Is there anything that isn't?
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Was I?
Nothing personal.
Because you always obey orders ...
It wasn't me; you have my word.
You're playing games.
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
Have we been invited?
Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.
Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
You're not venturing alone, surely.
Dead, I'm afraid.
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
Walk over to the window ...
The last one you'll ever see.
Perish the thought.
I was at Harrow ...
But did they teach you this?
I do.
Did I? My mistake.
Debbie's marrying Rick.
Really -- you went with him for two years.
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em. 
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
No.
You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
Fan out and look for them.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Keep me informed.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
1002.
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
Um... that's very relaxing.
Gonna get married...
Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
Yes...
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
Ilene, are you crazy?
You know your father enjoys his company.
Screw you...
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
What do you mean, it changes?
All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
The phone made me do it!
I'm not really hungry.
I'm saved. Let's party!
Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
Right... Think it over.
That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
So you're going to fight fires now, huh?
In the Field Museum once.
It works.
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.
Shut up!
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
Well, you did invite me here.
Got anything to drink in there?
Homey.
Hi.
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
See you Monday. Sir.
No it couldn't.
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
Yeah? Airtight?
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
Engine 115, right?
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
You can't keep being his father...
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
Yeah.
Yes.
Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
What money?
Don't bullshit me.
You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
That 50 G could help you --
Yeah!
Give me some?
C'mon, why not?  The Monkees had a show.  Look at all that other junk that's on TV.  We got underground cult following.
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
Look at my lips.
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
That can be done.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
We was coming to see you.
How you sound?
Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.
It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
My game is still strong.  No Viagra for me, don't need no chemicals. Just my tonic.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
So he drank himself into a stuper?
Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
Everybody shut up.
A gift.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
That's why it will be so much fun.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
No.
Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
Yes he did.
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
Soon.
This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
The one with da big...
That'll work.  I just bought one for myself.
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
We should go out on a double date.
...no, she didn't...
...yes she did.
...perfect...
...like macaroni and cheese...
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
Are you trying to rap to me?
Oh you do, huh?
And what?
Why don't you answer?
Good morning.
Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
I never was more in earnest.
It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
But how, sir?
Then you yield to me.
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
What is to be done?
May I be quite frank with you?
Yes, papa.
Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? No man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance.  For instance, I have got the gout; who tends me?  A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power.  My wife never comes near me.  What friend have I?  None in the wide world.  Men of the world, as you and I are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains.
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
What do you like then?
Okay.
Tell me about them.
Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some.
Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
But not Pike's.
No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week.
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
Your weapons, Sergeant.
I...
Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there --  Where's West?
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
You're the only one missing a grenade.
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Then who did?
I didn't do anything --
Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
Who killed Pike?
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
Not for me.
I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has --
You're drunk --
You're crazy --
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
Yes.
Why?
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
I lost a bet.
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
Get in.
Isn't this how your story goes?
Tough.
Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
Poor fucker my ass...
To start a fire, goddammit!  What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work --
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
He whispered it in my ear.
He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
We're not going anywhere.
Sir, yes, sir!
That's great.
Yes!
Yes.
Not yet.
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
I brought it.
No.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
You don't like it?
No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
True story.
It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
Dad?
Can we talk?
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.
Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
I'm robbing this place.
I do.
Did you?
They met at Auburn.
But it's not true.
You're not.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
No I don't.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
Such as?
Yes.
Uh... Yes.
He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm going to make him.
He wants the money from your bank.
Yes.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
Well as it turns out I did.
What? No you're not..
Yes.
I don't have any money.
I said I don't have any.
I don't want to talk about him.
But, you know, so what?
No. But you tend to tie them up.
I don't hate you.
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
You...
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
You don't understand you either.
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
Except for Small Eyes.
What was her name?
It's not mine either.
Thanks.
Just wanted to see.
This gonna get you in trouble?
Don't make it less true.
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean to say...  I got feelings for you. And I didn't want you to think... I didn't...  I don't want you to go away. There's better ways to say what I'm trying to say, but... they it is. Don't go away.
You seen my snake-skin shoes?
Hey.
Can I put it in your mouth?
Sit down, man. Need a beer?
You need a ride?
She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
Rose... please...
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
Don't need none.
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
I can handle that.
You drink whiskey?
Nothin'.
Looks like you know a song.
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
Word wit'cha. In private.
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
Meanin' like a team of fellas go to work on her and she don't even break a sweat.  She into football, you know. You got a letter on your jacket you get that pussy in ya lap. I ain't playin'.
Not like that.
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
Yeah?
Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'.
Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh?
I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today?
All that shit's on aisle 5.
Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
Beats forty hours on a plane.
Nick, we can't just --
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
I wasn't expecting you.
Give us a break...
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
A snitch?
You can trust me.
Nick --
Shut-up.
I want to go talk to him.
It's illegal, Nick.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
How many men?
We need the plate to negotiate with.
We can't lose.
I don't think so.
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
He drinks.
Why would you care?
This by this...
What...?  What if I say no?
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
Can we skip the poetry, inspector?
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
I want him.
If I say no?
He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.
You certainly have a nice place here.
If he won't cooperate?
That wouldn't be very sporting.
Why?
We've already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table.
No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together.
Hello, glad to meet you.
What was he after?
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
Yeah.
Who.
Yeah.  I got it.
Soon as I finish the job.
Okay, but...
But I would like to buy you drink.
No problem.
Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
Meaning?
Of course.
What's suck night?
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
Come on.
And who do I go to about you?
You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
So?
Can you?  I couldn't.
If they are smart, they take naps.
Don't be fooled by appearances.
What's up?
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
The machine works.  She is.
I'm tired of this.
Same thing.
Thanks.
Bravo!
For how long?
Well, that depends...
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
No, you get out of here.
No, I'm lost.
I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?
Right.
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
It's Perry!
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
You are one scary son-of-a-gun.
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Why not go to work for me?
Okay.
This is for me.
Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
I didn't know that.
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
No dogs, huh? Okay.
Two weeks.
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
Wow.
Good for you.
Uh...yeah.
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
Goodnight!
Is that what you call it?
Sing it to me.
Neat. Goodnight!
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
Yes, it is.
Nothing.
Yes.
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
How do I leave here?
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roulÈ!
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
These are really swell! I mean swell!
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
She's right?!
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
Yes. He likes windows.
I'm not wearing his pants.
Almost all of them.
The recovery is very impressive.
Amazing. I'm very impressed.
Goodbye.
And thanks for always being happy!
You don't look thirty-five.
How do you do, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Are you in trouble, son?!
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
I never know anymore.
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
I told you! I've got everything!
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Coming!
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?
I want him to at least see the sky!
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
We'll find him.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
Have him committed.
Um...uh...
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Yes.
Only you and the photo lab.
Yeah.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Then you got undressed.
No.
Yes.
You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
No. What is happening?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
Frank? Can you stand up?
No. I should go.
Please, please stay.
Hello.
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
I'm doing it.
Come on Dorothy.
He's comin' back? What for?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
From the neighborhood?  Shut the fuck up.  You like telephones? Huh? You wanta go for a ride?
Frank?
Yes, but.
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Nothing.
There ya go.
This is it.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
That sounds great!
Anyone else? Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
Where are they?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
Now, how are you going to do that?
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Why not?
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
Yeah.
Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
Did you see her undressed?
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
You didn't tell him about me?
Sandy, this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
I bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. And when you took the wheel, who was beside you?
The Duke?  What did you do?
Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
Well, I didn't but...
All right, I suppose you have the right ta know.
Know any other languages?
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
I'll call you tonight, afterwards. 
y-y-yeah that's what he said.
For what?
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
Yes.
He's a good man.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
Male or female, bitch?!!
The Sicilians.
Those doors were down... which means this. They looked down in through the peep hole, saw these guys and opened the doors from the inside. Pop, pop, pop, right through the glass. Why?
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
Twist of lemon!
Sweet-n-low!
Shit! Shit!
Who were the victims?
Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW!
Y'know it is, a bit.
So let's kill the motherfucker. I mean, what are you guys... like that's your new thing right?
It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
Yes.
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
Yes.
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
Open it!
That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.
What do you want me to say?
Just go!
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
Right. The blond guy.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
No, just do it real quick.  I'll meet you down there.
You think we're going to be chased?
Where's the other stocker?
Well, then cut it in half.
Look at the treads on those.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those.
We said 48 hours.
This morning.
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram.
I'm not. But there's --
Shut up!
No, Dignan. This isn't --
So do I.
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
Roger.
Take your second position.
It's going back down.
Applejack! What's happening?
Nobody move!
Careful. Check his pulse.
Come on, Kumar.
Yeah.
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
Yes, he did.
Me?
You could make your own cinnamon toast.
Let them fight.
Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
Why not?
Yes. You just got to stick with it.
Sixty days?
Nothing. I was just asking.
No.
Who's got the car keys?
Cuba.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
That's your friend Anthony?
You don't celebrate til it's over.
True.
Bob! Get back in position!
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
No.
They are.
Can you use a coaster.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
His name was Swifty?
That could be anybody's.
Bob, that makes no sense.
Good luck, since I got the keys.
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
Let's go!
Oh, yeah.
Yes.
Who? Applejack?
Where?
She Chicano, yes?
What?
Come on in!
What?
Pleasure to meet you, John.
There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her?  You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?
Well, whatever he's doing, I've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission.  I want the Berlin police fully briefed and --  -- get this out to all the agencies.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
The sooner the better.
Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
Yes...
You killed them.
Is this really happening?
Felt a little light.
How long? How long do I have -- 
But it ends up the same.
What?
Where are you going?
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
Get on it.
Abbott?
Pamela Landy, again. Where do we stand?
Am I a doctor, no, but...
Are you an expert in amnesia?
Some women like Dobermans --
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
He has already agreed to come.
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
I have ordered conscriptions...
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
Aye.
I don't want to be a martyr.
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
No. One of us is enough.
How many?
It's up to us, Hamish!
I wanna have supper waitin'.
Aye, we'll get 'em.
A patriot!
He will fight you forever. But what does he fight for? Freedom first, and peace. So grant them.
Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
Did it work?
You scare me.
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
...Tonight!
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
...I wouldn't know.
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it!
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
What is it?
Why? What for?
So what did you find.
Um... can dad come this time?
No.
Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.
You know my father?
Not in this wing, actually. No.
Yes.
I see a car.
But I... I need those books.
This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
What the fuck are you doing?
I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
Calm down, kid. Stand still.
Hey, I got no choice.
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
What happened?? Where are we?!
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
Sorry. Never heard of her.
Oh my God oh my God...
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
He always has.
You want my advice?
A champagne cocktail, please.
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
Come up here a minute.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
-- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.
Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?
Yes, something.
There are only two other alternatives for him.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
Uh huh.
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
It doesn't matter.
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
And Laszlo?
Oh, Rick!
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Does he always leave so early?
We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
Goodnight.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
Apparently he has the letters.
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
Rick? Who's he?
-- Is what?
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
I said, ask your wife.
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
But we made a deal.
No. It's all arranged.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
Are you quite finished with us?
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Good day.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
I see what you mean.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
Perhaps not.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
His escape.
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
He is traveling with a lady.
He'll take one.
Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
What friend?
Oh, he won't be followed here.
Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
I think perhaps you're right.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
-- Sacha, call a cab.
Hello Ugarte.
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
For how long?
No.
Boss, let's get out of here.
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
Worse than Warsaw.
Feels so good to lie here.
No water, no work.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
As much as anybody.
Yeah.  A long time ago.
I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled.
Had a package to deliver.
I've got lots of time.
Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.
I thought I did.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
You can't go now.
Hey...hey...it's okay!
What was inside?
I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does.
That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
I'm so glad you're alive.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Just don't count 'em before they hatch.
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
I'm touched.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
Want to see my raft?
Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
What?
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
No please, join me.  Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on.
It was just the ether, Wilbur...
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
One has to be more than "careful" of Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country! I'd like to give her a little ether.
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
I'm *not* a doctor!
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Candy. Candy Kendall.
"King Kong". It's really good.
I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Just a little privacy.
Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
She knows how to take care of herself.
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
But did you know him?
Did you know your mother better?
She looks after other people's children.
Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
Where are you going?
Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
And I *love* her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do!  I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that.
You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right?
Yes, for both.
I don't know it.
Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself "not a doctor"!  Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
Almost.
I don't like watching anyone be sick.
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.
You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
Sort of like a letter of intent.
And you have this letter of intent?
I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?
After you cut her loose.
She walked.
Guess so.
And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
So what? We just stay clear of him.
I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
How's that? He works for Gillette.
She's up for it.
Calls?
Minus one.
I apologize for the inconvenience.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Ring it for him, Sobo.
Something stupid.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
Sure.
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
Uh-huh.
Did I miss something?
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
It's more than that.
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
Everyone's working an angle, right?
What do you want? An apology?
He'll find us. We go talk to him.
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
I'm sorry.
Stand up.
Eee Oott Auught!
A little bit of both.
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
To who?
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
I despise the job.
Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it?
Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? "I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission." The shit!
Looking forward!
Good God, no. But with skill like that, what do you want a job for? You don't need to work.
I want to hear it.
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
Why not?
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
You will?
There was a message, wasn't there?
You're already alone.
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
I won't.  Goodbye, dad.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.
That's fine.
No, forget it. The bet's off.
Thank you.
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
Who did it? Tell me!
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Turn left at the lights.
She's my baby.
And the girls?
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
Rough life, Jack.
Five.
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
I hope it's not the oven again.
Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Where is the key?
Time to start talking.
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Fuck that shit.
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
I read the same here.
-- open quantum latches --
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
Arm yourself, bomb.
And I saw that I was alone.
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
Of course.
Exactly.
To explode, of course.
I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
I'll check it.
Out where?
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
Not now!
What happened, Doolittle?
What's that, sir?
Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
Sir?
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
That's not why we're here.
What the hell are you doing?
You're not still pissed?
Justine was not an unwilling participant.
She was there...
What?  Where're we going?
No time.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
I ain't mad at you...
I got overhead...
Can you help me get her back?
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
I was expecting someone else.
The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
Girlfriend?
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
Bent.
Yes on all counts.
Look, thank you for this but--
Zack... He made it... He's alive...
Can't help you.
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
No.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
Pull the cash.
Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.
Max--
--a philandering pig.
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
Okay, okay, okay--
I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
I have all your notebook doodles memorized, Jam... Here.
Yeah.
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
Plenty, but it was all bad.
YO, DOOFUS!
Check!
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
Sunday, but...
Curly.
Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
DUDES!
Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
What's gone?
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let us in then.
But, mom!
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.
I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.
You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
Hello summer detention.
All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
Look, you can have my wallet...
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
A metal craft of any kind.
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
Could these wormholes appear in nature?
You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
What did you say?
You have to do something for me first.
Take it off. I want to see you.
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.
Hey...
Fuck them.
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
Wonder where we'll be then.
And what?
What?
Are you okay?
Infant Memory Generators.
Hey. You OK?
Where is she?
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
All of this... certainly isn't your mother's fault, Donald.
I think he saved my life.
I think about girls a lot.
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
Do you feel alone right now?
Regret.
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
Guess who wrote it?
Because you tell Mom everything.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Gerald.
Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression... He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
How did you know --
It is a big deal.
What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism.
She's right over there.
Oh God, I'm dead...
Yeah, you betcha...
Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Huh?
Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
C'mere. I love you so much.
I love you much.
You heard me. Where is it?
Bitch!
Okay... well, bye.
Bye.
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
Oh, Christ, it's true.
I'll be right back. See ya later.
Anyone?
My dress'll reek.
Yeah.
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo, they love that.
Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much as it was a bake sale. Ah- hahahahahahahaha!
That's enough!
Oh, my!  Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?
Number one, American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers.
We need more bars!
"My President"...
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
Is that all?
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
All right -
Half watch dog?
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
What other job you got?
Then you don't wanna work hard?
In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
You get half mine and I get half yours.
Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
Then I demand an apology!
You told it to me.
I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
Sure, we gotta have a spy.  If we no got a spy who's gonna tell the other side what we're doing?
We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
Is that so?  I used to think you were two-faced - but you can't be - or you wouldn't be wearing that one. Now - let's talk this thing over.
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning.
Sure.
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
It must be done right away.
Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
Go ahead.
Yes.
Oh -- you mean... worm?
No... it was a seven letter word.
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
Two, please.
Oh?
What is it?
Right... Right.
He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry.
Yes, I think I can.
No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can.
Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
Nothing of any importance, eh?
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
You've never been?
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
Tell me about it, please!
That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
Ohhh...
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
Of course.
Yes, John.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
John.... how can you ever forgive me?
You too, my friend. Goodnight.
Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late, so please forgive me.
HE'S GONE!
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Never mind. I'm the owner.
I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
Who, Father?
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
I said welcome.
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
I've never LOVED anybody!
And the week before that?
Is it night or day, Erik?
That I cannot tell you.
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
But you don't want to hear it.
And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
What -- rape?
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
I didn't mean to!
Odin!
I don't know! I just did!
He wants to KILL us.
So? What'd you do to her?
I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.
Look out!
What is it?
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
She MUST have a knife or something...
The Dragon...
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
What have you got there?
Yes yes... of course.... the "Blacksmith's Code"...
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
Well... I... I thought...
I'm drowning! Help!
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
Easy, Dad!
Tell him I'm coming!
I never do...
I did. You said, things were fine.
Yeah, you told me that later.
You did? You liked me?
Why what?
Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
It's okay, really.
I like it.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
Huckleberry Hound?
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
That's okay.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
Wilmont. Near the high school.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
I'm just a bit of a wreck. "I sleep in your hat" makes me cry.  Me.
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
It's pretty.
No, I'm okay for now.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
No. I --
Yeah.
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
Yeah.
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
You're not ready.
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
Oh?
What do you mean?
Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
What?
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
I know.
Yeah, maybe.
Oh.
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
It's dark.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
I think we should go.
Yeah.
What if?
We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
I don't know. Panties and --
There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.
What? What do you mean?
Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
Well, what should we do?
How did I look?
What do you want, Stan?
Mary... please. This is hurting people.
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
Oh dear.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Clockworks.
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!
About...
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
Like what?
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
So now you're bummin' around?
I'm the best.
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me.
Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.
I don't know anything about it.
I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man.
I think I found something...
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
The containment, Second Containment...
Coffee.
Can you shut it down?
His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
Hear what?
90 over 50 and falling... .
His peritoneum has ruptured...
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
Some things you don't get over.
How do you know all this?
I'm going in.
Start the countdown.
Yes, sir!
Justin. I won't let you die.
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
What you got, Peters?
Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan...
Thanks.
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure...
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
It's 2041...
I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
Yes...
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
It's done.
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
What is that?
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
Come again, Skipper?
Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought.
But you can breathe it.
How much oh-two do we have?
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
What's causing the readings?
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
I've got a theory.
Justin's in the airlock.
Five seconds.
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
They attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue, flooded both ships with pure oxygen. There was a spark and both ships were incinerated. The Skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat. Captain Miller was able...
Not according to the computer.
Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
She's not ugly.
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
All boards are green, everything's five by five.
The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
How?
I'm alright. Please.
The forward airlock.
Victor did.
Oh, he did.
About me? How sweet.
Baby, you're scaring me.
You'd never know it.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
And they're changing into...
I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll notify the CDC and --
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
Ben! Ben!
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
I think that thing is Ben.
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
Front page?
Which was?
What...?  Oh.
I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
I'm sure I can come up with something.
The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
Of course.
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
It's the first door on your left!
This is how I dress all the time.
I take out the garbage.
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
I'm just guessing.
Why?
Ugh.
What a guy.
Sure. Come on in.
Well...
Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... I'm going to my room to change!
I don't know. It's getting pretty late...
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
You're crazy. Those girls love me.
Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
Naw. Any good?
This ain't no cop.
Do you think that guy's cute?
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
Really?
He was hot, wasn't he?
Believe it.
I know.
It was okay.
It was nice.
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
Listen to this... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.'
You're right. I didn't tell you that.
Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
What do you want?
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
Really?
Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
I don't know. I guess so.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
Aren't your parents asleep?
No. That's okay.
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Not for me.
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
Naked.
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
This is my granddaughter...
No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
Jesus! Did I say that?
The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
Not yet. I want to study its habits.
Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
I have to go.
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
What for?
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
Jesus.
It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
Lucy.
Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
NO! Stop talking like that.
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.
You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
Right.
I don't know, I just got here. Did you find your girl?
Nah, I got the gun.
But it's got teeth.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
Easy.
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
Oh yeah?
Yep.
Okay then.
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
He shot you the other time.
What do you mean what?
Four door?
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
MOVE YOUR ASS!
HELLLPPP!
Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
Nothing, just lookin'.
Whoa!
That's one piece of four problems.
Stop her!
Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
Putting on my armor.
I guess so, sir.
But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act.
I'd like nothing better.
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
I'm not!
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
You really want to go?
Of course.
And you think it's worth all this?
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know.
Please, Francie...
That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.
Why, you... you little bastard!
Not me. But other people seem to.
Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
How'd I look?
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
What's left of my blood.
Help yourself. Everyone else has.
Well... to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first. So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on. And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top... and there's nothing there. And you look behind you and there's no one below. You're just left there all alone... swaying in the god-damned breeze.
That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
You know, I've never been able to figure that out.
I live here.
You think I got it?
Mama, what's...
It's your fan mail, little sister.
What?
For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.
Not long.
At one. Promise?
Sure.
No!
And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
You're not going anywhere!
No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
But what -- 
Oh bullshit.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
Please sit down...
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
Normal. Average.
All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
Stay calm, please.
I'll have someone show you to your room.
Really? Any problems?
No! No!
Would you not? He was father. And mother. We fell from grace together. He from his God. I from mine.
People can be kinder than you think.
Materials. Nothing more.
You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
There is something I want.  A friend.
I'll be waiting. And watching.
A brain. Extremities.
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home to marry me.
It's far too late for him to still be out.
Father's so proud.
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
Why the change? What about your work?
It wouldn't dare.
Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny.
Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
You can't. Death is God's will!
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
No. They don't.
For what?
I didn't find what I was looking for.
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
How is it you come to be here?
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
Creature? A... human like creature?
Right! Right!
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life. It's been my whole life. Gimme a chance. Stay a week. Help get it ready. Next Friday, if you're not happy, I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful.
Well, it hasn't been that long.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
I need you so much, Claudette.
Where's Ned?
Ha! You wily oriental! The phone was "Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you." "What hath God wrought" was the telegraph.
I guess...
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
There you are dead wrong.
Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
Those things can be nasty.
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
I got to.
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
How much do I owe you?
Another coincidence.
Just my son and I.
Open the door. I'm coming aboard.
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.
Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.
I have no idea.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
Come again?
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.
She's dead?
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Yes, they do.
Why'd ya quit?
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!
You best better get it done, Pops.
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about "I don't believe in vampires" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires.
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, "Digayo." When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called "The Titty Twister." From what I hear, you can't miss it.
Daddy's dead.
Noooo!
-- you got your shower --
-- see this, television!
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
Knock yourself out.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
You callin' him a liar?
I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"
They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.
These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
-- This conversation is over.
Cops.
Didya look at the border?
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
Keep your voice down.
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man.  He's a preacher.
Just some of the women.
Don't say my name.
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what you can find.
What'd you find, Kathy?
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Did you just have a brain-fart?
Same rules for everyone, sir.
You'll get everything you want, O'Neil.  Let's see if you want what you're gonna get.
Sir?  What did he say?
Entering my scan now...
Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case in point...
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
I'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr. Hayes.
I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this morning myself -- and told him the deal was off.  No more test cases. He was only too happy to oblige.  Don't play politics with me, little darlin'.  You'd be up way past your bedtime.
It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
You're wanted at the C.O.'s.
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not?
So dump on me.
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
I don't know, I don't care.
What?
If you got a good one, Wick...
They had to kill 'em?
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist?  How dumb you gotta be? That's exactly what they --
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?
It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.
Wasn't deemed a threat.
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
Women.
I don't know.  Seems...
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
Yeah. Why are you asking?
But we can get to the west side faster.
You must have quite some harem.
It's good to see you, Nick.
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
Yes. Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time!
I was wrong.
I left my forgery kit back at the office.
Where's Luc and Pierre?
Have them sealed off.
You're fast.
Follow me.
What are you suggesting?
That thing's dead. What the hell are we waiting for?
Thanks.
We, have already taken care of them.
I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.
It's Raymond.
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Is that the bathroom?
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
THIS much.
KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
The ships are gaining...
We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
We'd never have the budget for this.
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
Lt. Madison, GO.
It's fractured...
All systems are working, Commander.
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
OK!
I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
Your last name.
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
No. Keep all energy to the armor.
Where'd they go? Back inside?
Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING.  Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING...
No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
Will you stop RIDING ME?!
Yes. Yes, I'm here!
Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.
What the hell are you talking about?
Wait... Jason, Here!...
TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
We pretend...
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
And determination.
Push It. Hold it down.
I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal...
What does she see in them?
Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
Exceedingly.  Besides, if I had half the wagons that were used to lug the rum to Philadelphia for this congress, I could move a whole army to the moon!
Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
Yes, my lord.
No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant.  Then, they start coming back to us.
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
No one knows...
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
I don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  And, if he's popular with his men...
I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief.
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
But, general, I assure you my motives are sincere.
I... they look both the same.
I will continue with our French allies, concentrating on New York.
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
I think I heard that.
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.
You know, I came back to Mount Vernon to retire.  I don't need to be in government.
That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!
Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
Who says so?
This, this is life indeed!  Life worth preserving, Such life as Juba never felt till now.
Juba was a Numidian.
So where's the money?
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
The money. Fuck. I gotta think...
No shit? What're some of 'em?
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
Who is this?
Depends. Who's this?
Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
Ray. Look at me.
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
I don't like waiting.
I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
Get him out've here.
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
So you don't work for the casino?
Harry, look at me.
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
You don't even know these guys.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
Yeah, Chili. Hi.  You're fifty feet in the air!
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
We talk different?
One we're producing.
Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.
You're not going to tell me the rest?
I'm up twelve grand today.
Who told you that?
How? By taking my money?
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
Sit down, Leo.
How much is the wife offered?
What're you doing here?
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
Sounds fair.
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
Shylock?
Really.
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.  Over.
Roger that, North Island. Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over and out.
We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.
Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Gimme a break.
Oh yeah.
Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
Three, four days.
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
I think you better see this for yourself.
Not me.
What?!
What the fuck -- ?
There's a charming thought.
I feel fine.
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
So what did happen?
You think she's sailing without a crew?
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
Wish I could say the same.
Showing you what?
Right here.
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
Over the gold.
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
You don't remember?
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
Twenty. You knock off twenty and then we see. After my guy looks at it.
Who?
About what?
Yeah, I heard about that.
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
Hello...
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you.
So, where's "Weird Al"?
But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
Shut up!
We should follow them!
What does that even mean?
You can have that one.
What is this?
I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.
No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine.  There! Look at her!
It's still twenty-five minutes early.
I can't believe it!
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
Somewhere downtown.
It'll only take a second.
I didn't get it either.
Anthony's II!
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
Oh my god, I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase...
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
Nothing.
When was this?
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
That's all you're bringing?
Maybe an orange juice.
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.
I thought it wasn't for sale.
Norman.
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
You're late, asshole.
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
Jesus!
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
Shh!
These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
Jesus...
Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
That's the spirit!
Really?
Oh yeah?
Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
So, what happened?
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
Does that mean you don't like me?
No, of course not.
In what way do you mean?
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
Yeah, sure. Of course.
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
So where would we go?
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
Right.
Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. Who knows? It could be a million things. It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure.
I am.
Right, exactly!
Why? What did she tell you?
I have no idea - I just want to...
What fake blind date? What are you talking about?
You're right. The Devil has come. Look at me. I am the Devil.
Well, I need to speak to him.
What have they done besides kill Starling?  How many have they killed? 
I'm calling it my "contraption"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door.
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
We have hunted since childhood.
That is correct.  Nothing.
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
That's what the books say... 
Got me out of trouble.
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this-  -they're doing it for pleasure.
Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night.
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
You think they'll come then?  Why?
Because I think they're after you.
I do, actually; very much.
You give me hope, John. 
Four should do it.
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
Help finish the railroad.
Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
We don't have a relationship.
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.
Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
Okay.
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again.
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
I await the word of Vigo.
Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
Did I forget something?
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in.
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Who?
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
What?  Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
So what do you think it was?
No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
Nothing.  Is that the kitchen?
Well, let's check it out.
That's it.  Get out.
I'll scream.
Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel, I think.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
In the physical sense.
That's so romantic.
Oh, really?  Well, I've quit better jobs than this one, believe me.
I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
Close -- but definitely wrong.
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
I'm always serious.
It's hard to explain, but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension.
You have to keep him there.  Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave,  He could be very dangerous.
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
She said he was "the Destructor."
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Where are you, Pete?
Third floor.  Get down here,
How do you know?
No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
I am their hero!
On what charge?
I'm serious.
Give away food?
I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
I am prepared to write anything you tell me.
The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!
God of passages and changes?
Yes!  The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate are over -- thanks to your father!  Now report to the Senate, Master Galen:  what is Marcus' state?
Only from a distance.
Sneaking around with your brother?
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
They fear me.
What deal?
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
That's what I'm going to do.  That's what I'm going to do...
Death is a very light thing for you.
Death is... everything for me.  Now you have to go to your cell, and I to dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well.  I want you to be fit as you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow!  I want all my gladiators to win and be happy!  Besides, I've never owned a Roman general before.
I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
It's absolutely not like that!  This is for your own good!  Come on get the rest of your armor on!
No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
No.
No.
But could I just tell you this one thing?
All right.
Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
I've never been to it.
Here? In Berkeley?
Here he comes.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
Is it because I'm here?
Did you say rape her?
But you might.
Yes.
Not exactly.
What for?
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
Where are you?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
A room. I'd like a room, please.
What? No. Nothing.
What?
Whatever you say, sir.
Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.
No.
Pardon?
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Sit down.
All right. Now finish your drink.
Yes.
Oh. Well, goodnight.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
Would you like me to seduce you?
On that chair in the hall.
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
Yes -- I think that would be good.
Yes?
A hanger.
You're welcome.
This is all terribly wrong.
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
Who said it was my first time?
That you're afraid --
You walk right out the door.
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
Thank you.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
Not exactly.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
What was your major?
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
Don't talk about Elaine?
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
I wouldn't know.
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
Are you?
Now don't start this.
But it's not.
But if it's sickening for you --
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
Thank you.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all.
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
Very good, sir.
Yes, but I'm afraid --
No, I do. I want to tell you.
Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
No.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
Different.
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
What?
How long have we known each other now?
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
I will.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
I am not threatening you.
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...
Yes?
Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it.  Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the -- 
Need any help?
Why?
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
How?
You might find a bullet through that head...
If you did that, you'd get nothing except the police after you. If you wait -- I'll give you your six thousand back --
Oh -- work!!
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Aren't you?
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
Why do you hide in my room?
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
And...?
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
Just for a minute then.
You are beautiful!
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
And what do you do -- now?
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
I --
Why later?
No?
They've brought me such good luck -- you --
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
Oh, a Baron! 
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
We could come to my room.
Ready, Baron.
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
I thought she was splendid!
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
Yes, I was in the war.
Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
Oh!
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
Fourteen thousand marks... One can travel -- one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks -- don't you think so, Baron?
Yes -- and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink.
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
Yes -- that --
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
Oh -- what -- what -- 
Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
Money!
No -- only occasional jobs. 
You pay me.
Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
Skiing? 
Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.
Yes.
I must go to England -- at once.
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
You're sweet.
You think so?
Here, hold up!
Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning? -- Have we cigars -- water and everything?
Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.
All you have to do is phone for it.
Yes --
Preysing, you're joking with us.
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
Oh, yes, Suzette.
Madam will dress now, it is late.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
Such nonsense.
You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end. 
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
Yes, Pimenov.  One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
You say that you are employed by us in Fredersdorf, and here you are in Berlin, indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means -- Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, I think we will look into your books.
Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
Good night.
Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does it. Goodnight.
You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
My son was in the hospital --
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
What's that, Lilly?
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
Not much time.
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
Well, make it stop!
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
Oh, sure. Fine.
Perk.
Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...
Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.
They twisted my arm.
Thanks, uh, Lilly.
He let me live. He let me be his friend.
No. That was the point.
As though you do what I say.
I know you do, so that's why --
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
No, I guess not. It was pretty lousy of me, I guess, to be a child at the same time you were. Not to stop being a child just because I had a child. I guess I was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up.
A future. The only future I've got.
Always, for you, baby.
Mm?
You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
Is that right?
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
Open your door.
Maybe I like it where I am.
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
Bullshit!
That's natural.
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
Well, let's get the shock over with.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
I think someone broke into my house.
I came to see you.
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
It's always John.
What?
What?
I thought you were allergic to latex.
Shit, Linda!
You're so easy...
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
He's in the bathroom.
Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
Danny, you're just going to have to wait!
I promise.
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
Here.  Let me try.
'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
But surely Rogers isn't --
After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
Why did you take Jamie?
And I'm its deliverer.  Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it. Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.
I dunno, boy.
I suppose.
Must have changed that law.
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
Go home!
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap.
It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
He's a man.  Tell him you're a man.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
I wanted to apologize.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
Oh my God--  And you are Looseleaf Harper.
Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
That can be arranged.
You're making a joke.
Life has denied me that thrill.
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
College!
They were in the same creative writing class.
He insults him all the time.
Dad was never in England?
"The sting."
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
Sir?
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
Damn.
Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
No.
Gee whiz, Dad--
I'm talking to you gently now.
Yeah.  But it's going to get loud again.
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
Give us time.
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
We thought a doctor might help.
Do say hello to your mother.
Then let me see him go out and get some exercise.  Right now!
You're a woman, aren't you?
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
The doctor.
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
It seems highly intelligent to me.
I plan to live one hundred years!
I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
You startled me.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
Are you've seen it work cures?
Oooooo.  That hurt.
I'm high as a kite.
I love you!  Have a cigar!
Cut me open.  Find out.
Poison.
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
The new hero is you.
I'm going to shoot you now.
My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
No.
It's trash now, like mine.
What are you going to do?
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
It was a bitch.
I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
She did?
What will you do, Colonel?
That is sad.
You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
What a relief!
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
Stay home tonight!
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
He's a ghost!
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
Thank you, kind sir.
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
What's his name?
Don't know.
Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
Yeah.
I'm glad.
If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
Is he all right?
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
Marry me instead.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
We made the date three months ago.
I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines?
Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
We've got to rescue him.
Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
You'll be fine.
Are you going to stiff me?
What do you mean?
'Film Producer seeks young men, 18 to 25, for hardcore film. Prior film experience a must. Call Jake at Players Motel. 777 Vine. 463-5671.
That's Charity. She's out back. She'll be free in half hour.
Yes. I think it'll look better.
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
Tod might know.
Something like that. How much do you make?
Three hundred?
Huh?
A friend.
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
Say what?
No.
Fuck.
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
More or less.
I thought I was fucked up.
It's not quite the same thing.
Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.
Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
Where is he, Niki?
You are.
And better?
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
There's a little stall theatre up here.  It's closed now, but I'm borrowing it for an hour. I think there's something you'd better see.
The police? They know less than you do.
I hate it. But you gotta know, buddy.  A lot of strange things happen in this world. Things you don't know about in Grand Rapids. Things you don't want to know about. Doors that should never be opened. I've known more about this sort of thing than a man should. Don't ask me why.
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
I'll come with you. Let me pack some things.
You should come around more often. You haven't been around for weeks. Anne complains she doesn't see you anymore.
I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
Yeah.
No.
They're all about the same. You want something?
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
He asked me. You going with anybody?
I'm off that case. He fired me.
Do you really think Kristen is just a runaway?
Who's that?
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
Yes, I am.
Because if you are...
I don't know.
I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.
Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
Well then.
Oh, at the dentist's?
Promise?
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
Yes. Very much.
It was my last. I then became infatuated with these -- my "Odorifics."
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
Because they are all the same.
Well...
Is he all right?
What is that he's working on?
The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
I don't know.
Well, I really don't smoke.
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
It's so blue.
Oh.
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
But they have.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
Oh, you weren't scared.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
Well, they're my species.
Yes. They're old friends.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
A sunflower?
You don't care! "Miss Shroud of 1890 Weds the Boy of a Thousand Deaths!" Listen to me...
Harold!
No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
Yes. It does.
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
No.
Yes.
No.  I'd have liked to.
Perfectly lovely. You know, this is what we're defending. Everything that's good and beautiful in the American way of life. Oh, there's some nut peace petitioner over there. Let's go off this way. Those crazy Commie bastards. I don't know why we tolerate 'em. Parasites.
Well, I don't...
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Crazy parasite! Commie bastard! Get out of here.
Yes.
Then I suppose it was me. Get in, Harold.
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
What is it?
Oh, I'll bet you have.
No. It's not.
I thought you liked being on TV.
Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
Me?? C'mon --
Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
No. Don't --
Oh-n-no -- I --
Nah, sounds too "needy."
No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
Marco...
I know.
Lucky man.
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
You did this before, right?
No.
This isn't happening.
One last time. Give me the box.
Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
I don't want to see the dress.
I'm very happy.
Oh my God.
What happened to you?
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
One more. Maybe two --
A box?
Let me see.
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
Yes. They'll never find us.
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
The keys are in the kitchen.
I was here this afternoon.
Like who?
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
No. I'm not.
Why not?
Plain soda?
I'm already way over my usual limit. You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years.
What's wrong?
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
Sure.
Maybe you should give it some time.
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
Finished?
He's gone.
No. It's all over.
I have to get out.
What do we do if there isn't?
Are you alright ?
If I make it through the day.
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
We'll do it next Monday.
Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
Oh, so what's the point then?
What am I missing?  What do you have to be happy about?
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
Oh come on, Rob.  What am I, an idiot? I'm more bothered by Dick's thing. How did this happen, Dick?  What rational explanation can there possibly be?  What's her name?
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
We're getting that anyway.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?
I have all of the others.
Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes.
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
I'll start with your news before I tell him mine, obviously.  Mine isn't much, really, just about Marie LaSalle  playing at Lounge Ax tonight.  I like her, you know, she's kind of Sheryl Crowish... but, you know, good.  So I'll tell him before that. Good news and bad news kind of thing.
I want a tape.
Marie LaSalle is in the store!  Here, she's here, and now!
You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
Think about it, Rob.
But don't you remember?
What, what?
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
Of course it is.
I don't know.
Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
Great... That's great.
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
I guess.
Will you call me?
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
You don't ever think about other people?
Ray.  I hate Ian.
Mmm hmm.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
Oh ho, so very infrequently.
Hey, how ya doin'?
I can't talk right now.
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
You're also an idiot.
I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
I don't want to go back.
What do you want to do?
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
Okay.
You know the difference.
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
To make you feel better.
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
WHAT?
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
Right.
No.  Probably not.
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
What difference does it make?
Yup.
Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
God, you ask a lot of questions.
That way.
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...
I knew this was going to happen.
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
Well I don't know what happens now, apart from you meet someone, you move in, she goes.  You meet someone, you move in, she goes.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
Seventy-five.
Naw.  Those are for us.
Records are those big round black things, right?
Nice.
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The young lady just couldn't make it through labor.  Never even saw her son.
Would you remember his name?
I thought it might be a nice break from all of this.
A little dusty.
Yes.
That's impossible.
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
You killed those other two.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
Don't be stupid, lady.  Your neck can be sliced as fast as anyone else's.
It's that important?
What are you doing man?
But you lived.
Aye.
You know me home.  Me name.
I don't understand.
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
Go to hell.
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
I do not think I like the sound of that.
It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
Kiss me.
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
So sure?
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
We need more time.
Mulet.
It can be different.  It must be.
It never changes, Major.
Thanks.
Yeah.
We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
Any other I.D.s come up?
No.  I want this to be all ours.
I don't know.
None of this would be happening if you hadn't run...
It is the gathering, my friend.  The settling of old scores.
Offered the Pope one of his whores.
I do hope she enjoys a good show.
Leave her out of this.
He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week.
What are you getting at?
Home.
He's mistaken.
You're a kind man to be sure.
When may I expect the cleaners?
Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
Open this door!
I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!
Out of the mouths of babes.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
What home?
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
No, I can't.
Just what I said. That's what I --
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
Well, haven't you got anybody else?
No!
Where'd you meet this man?
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
Hanging an innocent man to win an election!
Who did you talk to?
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy.
What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
Walter!
I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.
Sure, I can. Look at the policy I gave him!  "With this ring I thee wed and with all my worldly goods I thee endow: And thereto I plight thee my troth."
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
Take that mush out of your mouth!
He's on my phone. He just called me.
You said it!
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Three bullets! Any good?
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun.  Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?
Three sixes. Is that any good?
Now, where is he?
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
What?
With a bag of marshmallows.
If there was any way out...
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
What did you do with her?
Phone for you, Hildy.
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone.
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
There's somethin' funny going on around here.
Never mind! Just play dead.
How much do you make a week?
The what?
No, I don't think so.
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
I know.
Why?
Very well, Grandpa.
You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
Yes, she did, didn't she?
Who told you that?
Sod.
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
Bugger the Buffs.
Jam.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
No, I won't.
Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
I wish it could all have been different.
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
OK.
Is your brother ready to go?
You sure do a lot of guessing.
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
That's not something to joke about.
I was just wondering.
Yeah, no shit.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
Yeah.
Then the devil says, "are you gay?" Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says, "Well then, I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."
Really fucking awesome.
Cat fight, cat fight.
Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
That food...  ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
There's a dog in the road.
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
Yeah, he's all hot on her after he found some of his dad's old nudie books hidden in the basement. He keeps 'em taped inside his school workbook.
Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
That's nice.
Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters.
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
Why?
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
Well, just promise me you'll be careful... alright, alright see ya soon... good-bye.
I can't believe...
Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.
Yes, sir.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
Great.
Enough with the stupid voices.
I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before...  ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?
What should I do?
Right.
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
I pray to God there is.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
And think about what you've done.
Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up.
Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union.  I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you.
Oui.
Oui, doctor, oui.
Oui.
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy while you are here.
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
That would be good.
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.
You are sweet.
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
It's okay, Puff.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
Yeah. My brother told me.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Please, honey, let me in.
You've got to respect that.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
I'm not sure.
Why certainly!
Of course.
A deer?
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl!
I had sold my fucking soul.
Thank you very much for that.
So he's doing okay?
Lila?
I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
Got it.
No.
You look different... More relaxed.
Packard. Sarah Packard.
Lots of action. Lots of money.  Lots of class. You'll see some of the best-dressed and most beautiful women in the world at the races. Knock your eye out.
Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?
That's right, Miss Packard.
To win.
Sit down.
Deal.
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
So I got talent. So what beat me?
A thousand.
I told you. I got drunk.
Thanks for the drink.
Thinking about what?
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I'm finished.
They're fine.
I said we're leavin'.
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
What do you want me to do, huh? What do you want me to do? Just say it and you got it but PLEASE don't get off me now.
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
Talk to me, Charlie.
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
What for? To play Fats again?
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
Is that what you think?
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
Bert, I believe Mr. Felson's making a proposition.
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Yeah. You must come again.
Oh man, you're way out of our league.
Heads.
Yeah, I'm quittin'.
How long have you been waiting?
Since four.
Fair.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
No.
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
Why should I?
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
Why?
I'm a little tired.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
You name it.
You lived like this once.
Have you looked inside?
What's inside?
It was at Diane's party in Malibu and I had just broken up with Todd and I was loaded for bear, any man who had the nerve to come at me -- watch out.  So you come sauntering in -- you know that saunter you do. That watch out, baby, here comes Mr. Smooth thing.
Please.
You got that right.
Let's check it out, Dad.
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
What did it look like?
It was -- it was -- it changed shape. First it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.
First lemme look at your necks.
I left it at work.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
'Cause he wouldn't lie.
If we go and look and there's nothing there, you'll have to admit to me that this is all in your mind.
But it's not, Jimmy.
Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
Who are you calling?
The State Police.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
Oh?
What's his family background?
They're from out of state.  Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
Huh? Oh, good, good.
Haven't you been watching?
Not really...
I'm thinking.
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
What'd I say?
And get those helicopters away from the ship. Call them back immediately.
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
Well, er... it's slowing down.
It's... slowing down, Sir.
He's doing a good job.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
Be careful.
Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy.
Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
We're leaving.
Above American soil?
Peace? No peace.
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
Papers, sir. Got it here.
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
Did you say...? Uh, uh...
I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!
Dad was onto something here!
Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.
My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
You could be more right than you know.
Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?
Find something?
He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
Mine, too.
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
All I have to do is scream.
I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
What final challenge?
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
What about Marcus?
Dad, how can you?
Ready.
Who are you?
I don't need camels.
Where's my father?
The British worry so about their Empire -- it makes us feel like well- cared-for children.
Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The British Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.
You think so?
It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
You should have been there...
Oh -- good. And maybe the present Maharajah is a little younger? And thinner?
There are no stories anymore.
I think that's enough of this nonsense, Dr. Jones...
Yes, I understand.
Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!
Okey-doke, Indy! Hold onto your potatoes!
Okay, Shorty.
It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
That's it. Pankot Palace.
You don't like him do you?
Legend says that when the stones are brought together the diamonds inside of them will glow.
What evil?
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
And it had three lines painted across it?  The lines represent the three levels of the universe. I've seen stones like the one you lost.
Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
Oh yeah?
That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too...
A SNAKE!!
It's pulling me deeper!
What?!
PET IT??!!
Oh really?
Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
No -- real food.
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
Quiet!
You've got to go to sleep now.
No... they won't kill me.
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
Don't do that.
It wasn't him.
I just got here.
Where are we?
Why don't we go home?
Do me a favor, Al.
No.
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
You're gonna explain.
Why he's argumentative?
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
Then what are you stopping for?
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
What am I supposed to do?
You're out of shape.
Don't just stand there, say something.
Where are you staying?
Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
What glasses.
Just hold them close and stay still.
She's the toughest to read.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
Not her. You!
What is it?
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
Shit! You're in love.
Why don't you get out of my face.
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
Too late.
Never mind, just say it.
Probably.
I was afraid of that.
Just say the words. Just like I told you.
Where?
I can't handle that thing.
Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
...Shit! It's just money.
The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
Dieter!
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
Works like a charm when I use it. You didn't say it right.
Don't give her your name.
Rene?
I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
They took the tapes.
What?
Oh.
You may not remember things.
What things?
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
Been hearing voices.
I noticed you staring.
Sir?
Then who did?
I didn't say anything.
...I'm looking for someone.
Yes?
Oh...I can't. Business.
I waited for you.
...and sort of...disinterest.
I am sort of scattered.
If I was with you, I wouldn't
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
You did.
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
I'm just on vacation.
We're very close.
Hiroshima.
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.
Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
You've  been there?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
I've never met anyone like you.
Escape.
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
You are, I've seen you.
He told me what to do.
I told you, I work for him.
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
Thanks.
Why not?
It is?
Ahhh...Okay?!!!
The other working.
What about Al...
Yes, baby?
You better take a good look! Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak?
Lowell?
How long?
I'll be there.
Push it.
Yeah. Catch you later.
...fuck is this? Fuck!
Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
Before you go...
How grave?
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
How are you, Jim?
What do you need at the store?
Soy sauce...
No, thank you.
Where should I wash them?
What's the difference...
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
I'll call you then.
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
Don't interpret that!  Hold it. Hold it. Hold it! Slow, slow!!  Sheikh, do you mind... if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face Mr. Wallace?
Yeah, well, questions will go toward what work you did there, why you were fired. And others will deal...
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
Good. I want to talk to you.
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
...okay.
It's okay.
Why?
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
ABC Telemarketing Company.
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
Liane has filed for divorce...
Where you staying now?
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
Yeah, I know you do...  You know, I came up through sales. One of the reasons I was a great salesman, was I never made a promise I couldn't keep.  I knew that if I ever broke my promise I'd suffer the consequence...
He --
-- we realized we'd always been very attracted to one another.
A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
Excuse me?
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
No...
I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.  Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?
Grounds?
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
No frown lines.  New watch?
What?
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
Asian? No.
Well... I'm still...
You have the pre-nup?
What?
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
So, that's good, right?
I said yes.
I'll be right back.
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
Thank you.
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
You look like you were a very sensitive child. You have expressive eyes.
Oh right. You met Patricia.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU.
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
I want to nail you ass.
That's marriage.
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
Hello Miles.
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
I thought so.
He was right, wasn't he?
Do you know him?
I'm dying.
Hello Miles.
Yes?
You ruined my life you sonofabitch. Gimme those.
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
And she had private investigators assisting her.
What the fuck...?
Berry spoons.
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
Do you have it?
The Judge is here. Over here, Judge Munson.
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
Muriel Rumsey.
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
Oh, no, sir. No different than—
"I found a million dollar baby—"
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
Do you love her?
South America.
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'm—I'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questions—I—  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
Fine man to fall in love with.
Been sending her meals in regularly?
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that—
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
They're practically all the same, sir. 
They're the finest detective agency in the country, sir.
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New York—and if we didn't go, she might lose it.
No.
Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
Oh—the papers—
Well—of all the—well—  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
I found it on the seat.
You're not going to notify my father, are you?
If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. 
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
Beat it! 
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Listen, Brat—I'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself.
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old woman—a trip like this.
Yes.
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
No.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride—
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it.
Oh, Peter— 
I don't want it now.
Carrots.
Uh-huh. Want one?
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him—
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
I love you.
You bet I did.
A headline? You're not a newspaper man, are you?
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
Get out!
Just your imagination.
Yeah!
How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
Yeah.
Huh?
What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this office—unless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. 
When you get through with that, I'll have a beard down to my ankles. 
Get out!
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
Zeke.  Git!
Hey, you!
There's a seat over there for you.
Yeah. Come on—come on!
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
Orange, New Jersey.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
"Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November 22-23.  Information received by the Bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate President Kennedy on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc, etc..."
Street cats?
Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young fags, you know.  They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up?  These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
I couldn't be more serious, Jack. Those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty.
Yeah, I guess you do.
I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
With whose testimony?  Willie O'Keefe? A male prostitute.  Jack Martini?  A drunk?  Vernon Bundy?  A dope fiend. Shaw's got respect, the newspaper editors, the American Bar Association - they're not...
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
Who gives a shit what he calls himself?
No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim. 
Why?
...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that?
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
Why?  What's wrong?
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
And Shaw?
Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
I know.
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
Nonsense.  What next?
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
Mr. Shaw, have you ever been a contract agent with the Central Intelligence Agency?
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
A man just called.  He asked her everything!
I don't think so, Jim...
You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
One shooter.  One spotter on a radio. Maybe three teams.  I'd say these were professional riflemen, chief, serious people.  Hunters...  patient. It takes skill to kill with a rifle, that's why there's been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years... "3-2-1...  green!"  Or else "Abort!  Abort!"
Boss, then I'm afraid I can't continue working with Bill.
If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
Honey, another one of these.  This one's as weak as cricket pee-pee. Yessir, you mark my words, Jim, Vietnam's gonna cost Johnson '68 and it's gonna put that other varmint Nixon in - then watch your hide, 'cause there ain't no offramps on a freeway to Hell!
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
...and your General?
Ever ask him?
There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair - I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know - like a society guy.  Can't remember his name.  Oswald was with him.
Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
Uh-huh.
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
Look, man, I know I owe you --
What time do you have to be there?
Arrest me.
What's in it?
Take your time.
Fine.
Okay.
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
It was the other guy who busted me.
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
'76?
He told me last night.
No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
She's adorable. But I had to end it.
I go back to work tomorrow.
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
He was here?
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
Has he hinted around?
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
In a dress.
Tell him I want to give him his money.
What's he doing?
I told him I might.
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
You ever see him sell guns?
No.
How can you help us?
What for?
What's her story?
She didn't say.
Uh-huh.
Yes. All those things are true.
But you didn't do that.
Not in the fitting room.
What about me?
What about you?
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
Dreaming.
And what was your answer?
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
Talk to you tomorrow.
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
What did they say?
I don't know. One of your friends.
But you don't?
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
Plus the same deal as before.
I can do that.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
Four days ago.
No thanks.
I thought you were sixteen.
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
Detroit.
...and just take it from him.
Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
Whatcha watchin'?
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
I dunno.
The moon -- I dunno
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
C'mon in.
I'm in my underwear.
That was Beaumont.
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
Pretty sure.
Well, if you had to do it, you had to do it. What we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. Anybody but that woman.
Came outta where?
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
Maybe the Feds got it.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
They don't have your winning personality.
You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.
Haven't a clue.
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.
What?
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
What does she do for you?
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
How the fuck did he find me?
And you did that to protect my interest?
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
Yeah.
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
He's around.
I'm alive.
There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
It's all been a dream.
What do you want?
There's nothing to expose.
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason here?
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch, okay?
How long had that been going on?
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
What did she have to say?
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
I've seen it. It's all pain.
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
It's not healthy with it closed.
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
She was good in bed, though.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
No. Don't move me.
Where are you?
What do you mean?
Don't ask.
Where'd you leave 'em?
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
What's wrong?
When was the last time I said a word?
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't stand around waiting.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
What kind of man are you?
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
What?
Why didn't you call me?
I want to know. You tell me!
I can do anything I want.
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
I can waitress. I'm good.
Please.
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
You can have anything you want.
Sit down, Jake.
Goddamn you!
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
Who then?
It's strong stuff.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
Yeah, you and everyone else.
They're awfully heavy.
Push 'em back.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Help me!
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
That's a lie. My family was here.
I work in a bakery.
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
Oh God. I know. I know.
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
Died?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
Delongpre! Out of time!
Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
What are you doing back?!!
Thorgan, suit up.
You're a teacher.
I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
Not a chance.
Where is he?
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
Give me a break! What happened?
Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
You'll be fine.
Did you like it?
I get it.
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
He's right behind us!
You lost the charge?
NO!
Thank you.
You're leaving me here alone?
Kay-em 14.
Are there any other shuttles?
Blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab. And look at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!
In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved their facilities underground to escape . . .
Sory...
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
I love you.
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
More soldiers?
Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
And incidental damages, if any...
Try some of this. I made it myself.
He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
Who's driving the boat?
We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
Probably out in the back yard.
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
Thank you.
I didn't agree to that!
August! Tomorrow is the 4th of July, and we are going to open for business. It's going to be our best summer in years. If you're so concerned about the beaches, you two, you do whatever you have to to keep them safe, but with you or without you, the beaches stay open this weekend.
I don't know if I can do that without a...
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
Be careful, for chrissake.
No shark did that to a boat!
That means closing the beaches.
Think the tide's with us?
Some friends and me took a house.
Pretty stiff.
That wasn't funny.
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks...
Who's inside, you or the shark?
Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
Let it go, don't waste your time.
Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!
Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
He's under!
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
Is that normal?
Oh. That's a relief.
Were we together?
It does?
Can we make out now?
Yup.
I don't really know anything about it.
Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
Cool it.
The term "deliver" is so weird. Can we not say "deliver"?
Wow, dream big!
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
We definitely want it to have junk.
Hey, I like this.
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
You're something else.
Why? What the big deal?
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
Oh man, I can just picture you slow dancing like a dork!
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
Really? Fingernails?
You found us in the Penny Saver?
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
Juno MacGuff.
No thank you. I'm off sex.
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
Dad, no!
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
Or...
Dude, I'm pregnant.
It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
It was magnificent, man!
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
Right, seriously.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
I want to be a mommy so badly!
They're yellow.
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
What?
Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
I don't know. Wish I did.
Turkey mostly.
How much do I owe you?
Henry Lucas.
Now why is that?
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
Ain't you goin' to record it?
Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
If you say so.
...Ha.
Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
Thanks. What are you doing?
Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember?
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
Shut up Carrie, please... just shut up!
Not yet.
She wasn't feeling so good.
Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job.
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
What do you mean?
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
Did you tell her that you loved her?
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
Probably.
You got any money?
Right.
No, I'm serious man. I'm dead ass. Do you wanna try? We could be like the fuckin X-rated "Wonder Twins"!
He looks like my uncle.
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
Yeah.
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
Why I give pennies?
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
Yeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs.
Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.
Why not? You stink.
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
Where you goin' tonight?
You goin'?
What?
What the fuck yo? You wanna catch a beat down?
Right now?
Hold on.
Yeah.
She won't? Why not?
Yeah?
Of course I do.
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin' maybe.
A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Yeah?
Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too.
I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!
I only did it once and...
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
It's like...
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
Holy shit. That's all true?
Yep.
Yes.
You are!  I don't like you.
What?
Let's see how much he wants to play.
No it wasn't.
Homesearchers.
Run it down.
What was your relationship with her?
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
Find him!  I want to talk to him.
Maybe you're reaching a bit?  I think Sanderson should be in on this. There's a reason why the killer's calling him.
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
What was suspicious about him?
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective.  You can't possibly be unbiased.
Who is this?
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
Very nice speech, Peter.  Did you rehearse that, or was it impromptu?  There's an old wooden bench in the garden.  Next to it is a rock.  You'll find a message for you under it.  Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are.
Very good.
You sonofabitch!
No you haven't.  And even if you had it doesn't matter.  Who would you tell? The police don't believe you, and you've just used your only phone call.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
I know, but this isn't going to bring her back.
You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
I just can't believe it.
You're losing me.
I'm Kathy.
No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio.
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
Meaning?
That's a big area to cover.
We're going to work on the message.
"Is".  Did you tell him about the institute?
It doesn't make sense.
That's got to be it.
I suppose you have something in mind?
Is it serious?
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
What are they, please?
No.  I don't.
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
This isn't a game.
Of course.
Alright.  What about me?
And you?
Then show me who you are.
You've got to face the things you feel.
What do you want on it?
Can I come in?
You really haven't seen my best side.
That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
Why not?
I have no intention of getting used to it.
<u>What</u>?
No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
In the old books. It's called a glaive.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
The Fortress moves?
Never.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
Use your sword.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
No! You cannot know that!
I cannot betray my bride.
One night is no betrayal. Have pity on me.  Please, I beg you, do not refuse me. You do not know the price.
Staying alive.
No more, my lord - my friend. With Ergo the Magnificent by your side, your enemies are dead men.
To the place where Death lives.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
At the gallop!
And mine goes with you.
No.
Sugarballs?
I have a cinnamon bar.
You can have half.
A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
Would you desert your friends?
Food for crows.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
Hush!
Look at its insides.
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
It is important to assure the succession.
Yes. We lost five.
How many did you lose?
No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.
Her name is Death.
It's a hundred leagues from here.
That is true.
Yes.
There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
Come on, shit, tell me! Is he beautiful?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
Perfect.
What?
OK.
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
What shall we do?
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
I love you too, and I don't want to lose you.
Yes.
Yeah, what?
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
Huh, that's good!
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
Then...
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
I'll make it.
Thank you.
It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
Twenty miles?  I see.
What?
We can do it together.
Yes.
No I don't.  I don't even know if you'd walk across the street for me.
Where?
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much older than three.  Are your parents home?
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
This is the route approved by triple A.  Even if you followed back roads the entire way, you'd still be looking at roughly the same distance...
Umm, no.  It's just that --
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
Where?
Walking where?
She never ate a slice.
It's mine to risk.
I need your help.
How are you feeling?
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
Thank you. What time is it?
Want to kill yourself? Are you saying that you're drinking as a way to kill yourself?
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
What?
Of course.
Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
Can we just forget it?
Can we just ignore it?
Let's stay for a while.
Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
I don't know. I'll find out though.
With an old friend.
Sera... please go.
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
Sort of.
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
Yes.
Because they got wet.
Who's askin'?
Tell him, Paulette.
About the alibi --
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
I think so...
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
What's the point?  Look at me.
Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law school don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding myself -- Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass just like everyone else. It turns out, I am a joke.
I'm her sister.
Name?
You know her?
I'm still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
Really?
Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica.
So?
I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.
Wow. I'm glad I met you.
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
Oh, my God!!
Really --
I don't know --
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
That's why I think it's time for us to --
Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
Uh -- sure.
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
I gave her my word, Warner.
I'm covered in very expensive Egyptian mud -- hardly naked.
Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
But I'm hideous!
And you... are you not also afraid?
Do you feed on mice and rats?
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
Precisely, my darling.  Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire.
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
Who might these friends be?
We be honored, friend Ogg.
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
How is it this hag knows the truth?
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
It would appear so.
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail.
Certainly understandable.
Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Nay.  This time we strike first!
Why not mine the damned walls?
And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
There isn't much time!
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
Sunlight.
Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
Be patient.
I'll go search for it.
I'm not its master.
Jack!
To fetch your napkin.
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
My own father...
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
Then, perchance you'll me.
Only what's right...
Sunlight?
In the dark... where I join him...
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
Lili... I love you!
Pinching?  Where?
Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
His feet shall never cross my lips.
Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
Not very precise directions.
Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
Jimmy Squarefoot no lost.
To Castle Couer de Noir?
You follow.
What color?
I couldn't sleep last night.
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
Let's shut up and not kill her.
We're not gonna do anything.
Why are you so stupid?
It's freakish.  I don't get it.  I'm not really supposed to touch you, but I can look.
I'm not gay.
Not if what he left me was real.
I don't wanna go.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
He buys and sells the world.
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
Well, it's the least I can do.
Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
We're getting out of the ground today.
He escaped.  He's going back in.
Hey, it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer.
I'll be around to check up on you.
You don't have a choice.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
No you don't.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
No.
The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
Hi, Mom.
He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
I can die trying.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
She's a little sad, is all.
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
When's school over?
One of you would end up dead.
No, you don't.  Trust me.
I don't have a phone.
No.  I was going to let you do that.
The first and the last.
What have you been before today?
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
No, I'm...thanks.  I took something.
I'll find something that won't kill them.
What did I say?
'I'll be in the bedroom.'
You got the money?
I'd be you.
Sooner than the Fall.
You can't go because of Sam?
You can't go with me because of Sam?
Despite you.
I feel in love with George again.
You got a dog?
No.
He'll be gone for his birthday.
Better make it a week.
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
Then what's the problem?
Sharp.
Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.
You know, I'm fixing on retiring at the end of the summer, gonna try to enjoy what few years I have left. What do you think of this place? It's one of those new retirement communities down on the Gulf.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
Here!
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
That's right, a loan officer.
So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
There is no Boom-Boom Room.
When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
Okay then, I'm gonna walk over to that counter and get us some fucking pie.
What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.
Winston. His name's Winston.
If it wasn't for me, you'd be washing up on the beach at Coney Island right now.  "I need all my thumbs and fingers for praying and doing good."
He does it all by himself.
What do you want, Claude?
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
On your behalf. What happened to we?
Does that mean I'm in?
I said you're soft.
Let me take a look at that map.
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
You drew this?!
I'm serious, man. Don't mention it. Ever.
You get ketchup?
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
Crop duster.
I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
That's the way it is.
That was five years ago.
Bullets weren't the problem. That pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.
Goodnight, Ray.
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
Why the hell not?
Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
Why ain't that pick swinging?
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
Move it out.
Movin' it out, boss.
Oh, right. Well, why didn't they get those pardons?
What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
What were they, bootleggers?
Rayford!
Don't worry about that. Hey, fellas, this here is my mama. These are some of my friends. That's Willie, there's Poker Face, Radio, Cookie, Goldmouth, Biscuit, Jangle Leg.
Well, fortunately, I carry my own.
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
He shoots me, I swear I'll take you with me! I just want to hear you say it.
Come on, Spank, I'm just trying to get by here. You remember how it was when you were starting out.
Understood.
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
...their damned souls will be ours.
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
It's not gonna be easy. Your brothers can possess people. So they probably won't look like themselves. You have to be suspicious of everyone.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
How bad?
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
Thanks.
I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
Yes, great movie...
Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
If you want to.
Sometimes, sure.
Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
I love you.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
See something you like, my man?
Your turn.
Anything to eat?
Where do we go?!  Where do we go from here??!!
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
Anybody we know?
Here.
But you put yourself on the circuit!
And now?
Curious.
How a Sandman lives.
Why is it wrong to run?
You're sure you don't want to try?
You know something.
I don't..
If you trusted me, you'd know.
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
Muscle? I don't know that one.
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
And yours.
Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
We can't. We're going back.
Things change!
And Sanctuary?
Yes...
No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.
I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
Stay? They lived together all their years?
No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back.  Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.
Good... You up for a drive?
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
Maid? Relative?
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
If anything else happens, you'll call us.
Yeah... Laurent.
What's that, Ed?
Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
I can't see you tonight.
Sure.
I don't know.
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
Okay...
No.
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
Did you ask him who he is?
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
I did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill. I've never seen this man before. Neither have the guards. I don't think he's in the system.
I... I didn't say anything...
No.
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
That's why I married you.
Maybe.
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
Same one you were reading the other night?
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
Two detectives are coming out.
Now! We're leaving now! I didn't want to come here in the first place.
What job?
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
No... of course not.
I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.
At sixty?
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
What?
You were acting like a different person.
Sure. Sure I do.
You really don't remember?
It was weird...
Sheila...
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
Go home, Sheila.
FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
"Leaving today for London with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria. Conway can tell nothing of his experiences. Is suffering from complete loss of memory. Signed, Gainsford."
I'm a paleontologist.
Oh, I see.
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
Why, of course. Yes.
That's ridiculous.
Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
I'm thinking.
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people—
This doesn't obligate me in any way.
Come on, Lovey.
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
Say, what about that gold deal?
Gold. You were going to—
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
Over by that hill.
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business—
Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
Very often.
Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.
Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"—  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
Then it's done.
Pardon me—
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
Hey!
Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating. Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England. You know what it means.  Here you are. Don't bother about those cables now. I want you to drink with me.  Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway - England's new Foreign Secretary.
Yes.
Dead?
It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned—
She came here in 1888!
All right. I'll prove it to you! You believe everything they've told you - without proof! I'll prove my story!
There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
Where are we going? Huh?
That was easy. I read your books.
Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
Father Perrault. Of course I can't quite get used to this age thing.
Why?
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
They don't?
They don't.  Now, son.  If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  Here's a little piece of advice:    Don't use this so much.
What happens if I say no?
Yes, air? -- OOOMPH.
Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
Don't worry about it.
INS, Washington.  Special services.
Why?  What are you gonna do?
I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
Right.  Oh, and here.
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
Actually, you may have.
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
What the hell does that mean?
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
Come on now.  People are smart.
I dunno. One?
Nothing.
Cause I think we're looking at it.
What if I don't?
I wanna make a deal.
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.
Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
Is it now?
He won't.
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
What --
Found?  Where?
Right.  I know --
We know each other?
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
Lara --
I understand.  Sir.
He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
I go running down there.
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
You gonna tell on me?
Possession alone will cost you six months, not to mention your badge.
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
I guess that's all of it.
Uh, I'll try...
The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
What the fuck is going on?
Tell me!
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
So you won't help me?
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
The safest place of all.
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
You're insane or you think I am.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
Which one is that?
I was, but this whole incident with John made me realize the fragility of what we've built here.  This is John's legacy as much as mine and I want to protect that.
Tell him not now.
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
I don't understand --
This murder is happening at two different times.
What?
Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
Because he thinks he's innocent.
No.  He can't...
Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
So you haven't seen his apartment?
Have you been there recently?
You mean after he lost your son.
What was it then?
To what?  Trap him?
I haven't seen him in two years.
Jesus...
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
Yeah.
Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
No thank you.
You sure? I just made it.
We have snifters
Yes, sir.
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
What if I gave you forty?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
He's alright.
But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
No.
Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
How could you let her see this?
I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
Get your hands off of her.
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
So, when's the drop.
How so?
Yeah.
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
Traveling light. I like that.
You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
I know the number.
You wanna go right now?
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
Why not? I grew up in bars. It's fun for a kid.
She really liked the kitchen.
I'll get the girl.
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
How'd they know who you were?
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
Fuck this.
You fucking nuts?
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
Where?
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
Wanna bet?
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
No more, man.
You're not getting a gun.
No. I'll wait here.
And you grew up in Manhattan?
You see a Ricky Slade?
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
Nah, man...
Soho Grand, right?
No. What is it?
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
Far as she knows you're John Gotti. Now put the shit down and act like you got some ass.
Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
Outfit? What's he talking about?
A rose by any other name would --
Red, and I ain't no punk.
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
Heard where?
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
I don't want your money.
Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
I thought you was smart. But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like a monkey. And the white man sees you and he laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't white.
Okay, okay.
But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
What for?
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
A black man playing big league ball is something.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
Come, sit with us.
She ate.
There's nothing to talk about.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
Shhh!
I assumed...
I don't think we know for certain.
Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
Say what you're saying.
I ain't stupid.
I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need my rest.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
The hell you are.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
Might be all right.
Might be, shit. Man, I know this town. I got my own fences. Who the hell are you? Who put you in charge?
That's right.
Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man bleed like that.
Yes sir.
All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood.
Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission.  Really. You won't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico.
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
[I have a friend there.]
So where do we begin?
He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
[We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
I drink.
What do you mean, I'm here?
This is Mexico, they do everything backwards.
Nothing wrong.
Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
Why not?
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
No.
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
How do you think he got out?
Yes. Actually, he was driving me crazy.
They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
You feel sorry for the husband?
Yes.
I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
She understands men.
[The car will not be powerful and have no trunk.]
[No. Why?]
[We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple.
All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
What for?
Where you going?
Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
Who?
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
What they say?
Catherine, my sister...
Who?
Your son Marty?
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
I really should get home...
What're you talking about? You're a real likeable person. You'll make friends out there in Portchester one, two, three. You'll have people visiting you alla time. I'll come visit you. I'll borrow my brother Freddie's car, or you can call me up when you feel blue, or I'll call you up. And it's gonna be nice. Don't be so afraid.
No, I'm not kidding.
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I think I'll just hang arounna house and watch...
Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
Waddaya talking about?!!
Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
That's right.
What the hell's going on here?
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
What's that?
Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
We could steal one of the choppers.
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
I have a tent to myself.
Anyway, we want to get this letter off.
But what about Major Houlihan?
I think I heard about that.
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
Oh, Jesus.
Not necessarily.
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.
We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
But I'm married.
Something else we have in common.
Very happily married.
Of course not.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
I didn't have much choice.
Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.
The one and only.
I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
What's wrong with him?
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
No, one thing I finally know for sure, I'll never function with a woman again.
Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
Now I'll have to wait at least a week. If I announced it tomorrow, after what our new Chief Nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from Seoul to Washington.
You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.
I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
Yes, sir?
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
In that case, here are ten basic plays. I think that's about all this bunch can handle.
I used to throw the javelin.
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
Boys, we're home free.
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paper—and forty heads are chopped off!
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Hello.
John Doe Clubs? What for?
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
Yes. The John Doe Party.
Oh.
If you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away.
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
What John Doe?
Sure!  When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job!  A wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world.
Oh!
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
Where's Connell?
Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.
Where'd you play?
Sure. Hey, but the biggest thing I didn't tell you . . .
Shut up!
Yes, both of 'em! But don't let him out of your sight.
Who are they?
Yeah. That's—that's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says.
A what?
The elevators are still runnin'.
Hiyah, John.  John, I want to have a little talk with you.  What's the matter—are you falling? Come here.
And you'd feel like an awful sucker if you found yourself marching right in the middle of it, wouldn't you?
Well?
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
Were you paid for it—or weren't you?
No, I didn't write it, but—
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started—
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
Yeah. I, uh, well . . . No. It'll wait.  Say, he's a nice man, isn't he? Mr. Norton, I mean. He's, er, he's done an awful lot for the—
Good night, John.
Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, you know I love Ann and it's gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because, well, you know, she's so wonderful, and, well, the best I ever was was a bush-league pitcher.
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his glove—flopped into a chair—and has taken out his ocarina.
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
Well, don't stand there, you idiot. Go and look. Open the window. Oh, why did he have to pick on my building?
No, sir.
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
Deal.
Yeah, okay.
Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
They want Walter dead!
Then where's my FUCKING car!
Wait a minute, lemme see that.
What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
How did you like Toronto?
You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
We could fill it with water.
You have to. It's a tradition.
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
You're a compulsive gambler?
I have two words for you... Seek help.
Fine.
To run last?
COME ON, RUSSELL!
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
And what if you can't live with it?
That's a chance I gotta take.
Only that floor.
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.
I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about.
You thought I was talking about getting married?!
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed.
I'll provide you with transportation.
Yes, I believe he has --
Why --
If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
Yes.
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
New York.
Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
The truth.
It's not used for anything.
Not his style.
Then how do you know about --
But you were with me.
Because you'll never believe me.
There?
Just like that --
Access established.
Uplink selected.
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
Ah... sure.
Yeah, right.
I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.
Ryan's Comet!!
WE'RE OUTTA HERE!
A stellar idea, Skull.
You want me to place a few calls?
You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--
What do you mean "basically"?
Feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric HORNITOR!  KEEP DIGGING.  THE DREADFUL SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY.  ONCE I HAVE MY ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES UP AND RUNNING, I SHALL ANNIHILATE ANGEL GROVE... AND THEN... THE WORLD
We couldn't have done it better ourselves.
Strength in numbers!!
Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
Maybe that's why I'm the Boss.
I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
Don't worry. I got friends to take care of that.
Can't we get a couple whores over?
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
How's Bugsy doin'?
Tommy Reina's hauntin' his dreams. But he'll do his job.
I can just imagine.
I'm already late.
You got something to hide?
Why? You're the innocent one.
So you all make the same mistakes?
It'll all be over tomorrow. No more wars. No more killin'. Just livin' normal like everybody else.  You'll be stuck with me for good.
I'll do fine.
I NEED THE TWENTY!
Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
Ya piss like a man.
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
What the fuck does that mean?
You gotta plan these things.
And I got it all planned.
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
Not if they all die at once.
Not stupid. Fat.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
I must know more of you, my son.
You get fifteen percent.
Share with them as you wish. Do business with them on your own. But no filthy Jew will ever be a brother to me.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
Masseria's been after me too.
Come on. Be polite.
This is nice. I mean it.
What?
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Bend over?
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
How much?
Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
<u>I'll</u> worry about the guards. <i></i> OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.
Well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. It was different then. I was <u>depressed</u>. My life is great now. I'm in love!
I don't <u>know</u>.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
What?
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
You know ...  ... whoops!
I don't want to talk about it.
My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.
Yeah.
I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?
This way?
Yeah.  Not far.  You will be fine.  It's still day.
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
Thanks very much, sonny--
It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
But it *isn't*?
What for? Why, suppose there's a storm--all lines are down--how you gonna get a message to Ma?
I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine-- call Saunders--
Blow a bugle!
Well, why don't they try the police-- get some blood hounds--or Indian guides--
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
What's this, Diz?
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
You got worms.
Good idea. When?
What?
Take me home, Diz.
I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!
Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
That settles it! I will not be attacked and belittled by my own children in my own home! My nerves are strained to the breaking point!
No wonder--without your dinner.
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
*Your* political future! I bought it for you and made you a present. And I can grab it back so fast it'll make your head spin. You got a nerve to stand there and worry about just *your future* when we're in this spot!  The man is--*Miller*.
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
Oh, a *boy*!
Than what?
Emma!
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
I beg your pardon?
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
Good as new! It's quite all right--
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
Gosh! You see sir--I was fixing some plaster for a cast on Amos' leg-- he's always chewing 'em off. I'll only be a minute--if you'll excuse me, sir--
Certainly would, Joseph.
How's Amos, Ma?
Office of--Senator Smith?
Pleased to meet you, sir.
Well--he's got nothing on me.
Convene?
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
Right.
Committee, huh?
What?
The Steering Committee.
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
And something else, too, Miss Saunders-- the spirit of it--the idea--the--
He did?
I've been over every foot of it. You couldn't have any idea. You'd have to see for yourself--  --the prairies--the wind leaning on the tall grass--
I've got more. You better tell me.
You couldn't. You've never been out there, you said.
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
Wow!
You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
Oh--you are!
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
No! No! Gosh. See, there you are! I'm not making sense!
Yes, sir--
Great!  The Government's putting dough in too many places *now*!
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
Fine thing Jim Taylor wished on me-- show him the monuments--I need this job like I need ten pounds.
That's dynamite, Joe!
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
No?
No?
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
Joe--what's the matter with you-- where you're concerned, I wouldn't take the slightest risk--'specially now after the great reputation you've made in the Senate. Why, look at this campaign I've started for you in all my papers. You're the logical man from the West on the National ticket--at the convention, anything can happen--
Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
And Honest Abe's ideals. A rare man-- these days.
Senator Paine.
Certainly.
He sure is.
Were you present when all these things took place?
But they did take place?
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
Oh, I don't mind.
Now, what do you see?
I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
What's that?
What did you mean by that?
Gosh! What do you know about that!
The drums. He taught me to play some.
No, I don't mind.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
Mary - I - excuse me—
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
Don't be ridiculous.
Huh?
Can I have a month's vacation?
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he—
Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
Boy, was he burning.
Close that door.  Will you get Mrs. Cedar on the phone, please?
Will you stop worrying! It was I who got old man Semple to turn everything over to us, wasn't it? And who got the Power of Attorney from him ! All right, and I'll get it again!  I'll take it easy. Those books'll never leave this office.
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
Me, sir?
Yes, sir.
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
What?
All set.
Yeah?
Okay.
What for?
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
Yes, of course, if you wish. But you must be prepared. This sort of thing will be daily routine.  If it becomes annoying, you let me know. Goodbye, Mr. Deeds. Goodbye, sir.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
Oh, that's different if it's just poetry.
No, thanks.
Oh, they insisted on following me.
Mary Dawson, huh? Mary Dawson, my eye. That dame took you for a sleigh ride that New York will laugh about for years. She's the slickest, two- timing, double-crossing—
They can have the Estate.
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Oh, Mr. Deeds—
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
No, I mean - about my client.
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil.  I was watching you.
I don't know.
Don't pay any attention to her.
Now you keep out of this!
Yes, sir. It makes the head feel smaller.
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
You try it.
Could you come with me please?
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
No, not really.
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
No?
Go to hell.
What?!
There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
Nope.
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
We've been talking about her, mostly.
What do you think's wrong with her?
I do.
What?
Maybe you can empathize with this -- Maximum fine. Three months in jail, three months house arrest. Sentence to begin immediately at the Orchard Valley Correctional Facility. Case closed. This court is adjourned.
Where am I supposed to eat?
Lily.
Don't need it.
That would explain it.
I'm trying.
We're going for a walk.
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
I don't know. I barely made it today.
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
Something's bothering her.
What?
You've got a funny idea of funny.
Really? What would it take?
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
Thanks to this therapy, I now know what I'm looking for. I need to find a man like you.  Not one who's treating me, of course.  And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've given me the confidence.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
I don't follow you.
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
Yes, and that is what I have got right now. I have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. I have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... So that now I am under the delusion...  ...that I am in love with you.
Hello.
Which show was that?
I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.
Of course... I haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast.
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
Just chill for a second. Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous.
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
What are you talking about?
He said -- "Which we already knew!"
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
Okay... let's say that, for now.
No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
Oh, it's okay. It's just not something to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, I'd give it, say... a two.
Just you.
Sounds like you have several.
It wasn't the best situation.
That'd be Lily.
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
I'm honored.
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
Lots of institutions. My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall. Had a little spot next to the yogurt place.
Priests. Imhotep's priests.
Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
What friend? You're my only friend.
What does he want the book for?
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
Water turning to blood.
I am an English woman.
Three hundred pounds!
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
If you call that a kiss.
Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here?
And what is that?
Alright then, Me, I,... I read the book, I woke him up and I intend to stop him.
The creature!? Are you sure!?
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
I think you were jealous
That just makes you more gullible.
Picked his pocket, actually.
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
Still...
Shut-up and get me off of here!
Be nice. That thing saved my life.
OWCH! That's really got to hurt.
Yes, I know, I do that to people.
And then he'll be coming after Evy.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
Really?
One last tweak.
I'll be down in a jiffy.
Do I?
And some sandwiches --
But they all had one thing we haven't got.
It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.
Oh that's right -- they squished him... Heck of a guy.
Think positive.
Ummm.
Have you considered my offer?
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Really?
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Why not?
Then why are you here?
Date?
It is?
I wouldn't mind being famous.
You don't seem very angry right now.
Monica, where are you?
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
And you are a fool.
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
And a skunk stinks!
My heart died a long time ago.
Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now!  The great ones RIDE ALONE!  Adios, muchachos! 
Now you're talking.
SO WHAT?
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
With what?
Or flowers.
Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
No.
So what can I get you?
I always knew that you were special.
Be a Mohican. 
Yeah, but how do we get to them?
Through there!
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
I shall tell you in the strictest confidence -- when I was a boy, I had a passion for rafts, and never had the opportunity to build one.
I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
Yes, sire?
Yes, sir.
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
Thank you, sir.
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
The first reports came in at about ten.
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare.  You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear.  You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom.
Lisette.
Not even the slightest hint of something?
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
She must have been in love with you.
You are my old friend.
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
Will you be joining us, soon?
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
Five minutes.
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
It's me.
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
I wrote it.
What?
Yes, I wrote it.
You couldn't face telling me what?
Yes.
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
Can you give me a drink, please?
If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
Yes, sir.
A message from Citizen Fouche.
With his army of 400,000 men in concealed bivouacs, on a ten mile front, in the forests, bordering the banks of the Vistula river, Napoleon conducted a last minute personal reconnaissance, disguised in the uniform of a Polish lancer.
Thanks, Unc.
Cash money.  They wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan.  That's for suckas.  They got my daddy like that for a Cadillac years ago.  I got the only house on the block that's paid for. That's why I'm the king around here.
Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
Y'all never use it?
'Cause your lips is getting black.
You know what he mean, dude.
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
Oh, yeah, where you work at?
I know, be still.
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
You don't know Baby D.
Yeah, ya'll got a notice today.  It came certified mail.
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
Nothing.
What's the B-G's?
My brothers won't give me a ride.
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Okay.
Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
Have you seen Day-Day?
Nice to meet you?
Well, you gonna have to go postal then.
Sorry, dude.
Where's Craig?
This is a knock.
I don't know.
Bite his ear!
What?!
I know.  I'm sorry.
I'll take you later.
Nothing.  What you want?
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
San Diego.
What?
I appreciate that.
Ah.
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
I would also like to apologize.
Don't worry. She's good with kids.
Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.
How should I...?
Let me talk to her again.
No.
I want'to talk to her.
Forget about it.
Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
No way.
It's a twenty.
Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
Then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. I don't want him twisting my arm off.
Kill the Governor.
Who?
You're going to go see her.
This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
I think this is worth a dollar.
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all.
You're a big girl, huh?
I'm not a big girl but I'm not a baby.
Help me get her off the rug.
Where?
I kill her anyway.
No, Ben.
You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
No.
You have all sinned!
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
How do you mean?
Mother, I only --
She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
Satan.
Ah.
Amen.
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
The devil wins sometimes!
Sshhh...
When Mr. Powell's our Daddy then I can tell him about --
Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
Yes, I reckon that's it.
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
Dead.
Up river.
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
Why sure, boy, sure.
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
No, Harry! I thought --
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
You'll whip me!
Pearl and John.
Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
Get the kit!
You believe in the Boogey Man?
Well what you reading it for?
My dream.
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
Okay. Hi, dad.
What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
He's dangerous.
I won't.
To bed with you, c'mon.
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
Okay.
I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
Of course. What's that?
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Naturally, Comrade.
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
You should. I'll show you.
I see.
Evening gown?
Positively not!
I can tell you exactly.
Yes, Comrade?
Don't worry... there will be enough.
In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand...
Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
Good morning, Gaston.
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
Yes.
Thank you, Louis.
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
I'll send you a muff.
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
That's two weeks from Thursday...
Au revoir.
I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. 
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
Suspicions... nothing but suspicions!... That's the trouble with you! If you don't let me in I'll stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from Russia!... I'll picket your whole country....
Yes. Could you give me some information?
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
In other words you don't know.
And where are we?
Yes, very strange.
Yes.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
Is that customary?
I will start with you.
I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
You repeat yourself.
The bayonet? Did you really?
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Let's forget that we ever met.
I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
I don't like your following me.
I always eat here.
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
No.
Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, "Just a moment, you charming little dress, I want you to meet Ninotchka... you two were meant for each other." Ninotchka feels more comfortable.
Ninotchka, I love you.
Ninotchka, you're jealous.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
Comrades! Good people of France!
No speech?
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed you I betrayed the Russian ideal. Leon, I should be stood up against the wall.
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
...but big.
Who cried that one?
Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, "Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!"
They belong to the people.
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
Yes.
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
What is this, Swana?
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
I told you to go, madame.
You leave me no choice.
I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. I'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport. That's my proposition, Comrade Yakushova.
What do you want?
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
This will do. 
The future of the common people.
That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch à la Père Mathieu. 
Where is it?
My jewels?!
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
You don't need to check the tape.  I know what I said.
Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
No, we have nothing to hide.
'Cause he hates you.  It's worse when you get it from someone you trust.
No!  Magruder!  That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point.
And?
Pay him.
Sir, there's dead American kids here. Let's say we don't apologize for Kent State, but maybe we could have a national prayer day ...
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
No, no.  He's our only "star" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to.
There's no secrets here, Al.
That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
Money.  Follow the money.
She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
Let him finish, Bob.
Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
What about the documents he promised?
He'll give us the documents.  But I think he should be offered the ambassadorship to Iran.  Then he'll go without a whimper.
Thou must.
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
Thou must find thy peace at the center, Richard.  Strength in this life.  Happiness in the next.
What ... ?
Yes ...
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
Mr. Castro.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
I know you've been very careful not to.  That's why I'm concerned.
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
They're around.
Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times.
I beg your pardon --
It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
How a fat man gets so many girls.
I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.
You're the one who should be in politics, John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack.
That'll be the day.
Mr. Nixon.
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
Proud?
Buddy, before you join the jubilation at my being beaten again, you should remember: People vote not out of love, but fear.  They don't teach that at Sunday School or at the Whittier Community Playhouse!
I'll concede in the morning.
That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
I asked him, "Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?"  And he said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy!  Bomb them where they live." ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV?
Are you okay?
Yes, it's been a long time ...
No.
Won or lost?
The "crises"?
Well, that's wonderful.  So get me this "crisis" thing, Dick; I'll be glad to take a look at it.
How fresh is this coffee?
In Angola. Yeah.
How come're you doin that?
I don't know. I feel overmatched.
I'm... discouraged.
You can't stop what's comin. Ain't all waitin' on you.
Try "old" on for size.
That don't hardly say it. He shoots the desk clerk one day, and walks right back in the next and shoots a retired army colonel.
Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
Not word one.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
Gun out and up.
I don't know. Oh.
No sir.
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
Lord no. I'm not retired.
You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again.
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Did you go up to his trailer?
No me mate.
Well -- where ya goin'?
All right.
So what're you goin' up there for.
That's foolish. You pick the one right tool.
With anything?
Now. We close now.
You live in that house behind the store?
For what?
Everything.
You stand to win everything. Call it.
Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.
When did you last see him.
Okay.
How well do you know Chigurh.
I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
Not any way.
So what does that make me? Your buddy?
No I don't have it.
No. You don't.
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
Are you jackin' with me?
What outfit.
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
Junior year!
A woman can write a check.
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
Well, do something, then, damnit!
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
That's a nice name for what you need...
Come on, I have to get this dressing off... it itches! And what about my fish? Who is taking care of them?
Any idea where it is?
I know plenty.
You gotta go, we're pinned down!
They're fine... you miss it?
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... "If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be friends." Now that's beautiful.
This is really awkward...
I'd rather not...
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
Yes, ma'am.
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
Do what?
Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
Yes... maybe it was.
...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
I ran back in to get the phone.
Or the vitamins? Or the...?
I came for love...
Uh-huh.
He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
Really?
I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer.
LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!
I came for love. My fiancé is here.
Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?
No, this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there, which I'm trusting you with, 'cause if it gets out, I'm on the street...
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
Who?
Fine.
He is real.
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
Your husband?!
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
No, that should be more than --
Really. And where was that, old man?
We don't know which Buick, do we?
I didn't. You gave me a look!
...that's a good motto.
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
What doesn't?
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
I said 'got it?'
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
Betty was a lovely child.
I see.  May I?
He's waiting...
Are you sure you want to encourage this?  No, you're right, let's have some fun. So, what did happened next, "Betty"?
No! Let me try this!
Oh, there's no tellin' what that girl could've accomplished, and she never had it easy. Never really had a childhood... caring for her father, going to school.
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
No... before that.
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
You can't do this - we just been pardoned!  By the Governer himself!
You mis'able little sneak thief...
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.
Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Oh no, no, just the reg'la side -
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
It's just a symbol, honey -
No weddin'.
And you were right about that ring. Any other weddin' band would not do. But this-here was foreordained, honey; fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya have to have confidence -
You -
Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
The hell you say! Wash is kin!
It was in his bureau.
They cut a record in here, few days ago, old-timey harmony thing with a guitar Accump-accump-uh-
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
I never said any of that!
What did you call her? What did I hear you call her, you son of a bitch?
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
I'm doing okay, sir.
Not a fucking chance, asshole!
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
How're you doing, Sarge?
What did you call me, boy?
Before that.
Yes I do!
Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
One more minute.
Great.
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
No! That's not true!
Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Do you go to school?
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
He didn't give you much choice.
I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough.
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
Jesus, that Lynette! I rode her hard and put her up wet.
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
Do you know that for sure?
Peace out.
There is not one thing funny here.
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
I can't.
We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
Where did you get this clown?
The fuck did you bring a gun for?
Pure idiot.
They're coughing.
Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
What about us?
Adios.
Huh?
What do you want?
Could you slow down a little?  Or we could wait for the car...
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
Ever read any Poe?
No, Edgar Allen.
The furniture guy?
Got us in here, didn't I?
0150.
It doesn't work?!
Wait.
Nope.
Chills?
Give me a break.
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
Uh uh.
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
I'm sorry, Mom.
But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!
No! This is my private property. According to California law we have a constitutional right to bear arms.
Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
Yeah... whatever you say.
Fuck how they operate. Just do it. like your man says, "By any means necessary."
Yeah, it's me.
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
Look this is bull...
Naw... I gotta...
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
We're working on that...
The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby...
Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to?
Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired...
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
Whatever you need, I'll be there.
Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
Maybe...
If you got something to say, say it.
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
Later for that. I'm done either way...
No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
Yeah... cop hit me...
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
It's a start.
You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.
He's my father.
You couldn't have known.
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
And if I triumph, you triumph.
Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
He tried.  It didn't take.
Flanking riders?
We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some.
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it...
It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
She is.  Don't go in there.
You know what happened.
No, I don't.
I know he did and he's sorry.  He'll come back as soon as he can.
That's a damn long time...
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
And your principles?
We saw.
Long time.
Robert.  Robert E. Lee.
Earned.
That bad?
But father, they might come this way.
Quiet.
You'll see soon enough, hon.
Yaay!
For a little while.
Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
Because you promised.
Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
Oh, faith's a little more than just believing.
Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
Ayuh.
Because it's right.
No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
Wendigo?
Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
Louis--
Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die.
Good d--
That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda.
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
Aye, aye, sir!
Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail -- you and Cotton.  I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and- span and ship-shape!
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
No you won't.
That's right.
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
I'll watch my back.
The situation has changed.
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
Thank you, sir.
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
Then I can wear men's clothing.
Yes, father.
Yes -- yes.
Or, rather, Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman, don't you think?  He fancies you, you know.
About the day we met. Do you remember?
It would appear, so do you.
He said you say that!  He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew, and you'll be naked.
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
Aye, that'll about do it.
She can hold a bit longer.
We're catching up!
What?  He never told me that.
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
I said, no lies.
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
Ah, but you have heard of me.
Ah.  Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record.  So if you'll excuse me ...
You need to find yourself a girl.  Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
Where does it make berth?
We need to go!
I'd die for her.
'Bootstrap?'
You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
Don't worry.  I've already got a Quartermaster -- there!
On what?
The worst.  On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
You've seen it?
No.  She hasn't.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
You don't have to give it to us because Dr. Nebbleman can just cut it out of him.
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.
Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something.
Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
No.  I'm getting used to it.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
Okay, arms up, lean forward.
Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
A man?
What did he want?
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
No!  Well, not those exact words.
What?  No kiss?  Not even for old times sake?
I guess I should be flattered.
That's what I thought.
We'll see?  What does that mean?
You think the chemists that invented Agent Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'Boy, I really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.'  You think Oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
What has happened to you is nothing compared to what is going to happen to Calumet City if we don't hurry.
That's right.
You're the doctor.
This is what I deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists?
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
Yeah.  Old times.
What did you want my hair for?
You mean he's polymerized, like me?
Oh yes you are!
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
Yeah, and what might that be?
We lost him.
Exactly.
Goodbye, Stew—
You're all right.
You may go, Smythe.
Sure, I'll take a chance.
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
Stop trying to be funny, and get ready, will you?
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
I see.
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
All right, I'm a child. Have it any way you want. But I'm going back to my own apartment, where I should have lived in the first place. But no, I got to listen to you and move here. All right. If you want to live with me, Anne, okay. But the sign outside will say "Mr. Stew Smith" and you'll have to be "Mrs. Stew Smith" or there's nothing doing. No more Anne Schuyler's husband—He has his bag all packed by this time. He snaps it shut viciously, lifts it off the chair, picks up his hat, and notices Mrs. Schuyler staring open-mouthed at him.  —and here's some more news for you. You can take your red room, your green room, your left wing and your right wing, and you know what you can do with them!  Come on, Gallagher.
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
Mother!
Well, I got a seat, but I have no place to put it.
You're the Tribune man?
Yale '21, I believe.
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
Yeah - go on.
There's no catch. This is on the up and up. Of course all you have to do is just sign the article - by Anne Schuyler's Husband.
Yeah, little Gloria.
I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
Not on my own beat, no.
Yes, sir.
Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
Araby?
Araby, my eye—!
'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage, a beautiful sight to see—'  Tweet, tweet - ha, ha—
Now Mr. Smith, now please—
Outside!
Yes sir!
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
I hope you'll be very happy.
It's the smoke.
My error.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
How is her family going to feel about it?
Staring at us?
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
To Old Madrid.
Did Conrad draw on his imagination?
What do you know about Conrad?
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
Yeah?
Sorry, boss—
Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
Surely, come right in.
Unconscious. You know, when you don't know anything. Your natural state. There are some people - you can't buy their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well, I happen to be one of those guys.
"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"
They've been ready for the last half hour.
I have. Double-strength!
It's haunted just the same.
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
It doesn't matter.
In my handbag.
I won't.
Bud brought it to me.
She's crying.
I don't know.
All night?
Really Biff? The keenest?
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
No. What?
Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
Yes I did.
What?
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
What are you doing?
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
Pleasantville Marathon?
No way.
I don't know ... It's not possible ...  Is it possible?
All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores or something.
We're supposed to be in school.
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
What do you mean?
Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
That's great.
Yeah ...
Wow.
What?
Right here.
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
No. I baked them for you.
You don't know?
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
I'm not sure.
No I won't. I swear.
Scout?
COME BACK!!!
... Hi.
Excuse me?
Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
I didn't do anything wrong.
No you're not.
Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
... Yeah.
Well here I am.
What happened?
Hey.
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
That's it.
No.
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
You're being weird again, see. Come on. Please don't be weird.
Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
Nothing.
I'm in my bedroom.
...yeah....well you have me now.
I'm fine. Who is this?
This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
I know I did. But I don't.
Why did you tell me you did, then?
This is not cool.
No.
I don't know.
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
It's terrible, no.
It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
Sure.
...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
Yeah.
You were talking about the promotion --
So that was your pudding?
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
Ok.
It's Barry.
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
That's right you travel so much.
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
For what?
Ok.
Just have you for one second, please.
Did you do it?
Why? ...what?
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
And your name?
What's that for?
-- and this is confidential?
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
You came all the way from Los Angeles to tell me that?
We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
I didn't know you had a sister?
Yeah.
Can you hang on a second?
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
WHICH?
I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?
....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....
Hi.
What?
How much money do you have in your pockets?
Yes.
This is a bunch of bullshit.
Ok.
You can't just stay in your house.
When can you leave?
Are you coming to eat with us?
No.
Ok.
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
They incite us to act. In ways we should not... cannot... a lesson the Marquis would do well to learn.
I must grant him his last rites.
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
I'll fill page after page, I promise.
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
You know what sacrilege is, don't you? The last refuge of the failed provocateur.
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
-- that was lust --
Was it impotence?
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
His wife's influence.
A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture.
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
You'd suffer in her stead?
HER NAME, ABBE.
How is the patient faring?
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
Yes?
Was ever a man more risquè? He wants to take me every way!
I'll fill every slippery hollow; if you're obliging, then you'll swallow!
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
Yes?
"Well worth the dig!"
Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it through my tiny hole...
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
Is it terribly erotic?
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
Oh, but I am!
Of course.
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
You've come to lecture me?
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
You're just scared.
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
Mm.
And director.
To make pictures.
So I've been told.
Do you?
Nuts. She only cares about the money. She thinks I'll make you cut her out of the w-w-w-w...  will.
Pops
I will not defend my life to you--
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
Sir? 
Sir?
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
Good. Retain that feeling. Let it nourish you from this day forth. It shall nourish us both
We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some of us humans need sleep!
love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "
Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
Telling stories.
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
Yeah, it's the place God would have built, if he'd had the money.
Orson, please ... it's too bright
Please don't say this.
Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
This ain't George's doing--!
Yeah, ain't it swell?
Herman.
To do what?
You're lying to me.
Get out
Please don't ask me to do this.
It's the safe bet, Orson. There's nothing wrong with that.
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
For Christ's sake, shut up--
The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.
I don't want to sit
Without me. I'm afraid. I got the axe this morning.
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
You want to do the life of Jesus?
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
Ok, champ.
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
What?
And where you goin'?
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
You know?
You heard me, I said hit me.
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
Yeah --
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now.
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
You want the title shot?
Say what you're gonna say.
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
I did keep an eye...
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
But you said "you."
Whadda ya mean?
Did you ever fuck my wife?
Three more, I figure.
You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Can you see it?
What does that mean?
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
Jake...
Do what I say.
I was just...
Who asked you?
You're not interested in him?
You asleep?
Nobody. I love you, remember?
I never noticed his face.
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
I am answering...
Yeah --
What?
Why don't you just call him?
I'm leaving you Jake.
No. Open the door.
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
Can't you get the money from your friends?
He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
Get lost.  Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat."
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
Jefferies?
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
Do that.
Jeff -- huh?
I can't do that.
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
That depends on who "they" were.
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
Why should I?
Tell her to bring it back!
People have different emotional levels that --
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
But it takes a particularly low type of man to do it.
Huh?
There's something buried there.
To bail Lisa out of jail.
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
You haven't even heard from him?
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
I mean what I said.
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
What is it you're looking for?
You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact, but ample enough.
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
A new disease.
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
They always live.
Yeah.
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
No.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
You don't want me to go.
And you can depend on me, son. Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear.
Listen--can't you wait till we get home?
Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything?
He's home.  I heard the car.
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
Why don't you come back tomorrow, son?  Ever been booked before?
You remember me?
You scared?
Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go!
What's a chickie-run?
Who has?
I'm here.  Shut up.
No.  I'm scared.
I'm what?  What?
Hey!  How 'bout that!
Plato!
No.  At dawn.
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
Here.
But you didn't hurt anybody.
That's a fine way to behave!
Good Lord!
Do I have to spell it out?
Leave me alone.
She eats him alive and he takes it.
Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble.
Bully for you.
Where what was.
You going there?
Neither can I.
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
No.
Why?
Awful?  No.  It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time.
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
What a relief!
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
It is for me too.
Hi.
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
What, he should see me help you catch him?
Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
We sell children's toys --
I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?
Radio said negative five.
Radio said.
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
One more. Smile. One more.
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
Yes it was all you --
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
Nick, no --
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
JESUS CHRIST!
You're not hearing me here --
You're in on this.
But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
They're truck drivers.
All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.
We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
No, you can't --
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
You what...
I shared his cell!
But you were saying you were...
What's her middle name?
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
Five million?
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
Christmas... Eve...
We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man.
More than you know.
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
No, Gabriel... no...
I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
No.
There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.
Ash?
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
That right? Shit. I used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. Shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. You ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?
No, the place. The remodeling. moving everything around.
Merlin, I didn't know --
Oh, man --
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
I'm just saying.
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
GUARD!!!
YOU TELL HER!
NICK!!!
How'd you know I'd do it.
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
What?
What? Nobody set anybody up.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
There is no fuckin' set up!  Look, this is the news. Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two. White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you.
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
What?
But what is this?
You can do some crazy things with it.
When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass. They're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever. If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Drops 'em right to the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose. Freaks everybody out. Nobody says fuckin' shit after that. You might get some bitch talk shit to ya. But give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face next. Watch her shut the fuck up. Now if it's a manager, that's a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around. So if one's givin' you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy. So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a-bitch in two. If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers. The little one. Then you tell 'im his thumb's next. After that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear. I'm hungry, let's get a taco.
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
No, they're not.
Mr. Pink.
He don't tip.
You do?
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you.
All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
Correct.
Joe.
I don't believe in it.
Dead.
You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
Let's go in the other room...
As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
I got the diamonds.
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
He scared the fuckin' shit outta me. I thought he was dead fer sure.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
Maybe he did.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
No. We came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  Can you fix it for us?
Just about.
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
Yeah.
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
The who?
But the rest is right.
Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.
Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
What does a man usually tell a girl?
Then let's get started. The sooner I get to Sonora, the better I'll like it.
I'm sorry.
I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
A man I used to know.
Like what?
Nice.
Yes.
At the ranch maybe?
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
All right. I'll tell you.
He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
Lednov.
Can I have my gun back?
I won't again.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
Maybe I haven't lived as long as you have, but I know a sight more about people and I wouldn't talk to a mule like you talked to her and, if I did, I'd say how sorry I was. I'd be man enough to do that.
Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
Kind of sore.
The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.
All right, you didn't know.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
Well cheer, why don't you? No more responsibilities, Mary. Marcia -- Elaine -- me -- all taken care of. Down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry about.
There aren't any women here.
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
What's the use.
I don't know -- I don't know.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
Okay. A-B-C -- D-E-F -- G-H-I --
And you've got me all figured out?
It's a long ways yet.  I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.
Okay... maybe that would be best.
No, you don't understand. It's here in these statues...
What?! What is it, a monster?!
Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
No. Keep rubbing.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
Only that if this cat did attack, he's less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. Come on, it's college. Time for you two to experiment.
Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
Any of them hot?
What's this?
Right. What about condoms?
Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
That's why we came here, remember?
Alright. Come on, you guys.
Thanks, handyman.
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
Soon. First, I must bless this house.
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
What happened?
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 
That's right up the street! Come on! Just in case!
He's really cute!
Jeeezzz!
You said you hated him.
It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!
Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
Misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.
MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!
Don't wake the kids...
Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
Who is this?
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
Are those pussy-willows?
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
Marvin A. Pickles.
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
It's the least I could do.  I heard shouting.
Right here!
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
You forgot something...
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Nice one, huh? Winter's coming.  Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it...
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
I'd like to get out of here.
About forty-five dollars.
For the time being, I imagine that must do.
Redi's all right.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
And that was all?
I'm not a youngster. I can understand.
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
I saw him on the floor. He was cut -—  --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him —— white —— and the men holding him up between them.
I won't do it again. We're friends. I'll never order you about again.
The people at the restaurant?
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
Not from me.
That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.
It's not a searchlight —— it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince —- not stars --
What's wrong, Mary?
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet ——	one as a detective.
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
Why not let your publisher judge that?
Tell me where Jacqueline is -— we've got to find her.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
Perhaps
If I didn't know where she was, could I take you to her? Get your hat and coat. We haven't much time.
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice —— that's it, isn't it?
Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
You're very flippant and perhaps wise, but not wise enough to see the truth, Louis.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
Thank you, my dear.
I had to help get rid of the body. You saw it on the subway. And I warn you, Mary -- go back -- you don't know what you're doing, or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister. You go back to school - - go back and forget Jacqueline.
But she was here?
I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
False alarm.
Well...
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
Well... well, the cliché about the security of it, that's really true. We own a house, and I really like that, you know? And I like that John was just made junior partner, so he has a steady job and he's not some...
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
I feel like they do.
Okay. I think... I think sex is overrated. I think people place way too much importance on it. And I think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap. I m not saying women don't want it, I just don't think they want it for the reason men think they do.  I'm getting confused.
You had sex with you therapist?
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
Videotapes.
I can see that. What are they?
Why not?
Yes.
I know.
It's not my place to tell you these things, Ann. You have to find out by yourself or from John directly. You have to trust me on this.
It won't. Are you ready?
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
No, you're not.
Not entirely.
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
I don't know.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
Why not?
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
Yes!
Yeah, I know.
Did you do anything?
God, no.
What visitor?
Is he still at your house?
I guess, but not because of the way he looked or anything. He's just so different, somebody new to have a conversation with. I'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon, you know? It's just boring. I don't know, he was just different. And he's really on about truth a lot, being honest, and I like that, I felt comfortable around him.  After he left I had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room.
Because all she thinks about are these guys she's after and I just hate her she's such a little slut I thought that in high school and I think that now. Why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all what's the big damn deal? I mean, it's okay and everything, but I don't understand when people let it control them, control their lives, why do they do that?
But he won't.
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
Fine.
I was thinking maybe I shouldn't be in therapy anymore.
What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
I wanted him to see me.
You don't know that for sure.
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
It's a sun dress.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
What do you get?
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
Your first sexual experience.
When I was fourteen.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
Cynthia. John.
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Will you lease month-to-month?
A bonfire, probably.
Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.
What the hell do you think? I love Ann. You think I'm going to tell her about Cynthia and hurt her feelings like that?
No.
Goddamit...
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
I see. Then what brought you up here?
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
Gonna cut me open?
Aw, he met her when he was lecturing at some private girls' school. They caught him examining her little tits for breast cancer in the faculty lounge. She was twelve. Don't ask. It was craziness, believe me.  They used to come here sometimes.  Don't ask.
Yes?
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
WITH LEGS LIKE MINE I'M REALLY MADE FOR DANCING
Good!  I'm gonna be there.
Of course!  D.T.V.'s most popular Hospital series featuring those perennial favorites, Cosmo and Nation McKinley. Neuro-specialists par excellence ...if you'll pardon my French. I recommend you send Brad to them for treatment!
Home?
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
Why Janet?
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
But I don't need treadment.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
I'd forgotten.
Too flashy...they'll clash with the new outfits.
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
Who?
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
I NEED SOME
YOUNG BLOOD
YOUNG BLOOD
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.
Fast!
What does he know about it?
Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy?
We love you, Baby.
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
Is it chicken?
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
Stephanie.
Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
No, I'm an actor.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
Maybe. Recognize this?
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
Huh.
When do we get to drink it?
Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.  This is the new one, right, Chris?
Yeah, that would be a good move.
Whoa.
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
She works for tips!
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
Fuck you.
So what's the plan today?
She what?  When?
To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
Did you drink and dial?
Yep.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct.  My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong.
Nope.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
I know what you need.
I say we check it out. You never know.
Let me use your phone.
What's up?
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
Hrnrnrn?
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
Sure.
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
That's what I'm having.
Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
Got it.
Good. So did I.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
Ken.
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
Morgan took a sip. It has his amoebas in it.
No dad!
Dad!
That's weird.
...I will.
You want him coming in the house next time?
Yes it was.
Yes.
What time is it?
Already thought of. Two other birds did the same thing an hour later. Not as dramatic. They lived. But you could see they hit something.
Should we make a run for it out the back?
It's getting stronger.
A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now.  They're leaving. Beat.
It needs batteries.
It's old Morgan.
They tell you everything in this book.
Don't yell at her!
I would say so.
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
You take care of yourself...  Graham.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
Why not?
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
McKendrick.
Paden sends his best.
Didn't Paden tell you that?
All right. I'm looking for a young fella, full of juice. About my size, wears a fancy two-gun rig.
Ten A.M.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
Oh, I was just checking the, ah...  ...you know, lookin' in.
Believe it.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
We didn't get that far.
He'll be here.
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
What's stopping you?
What makes you think I could?
Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
It is that.
Me too. What's wrong with us?
That's the good stuff.
Give me some of the good stuff.
What do you mean?
I don't want you to get hurt.
Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
Simone, I recognize the shirt you're wearing.  I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Almost right.
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
Hair and make-up?
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Even the fall from the plane.
Viktor, I have a feeling.  One of my feelings.  There's something about her I don't trust.
Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
-- I can explain.
Viktor, you should have said something.
I'll try.  Maybe live but remote. She'll never go to them.
She said you were very beautiful.
Excuse me?  Start?
Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
I just read somewhere --
Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
Of course, the only problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more.
How about the nudity?
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
Clyde.
Body double.
For you.  I want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale.  But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself.  She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins.  She's on the line now.
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
I have your new leading lady...  ... right here in my pants.
-- Flesh is weak.
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
I missed you.  I wondered if you were ever coming back.
-- I know, I don't know anything.
I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
I love her but that doesn't mean I need to meet her.
Lainey...
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, daddy.  We're fine with fake -- as long as you don't lie about it.
They are alive, Sayer.
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
I know what you're up to.
The background is.
She was never in New Mexico.  She never left the studio.
She hasn't uttered a word that whole time -- until she saw the big show.
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
No.  Thanks.  Absolutely.
24-hour tail on Taransky?
I don't understand.
You're in breach.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
I am the death of real.
No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
Yes.  Yes, I'm going to tell the truth about you, why wouldn't I...?  Of course, with Hank's tragic passing, the secret died with him.  I am going to tell the truth... after your next picture.
We can keep it in the bathroom.
No, just one.
Dr. Crowe.
Congratulations.
See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
Yes, it did.
Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
No.
You do?
Really?
So who moved it?
They scare me too sometimes.
...I don't know.
She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance.
They used to hang people here.
You're a stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering--
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
Not according to these.
...You any good with those?
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
Metaphysical question, man.
Hi Suze.
Aunt Edith. How did she... die?
She was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...
That's your grandfather you're talking about!  I... know what people say. Heard it... all my life.
Amends...?
Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.
Ray -- I'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.
You got something against farm people, Keith?
He started it.
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Fuck you! Who cares what sandwich the bitch was eating?
Look. You want to talk about this?
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
-- You're not making sense!! What "Scarecrow"?
It's you. You and your father.
Like your guitar break.
What'll we do?
Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out.
I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
Sorry.
Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.
New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
Shelby --
Don't worry, Chief.
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
Stuff you can never imagine. Feelings. Big thoughts. And love. Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. So, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt.
Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...
You're pretty.
Grant, no!
What other stuff?
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
Eyes on the road.
You have a great profile.
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
I give up.
Shoot.
A Texas Bear in Arkansas.  Something's up and at this point in my life, I don't want to know what it is.
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
He's after us again!
By stealing my car?
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
Uh-oh.
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.
Bandit II?
No what?
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
Six. Got it.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
Yeah?
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
Save it. We got a long haul.
Not for long, you ain't.
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
Anything else you don't want me to know?
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
You're coming up to the scale house.
Don't take that foot off the hammer, 'cause you got wall-to-wall Bears about to pour over you like maple syrup.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
Well, they're gonna. It's time this gearjammer rode to glory.  Now, move aside; good buddy. I'm coming through.
Go breaker.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
Oh.
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
So there are no guests staying on that floor?
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
Well... This is as good a place for it as any I guess.
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.
Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
I been accused of worse.  What do we got...?
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
That's right! RIGHT NOW!
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
They what? What? No. No. Why?
Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks.
-- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.
-- will be handled back in --
I don't see it like that at all.
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
Yeah, I can front this.
It's gettin' done Sid.
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
A Fed? Like FBI?
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
What else did Padiche say?
Right mafuck'n now girl. Fast as we can get you there. We wait any longer, someone goin' dead this fool.
Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
That depends.
What was it?
I wish you'd told me.
What are you going to report back to Earth?
No.
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
Just get him to stop.
Her oxygen would have run out.
Stop it.
Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
You don't love me.
No.  I love you.
I love you, too.
I love you.
I'm disgusting.
Am I really her?
Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.
And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
Looks a little constipated to me.
Occasionally.
Uh...
I'll come with you.
I came on at 8:00.
Urdu and Hindi.
How did you know?
Yeah.  It was.
I'll miss you, Mike...
Open the door, will you?
I can't open it.
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
Let's do it.
"For"...?
So.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
Just putting in an appearance then.
What?
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.
Oh, some shit.
Ellie, it was a formal party...
Did you hear what I said?!!
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
You heard me.
El?  I'm sorry.  I do love you.  And you are a lady.  I have so much respect...
I heard.
Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess.
Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
Mom and I got plans.
Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
No, no.
See?
Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Oh. Well, hang in there, amigo.
Yeah--
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
Would you cool it already?
Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
Frmpph-yrr.
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
You should write that one down.
Does it have a human name?
Oh, don't do it on my account--
I think I'd like that.
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
You'd feel what?
Oh, God, I forgot to--
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
It'll shut itself off.
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
How much do you know about it?
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become… whatever it is you are?
They never caught on.
Is you all little Adolfs?
Any news on Dunbar?
Static!
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
Who is it?
A little something what?
Take it.
We're looking at it.
You are talking crazy!
We'll know in forty seconds.  Only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy.
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
Interesting.
You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
You should live so long.
Stop it, Harry!
I said say it again. I didn't say repeat it.
They'll shoot you, Animal!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
You're crying, Animal.
It's that song, Harry!
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
Take some men and get the antenna going. Let's see if we can catch the BBC.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
Borscht?
You did!
They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
Thirty-fifth.
Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you, boys?
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
HoS qorDu. 
I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.
Population?
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
Thanks.
I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong
I hope so, sir.
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
I'll go. You have the Bridge.
What's the "Nexus"?
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
Left behind?
Soran?
I don't understand.
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
This is my uncle's barn in Iowa.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
Where are the deflector relays?
No.
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
Make it so.
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
Nothing. As before.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
I still don't...
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas.  Be tolerant.
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Gentlemen... may the wind be at our backs. Stations please!
Aye, sir!
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
He is not himself -- but he lives. He is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.
. He will remain always as he is.
Much is at stake...
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
About a dozen officers and men.
Genesis?! Whatever for?
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
Who is this?! How dare you --
I will speak with you alone, Kirk.
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
Then, how --
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul.
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday...
Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme.
Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
Is that a poem?
Maybe...
Who --
Mother, go back!
This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
You know what she'll say...
They're still running with shields down.
Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
Listen to me -- you men and women --
Aye, sir.
A few shots, sir.
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Spock?
Scotty, let's have it.
He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance.
No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
I am understandably curious.
Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this.
To be sure, Captain.
Yes.
The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
Uhura, patch me in --
In my quarters, Uhura.
Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters. I want to talk with Starfleet Command.
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
And why not?
... No, sir. It has not.
How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
I failed to resolve the situation.
You may ask, Lieutenant.
Who?
Stage Two of what?
Power levels quite low, sir.
Aye, sir.
Engine room! What's happening?!
Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
Never, sir.
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
The question is irrelevant.
Where must you go?
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
Would you prefer to do nothing?
Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
Can you isolate the wave?
We're out of control -- Rig for collision...
It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
Go ahead. Stun me.
Shields, aye.
May fortune favor the foolish.  Mr. Sulu, Warp Speed!
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
It means that they will be at risk from whale hunters -- same as the rest of the humpbacks.  What did you mean when you said all that stuff back at the Institute about extinction?
How will that be done, exactly?
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
Let's just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived.  Problem is, they won't be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year... So that, as they say, is that.  Damn.
What's what?
... Who are you?
So. There we are.
Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
Kirk. They're gone.
... Gone?!
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
You need me.
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
Quite right, Spock. Mr. Chekov, engage cloaking device!
Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
Ah... The giants.
... I see.
Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!
Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
Yes, sir.
Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.
On my way...!
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
Millions?
Just use the keyboard...
Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
Why?
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
What's the rush?
I should warn you... I've always been attracted to older women...
You're what?
For what purpose?
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
I don't know.
He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
I'm sure. Just don't forget what they did to us.  We'll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn't bother with the Federation holo-ship any more. Just get the holding cells ready.
No one hated them more than you, Gal'na.  We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years...
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
It's our only way out of here, Mister Nara.
... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
Deck ten.
Sir?
Hmm? Oh, it's just something my mother used to...
We have to find shelter...
Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
Whatever makes you comfortable...
Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --
That'll be interesting.
Bag him.
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
What?
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
We're tearing this place apart looking for them... but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the files...so far, nothing.
It'll be tight, but we should make it.
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
Active.
Main bus...
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
Jean-Luc Picard.
There's a few of us left.
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
Some.
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Fire.
Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
Fascinating...
Specifically of...?
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
We were until your torpedoes!
The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
That's a comfort...
Very much.
WHAT HAPPENED?
That isn't true...!
Yes...
I am.
Aye, sir; thrusters...
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
I like it here...
Krandog aranty.
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
Sulu!
Surely not.
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
They're dying.
Spock, I'm really tired...
What peace conference?
The Commander is an old friend of yours.
The night is young. Anyway, it was logical.  You know, you're a great one for logic. I'm a great one for  rushing in where angels fear to tread. We're both extremists. Reality is probably somewhere in between us.
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
I SHOULD have been -
This is Enterprise. We surrender. Repeat  Enterprise surrenders --
Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running.
An error.
We've been ordered to -
What?
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
I know precisely where he'll be.
Not from us!
Thank you, Mr. Scott. We were to return to spacedock, the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear.
Aye, aye, sir.
Yes, sir.
Maybe we should write them a letter?
Why?
How long is that?
It'll serve you right.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
He turned out all right.
Is he very much like you were?
I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
That was another time.
Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...
To happy endings.
Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.

The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
When this is over, I owe you a drink.

Understood.
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.
Sir, we won’t be able to bring you back. It’s a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...


I am not Shinzon. I am his Viceroy. We are sending transport coordinates.
That will never happen.
Listen to him, android. Such a small and weak creature. Yet he roars so valiantly...
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
It's working.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
I have dissolved the Senate.
And you're wondering why the Scimitar is so well armed. Is this the ship of a peacemaker? Or a predator?.
As happens so frequently here on Romulus, a new government came to power. They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly, I think they were afraid I'd be discovered and it would lead to war. They weren't ready for that.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
Why are you here?
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
And?
But surely...
Now go. I have some personal business.
It's there. The fog's thicker now, but it's there. What do you think started those fires?
Benny, this is me. I'm going to take a look.
Thank you.
Thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two.
I make maps.
He's got a gun!!
Wait, wait... What are my orders if we find this thing?
Oh shit!!!
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
So far you've let it cross the heart of America. For two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security. I don't see the humor in that.
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
Shermin...
What's all this for?
We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
Don't... don't do this... please...
Ah no.
Gear shift.
Dashboard.
Closed?
Space?
No.
How will I do this one?...
No.
Is that a baby?
Yes.
Why?
I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
Yes.
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Can I have the gun?
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
I don't understand 'friend.'
Hurry up.
The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
You don't forget anything, do you?
I gave you a baby last night.
But...
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
I understand.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
No, thank you.
You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
Goodbye.
Fly.
Maybe he's turned her into one of them. They enter the crowd around the helicopter.
You have no conception of this, do you?
The police think he was high on drugs...
Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
You know that's impossible!
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
Yeah, right.
A star is born.
Leave him alone, Tran.
A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
You're going down.
I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
What're you going to do?
Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
Tonight.
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep you out of this.
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
Thanks, Max.
I'm on her.
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
I intend to.
Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
What else you got?
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
She never gave me a tape.
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
Your sex life?
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies?
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
No it doesn't.
OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
Fire's out, isn't it?
How long does it last?  Oh.
Yeah, right, blow it open.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
Just Lenny.
But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- 
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
No, sir.
She's buried.
I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me.  Ever handle a serial case?
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
What?
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
From the grave?
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
Go ahead.
I'm hesitant to...
How long ago?
Collected shoes too?
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
I understand.
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
Dick Low's a killer too.
Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
How did a girl like me end up in a place like this?  The Deputy Director here, he believes in Tough Love. A cop's cop. Shape up or ship out, righto? Agent Kulok, when you get a chance you might want to check the victims of the recent serials. You'll find that some of them have been credited to other killers, some years ago. That's a Dave Koessler trick, find a pliant sociopath, preferably a dead one, attribute to him unsolved cases, clean up the backlog-looks great in the yearly report.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
They're all criminals?
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
Sex.
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
Sue Ann Hanson.
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
Yeah.
Got a vehicle?  Head north on 54. When you get to New Mexico you've gone too far.
Shit.
Why? You're not a real man?
Not lately.
How was it hard?
You too?
Yeah.
It does.
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
What else is going on?
Don't worry. He's in good hands.
I'm a "Dorothy".
...And she's with someone else.
Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Why not?
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Hi, Mike?
Fine... I guess. You?
...the Michelin commercial...
I heard you might be moving back...
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
Right.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
There's the rub.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
No problem.
It's like "Hi, Mom. I'm not going to be starring in that sitcom and, oh by the way, I'm Goofy. Send more money."
I didn't want to say anything.
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
No problem, buddy. You eat anything today?
No. Just O.J.
What's the point?
It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki...
Well, that's dumb.
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
Sure.
You always know the right thing to say.
Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A...
Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
S'up Trent?
Vegas!
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
They're all skanks.
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
Let's go.
Did she, or did she not smile.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
Baby, you did fine.
Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
Yes!
I gotta use the phone.
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
That was different.
How?
Oh. He's got it under control...
They're a finesse team...
You could make their heads bleed, though.
...How novel.
...Shut up, Sue...
Sue!
What do you want of me?  I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
And what is that Bonasera?
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
The gun will be there.
Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
Sure.
You understand him better than anyone.
The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
What miracles you do for strangers.
And now, what do you choose to do?
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
Don Tommassino...I should see this place.
Beautiful all over, eh?
Come Sunday morning:  My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village.
No.
Give them some money and send them home.
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
Have you agreed on a meeting?
They're talking to themselves.
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
I'm thinking about it.
OK. 
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Connie and Carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy.
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
That's not how Pop would have played it.
Probably a year...
I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
I do renounce him.
And all his works?
Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public?
Is that good?
Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
I don't get it.
It's vile.
Okay.  And did we know each other?
It's just an undercoat. 
No, still here.
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
Marge! You've got to hear this!
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.
Like Clark Kent.  Now Superman.
No!
Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
I'm prepared to take the blame.
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
Why?
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
So cool.
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
How?
You love me and you're not marrying me.
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
Sure.
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
It's Freddie. Let me in.
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
What a waste of lives and opportunities and --
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
Hello Marge!
He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
I've thought about you.
You're kidding.
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
I can't later.
Not at all. Morning Tom.
What rumour?
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
He's already angry, I don't think --
Nothing.
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
And don't forget. I have the key.
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
Huh?
It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over. 
Nah. I ain't interested.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
I can believe that.
Where do you live?
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
That's really something.
What hours do you work?
It keeps ya busy.
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
Thank you, Travis.
With the other hand, right?
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
What is it? I'm busy.
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
In the jungle. 122nd.
Yeah. From the likes of them.
What's your real name?
I don't remember.
I musta been stoned.
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
How?
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
Oh?
You would, huh?
I'm hip.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
Yeah?
Carla Pestalozzi?  No. Definitely not.  You could have posed for the Mona= Lisa.  Sophia Loren looks Swedish next to you.
You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
Wrong.
Partners.
What's that?  Mason?
Delly?  In here.
That's my girl!  Did you...?
That always used to work.
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
You look... different.
No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
Do you have the...
Nine hundred...
I don't smoke?
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
And what is the state of your memory now?
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom...
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
No.  But...
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
Can't wait.
Ah.
Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
They're...
Did you... did you...
What.
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
I'll save you the trouble.  I'm a cab.  There.  Did it myself.
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
Call me... Ishmael?
You should watch what you say.
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
So, it is a blacklist.
However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
I'm not sorry for what I said.
No, of course not, why should you be sorry?  You're the new Peter Appleton.  You exercised your rights as a solid citizen, first amendment, freedom of speech, all that.  Very noble.
No thanks.
Why not?
Well, that's not what they think.
Oh.
Oh...
My name isn't Luke.  It's Peter. Peter Appleton.
What exactly did you hear?
Yes?
Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
I think so.
How do you like our little hamlet?
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
She already has a daughter.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
And the second?
It seems so pointless.  I think I'll go to sleep. This has been a busy day.  My luggage.
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Are you coming to my party?
What's the matter with them?
I wonder if you could help me.
Try my best.
Where does he live?
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
Thank you.
Alice, I think.  Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
Thank you.
A what?
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
Yes, very.
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
I started to say... inside...
Cathy. At the school.
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
Aren't these lovebirds?
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
Yes.
Look, Mr. Brenner...
I'm sure.
Maybe.
His wife changed the channel.
San Francisco's a long way from here.
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
And you didn't come up here to see her.
Why?
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
You have a job?
Yes.
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 
I'm glad you do.
What?
Are you staying?
Well, they'll go along with anything.
Hear, hear!
No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. Your sparrow is standing on a soap box and...
I'm frightened, Mitch.
Inland.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
And he'll talk?
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
To...  To kill them.
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
I think we're in trouble. I don't know how or why this started, but I know it's here and I know we'd be crazy to ignore it.
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
The point is that no one seemed to get upset about it. They were gone the next morning, just as if nothing at all had happened. Poor things.
Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or...
Then let's go. Now!
I haven't finished my drink.
Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
Yes.
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
Where can I find him?
Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
Gray killed her.
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
You'll be a good doctor.  I know all about doctors.
The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
Don't call me that confounded name.
Maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours.  Say that you'll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here.
That's a good boy, Toddy.
The heart pumps it.
I take no gifts from you.
I would make you rich.
I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."
I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
How long ago?
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
Nonsense.  You're a fey creature with mad ideas.  But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.
He must leave me alone.
You're wrong.
Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.
The cops from my trial. They killed Lauren. The whole thing was fixed. 
Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?
Big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator?  All possibilities. Although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator.
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.
There is no scar. I'm telling you.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
No. Listen to me. Lauren found out something they didn't want her to know.  This.
Yeah, I know.
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
No...
No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
You mean Alex.
You killed my daughter.
Look, can I just call a cab?
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
Watch out!
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
Tell me what?
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
We can scare him more than he can scare us.
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
Well, sure, but--
I'll say goodnight again.
How does he explain that?
The present situation?
I was only hoping to make you understand.
Not very good news, I'm afraid.  The President accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night.  Let me read you some of the replies.  "The Premier wishes to inform the Government of the United States that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President unless the meeting is held in Moscow."  "The suggestion of the President regarding the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable to Her Majesty's Government at the present time. Representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in Washington."  Well -- there you have it.
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over.
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
Naturally I think so.
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
At the ship.
"Klaatu barada nikto."
He'll have you -- and Tom.
Well, how do I know who you are?
How long will that take?
Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
I'm gonna pray that I never need to call you.
You better get a garlic T-shirt, buddy.
The Prince of Darkness.
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
Star?...
You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.
Okay, okay.
When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.
I told Max eight o'clock.
Good!
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
-- a job.
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy.  One big happy family.  My boys... and <u>yours</u>.
I'm Michael.
Okay.
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
I know, I've felt it...
Will you give Mom a break?
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
Entertain yourself.
Wanna go to the comic book store?
No.
Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!
What about Mom?
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
Maybe.
... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!
No, you're not!  I don't trust any of you!
What's it going to do, being a plant?
Hell no.
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
You buy any of this, Blair?
How the fuck do I know?!
Garry's missing!
You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
What for?
We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
Thank you.
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
I am going after them.
And that was enough?
If he's one of those Things, we've got to get to him before he changes... Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check the outside shacks...
Bullshit!  He's got to know damn well I cut it!
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
Chance we got to take.  We got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged.
Then we go after him.
So what do you make of it?
What?!
Where?
No...
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
You know of them?
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
This is the way in?
Trust me... You don't want to see any more.
I won't leave you like this.
I will...
Created?
To work the machines and build the tunnels.  You can't imagine what it was like when it all started.  We survived for millennia, scraping the lichen and microscopic organisms from the rock with our teeth and digging for water with our nails.  Endlessly.  For generations.  And we... became.
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
No...
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
I need to... um... talk to you.
I mean... well... affection.
Trust me...
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
What?
No, I'm all bowler hat, remember?
I'm sorry, David.
What is it?
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
Why don't you come to our house instead?
Thank you.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
Good night.
And this is your "work"?
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
If you only knew...
Imagine that.
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
No...
Of course.  You're just tired. Mara, will you look after Alexander tonight?
Then it's time to change that --
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
And you've no idea where he went?
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
Goodnight, Mr. Philby.
We never should have done this to him...
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
Then how would you describe him, Beth? Merely rebellious?
[Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket.
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
My business?
You killed him?
You sure you know where to find one?
Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
Oh yeah, what'd he say?
I never touched your father! I swear!
Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up 'till today is done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs.
[Beat] What?
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it.
Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
I don't know.
[Beat] I don't know.
To the hospital.
Then, where are you going?
Ok, I guess.
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
Yeah.
Who told you this?
TV. Helps numb [makes a "crazy gesture"] any active mind. [Sticking out a jittery hand] Rudy MacKenzie.
I tried something like 30 times. There is, as STARKS rightly figures, no suitable response to that.
[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
You could still always give Becker an itch. 'Course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it, but seems to me you're saying that's about to happen anyway. [Beat] Just be careful not to walk yourself right into something.
Is it true?
Great, get in. We'll switch off in a bit.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
Thanks.
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
I'm sorry.
What?!
On what?
I gotta go to Little Rock.
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
I do believe you.  That's what I want everybody to believe.  Trouble is, it doesn't look like an accident and you're not here to tell me about it... I need you to help me here.
Alright.
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
Just some young guy.  Around twenty years old.  Dark hair.
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
It don't matter.  Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.
Shut up.
Thelma?  It's me.
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
Who's your friend?
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
It's me.
Yes.
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
I'll call you right back.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
Well, just relax, will ya.  You're makin' me nervous.
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
Yes.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
Give me the keys.
I think better when I drive.
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
But you think he fools around.
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
He's a real piece o' work.  I wish you could meet him.
Nothing.  It got messed up.
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Lemme see the map.
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!
No physical evidence.  We can't prove he did it.  We probably can't even prove he touched you by now.
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
What?  What's not funny, Thelma!
What?!  What about him?!
I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please?  You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio.
Shoot the radio!
Sorry!
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
I said all that?
What do you mean?
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
Say you're sorry.
We're fine!  How are you?
Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
What?
I'll try to be more careful.
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
Who?
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
You said it, mister.  I gotta go.
Thanks.
No, I mean
-- He's in a cage?!
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
Wow. I thought I was the only one.
I guess.
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
Really?  Very, very?
So you found Mary?
Four kids, three different guys.
Oh, uh, I resigned.
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
Turn her over to a stalker.
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
Did you study under Kim Greene?
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
I never said that.
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
It means you're too hard on guys.
Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
I don't watch the new ones.
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.
Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Just a minute.
No short game.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Toy poodle!
Everything okay here? Neighbors said they heard a lady scream.
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
Yes.
We've got bigger problems right now.
Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --
Says what, Kenny?
So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.
All right. Then I guess it's time.
The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.
I want an hour with him.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
He was.
I don't know. I don't know.
They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me.
Fair enough. But Castro's on alert and we're flying attack planes over their sites, on the deck. There's no way for them to know they're carrying cameras, not bombs. They're going to be shot at, plain and simple.
Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba.
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
Jesus Christ...
I'm afraid not, Mr. President. The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships. Admiral Anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. The Pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub.
We are one-dimensional, boring peddlers of fine carpet, Carl.
Oh, yeah -- right.
His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony.  Has to be kept for four days.
Seven.
You crashed my file?
Ray.
Check him out, Ray.
She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
Jesus, I don't know. You tell me. You're the Indian.
When did we get that?
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
Ray. I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised.
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
-- never mind Eagle Bear. We've got Jimmy nailed. Let's go!
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
His spiritual mother...
He knows me?
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
Stop.
1868...
We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
We're in there. We're in there --
-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay?
Yellow Bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. Some gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him into a corner. You're playing a losing game. Pull over.
Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
How the hell do you know?
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
How so?
I'm with someone.
It would have been really embarrassing!
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
I saw one.
Where did you see that?
It's classified. Like Hollywood says, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
Where were you?
Harmless!
Uh hum.
That's true. What are you?
What?
I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
Just good luck.
Not to me.
I like to play "reality".
Who's gonna win?
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
These guys are getting on my nerves.
What?  What is it?
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.
Yawing right.
I know!
I'm gonna go! THREE...TWO...ONE...
What do you want?
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
Did what?
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
No shit. The Iceman....
Could use a dash more jet fuel.
He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
Just once, if they take your plane away.
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
Come on. I died enough for one night.
Pulled left, rolled out, underneath.
The girl with the purple fingernails?
NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
Nope.
Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   "Maverick!"
What makes you think we can get back in?  We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.
Yes sir.
The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear?
You think I shouldn't fly.
And you get a kickback.
Who are you?
Get it, please.
He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up...
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
I know that.
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
Swallow this.
Watch your mouth, Captain.
C'mon!
Rekall?
They sell fake memories.
I did?
Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.
No, Harry, I'm already late...See you tomorrow.
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
Split up.  Find him.
How did I get in this taxi?!
Mmmm.....
I don't know.
Tell me!
All right, forget about it.
Lori, don't you understand?  I feel I was meant for something more than this.  I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody.
Take it easy.  Tell me exactly what happened?  Why would "spies" want to kill you?
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
Mars.
Come on, don't bullshit me.
Wait, did you say wife?...Are you fuckin' married!!?
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
The reactor.
I'm leaving it here.  Come get it and keep moving.
Heather and I are going to drive around a little, see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town.
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
I think I scared it!
You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...
Just barely, Pham.  What are you all doing up on your roofs. What the hell's going on?  Come back.
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.
Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
The new one!  That's supposed to be a girl!
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
Well, sure.
We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
Sons of bitches!
Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really <u>in</u> on something here!
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
I'm gonna help you.
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
No ties.
She wants to lay down.  I'm a little worried.
If that ain't the truth.  And I count on them for a little bit of stew meat...Thank you, Fred.
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
Yeah, Heather, we got you.
What?
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
You okay?
It most certainly is.
Let go of my hair.
I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.
"We"?
Shut your sewer mouth!
It was silver, with a stubby barrel... snub-nosed, I think they call it... It wasn't automatic, it had one of those... cylinders...
I specialize, Roger...
-- an angel dust dealer --
With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.
"Have to"? No...
I didn't ask for a closing argument.
...What do you mean?
Eddie... it's one thing to compare Clyde Gruner to Jesus Christ. It's even okay to claim that Shu Kai Kim is just slightly holier than the Pope... as long as you don't really believe it!
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
Everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right!
And I call your testimony hearsay. I have no more questions for you.
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
You don't drink "booze".
Nothing has. But that's all changing.
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
Exactly what happened then?
How can I tell you what I don't know!
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
It's okay, Eddie.
Jimmy Chin? Was that self-defense too?
Mr. Rabin has no right to --
Shu Kai Kim.
Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
We reconvict, your man's looking at 25 years on two counts, served consecutively. So what I'd like to ask, Ed, is: Are you joking?
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
Calls for speculation.
We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
And who were the detectives who assisted you, Mr. Reynard?
Chuckie OD'd, Mrs. Esparza. He's dead.
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
Shu's the only one I know of...
A woman.
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
NO! GOD, NO...
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
Okay, Gordon!!!
I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU, CHET. SOMETHING INTERESTING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU. ARRANGEMENTS ARE BEING MADE AND I WILL MEET YOU AT THE PORTLAND, AIRPORT.
Teresa Banks.
ALBERT?
Sorry to hear it.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Code, I've heard a lot about this.
How do you figure?
Her face had a sour look... that means we're going to have trouble with the local authorities. They are not going to be receptive to the FBI.
Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. I didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond?
It's not late, it's early. Really early.
I think that's a good idea.
Faulty wiring.
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
The usual, 9:15.
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
Donna, are you my best friend?
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
What can I tell you?
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
I can't help you there.
Cause I like it.
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
But Bob isn't real.
The pages are gone. That's real.
I'm not.
I already made you two tapes.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
What? She asked about my father?
We're on our way, Baby.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
What?
Hiking?
Exactment. They are nuts about wood. They get goofy over trees.
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
We throw away the whole head.
I forgot my books at school.
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
Stay away from me.
I always thought you knew it was me.
NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
Look at this finger here.
Bobby didn't give you this?
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
I don't know.
Nothing.
The man's an ambulance chaser...
How did you settle on the amount?
And no one will know the truth.
...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
I...
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
You may step down.
I'm going to uphold that.
Yes.
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
That's what I'd planned to...
...What difference would...
It's my opinion it took him much longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
...and you're going to do that?
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
How old is he?
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name.
That happens.
Overruled...
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
Maybe what?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Isn't there something you...
I... do you want me to leave?
Not if you don't grow up...
It's over!
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
This is Miss Costello...?
Kathy Price.
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
Nothing happened.
You know, you're pushy, fella...
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
Yes.
Where is he?
He's... you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.  He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
It's a long road that has no turning.
Uh...
Come on. Let's get a drink.
...I'm going to need your help...
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
No.
Right.
I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
Today is Tuesday. What?
I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
Yeah.
You use their witness.
The 'History'...?
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
She told me.
Should I?
That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!
Come on out!  We're friends!
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
But I think I know where she'll be....
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
It hit sideways and skidded in.
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
Don't you live at home?
I liked him.
Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
So is the town, I notice!
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
It's always been a good persuader.
From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?
If they're more advanced than us, they should be nearer the Creator for that reason!
I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.
Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.
We'll work something out.  I'm sure you'll be happy with it.
I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
Chase...
More or less.  Dylan, time to get dressed.  I'm late.
48 hours.  Back before you know it.
Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
Heather, has there been another call?
I'll be there in three hours.
Don't speed, Chase.  It's not...
No.
Diabetes?
Absolutely.
Everything is not fine!
Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp.  For Dylan's sake.
Your bed?
Coming for you...
When do you think it'll be done?
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
Steady...
Where's Dylan?!  Have you seen him?
Is Chase Porter your husband?
You're kidding, right?
Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
Uh...sure...when?
Your father?
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
Guilty.
Well, he better learn to own it. Actions have consequences.  It's not what happens here Alice, it's what they take away with them.
Gieg, Chuck.
Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.
Her name.  Bregitta.  It's poetry.
Like this!
Forget it.
That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know?
How do you know?  They might.
My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
Yes sir.
Face what?
Sometimes it gets exciting out here.
They send us because they want us to change, or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same.
I don't know.
You should tell him.  That's something he can take with him.
Is that what you were trained to do?
I can take care of myself.
No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?
Yes.  I do.
A padlock.
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
We'll think of something.
Look, save it for somebody else will ya.  This ancient shit doesn't have anything to do with me.
If it were only that simple, my young friend.  Read on, gentlemen. Read on.
What's that?
No.  Bring him on deck with the others.
What?
Long enough.
I'm not staying out here.
Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
No.  I didn't.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
Real soon... I'll be makin' the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.
Well... Yeah - okay.
Why not?
What's that?
Forty bucks...
Yeah... yeah... I guess so... That kind'a money'd get us a long way down that yellow brick road...
That's right... Take one of these.
No shit?!?! You know him?
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
Set one up.
Muchas gracias.
Whattaya do there?
Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
Only if necessary, of course, and only in my own country. 
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
Come here.
He is my sponsor. The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras.
Why not? How was the fishin'?
Oh God... OH GOD... Santos... Oh God Marietta... are you in on this?... OH GOD!!!
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
You ain't actin', mama.
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...
That don't seem fair.
You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
What happened to him?
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
What'd you say to her?
Told her my name. Then she said somethin' like, 'It's so noisy down here. Why don't we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves?' She turned around and led the way. I knew I had an important lesson to learn that day.
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
Honey, we're goin' to bed now and it's time to change the subject.
You certain?
I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
I know, peanut. But it wasn't all like you were so unhappy I was there, just you were upset. My bein' there was upsettin' to you. You had some kids there, little kids, and I guess you'd got married and your husband was comin' home any minute.
Who do?
Uh huh.
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
You're scarin' me, baby.
You knew my daddy?
I don't know... Looks like clothes.
Don't know, but she's gonna bleed all over our car, I'll tell ya that...  Hey... Hello... Girl... You gotta come with us, honey.
Not that. Look at what I wrote down cause I can't say it.
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
Few beers is all. Feelin' any better?
And Bobby too, I hear...
Rather be in El Paso than Big Tuna.
That was in Vietnam.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
Lead the way.
Damn!
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
Santos... It isn't.
Take care of him?
Just tell me what you want.
Simple? Kill him? How?
That's your business... I don't care how.
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
No...
Please Santos... Where's Johnnie?
Life is unpredictable.
So I hear.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
But. ...why didn't you say something, Tripp? I mean, what are we doing here?
He can't piss standing up anymore.
Tripp, where the hell...
Sometimes we have to improvise.
So sensitive.
So what's the problem?
Find the jacket.
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
Do you know he won't expel him?
Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings.
It's mine.
You must be mistaken.
Bullshit.
How long have you been having them?
The last month maybe.
I have to see her. As soon as possible.
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
Are you there to not reconcile with her?
How you choose to live your own life is your business. But you be careful with that boy, Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else.
Well...
So what are you doing out here?
So I'm told.
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
I've got tenure.
Whose tuba is that anyway?
Is he all right?
Sure.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
But... ?
How did I get here last night?
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
But James. I mean... How long?
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
Amazing.
It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.
Probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night.
James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
What would you call them then?
I'm not going, with them.
I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
Well, let's see if we can keep that from happening.
Even if I end up going to jail....
James'll know about George Sanders.
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
Do?
I don't know -- maybe -- I don't think so.
Jesus.
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
I think I might have.
And you're old.
Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.
It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you?
Why did you come here, Grady?
We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
Just kidding.
I doubt it, darling.
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
Booming. Lots of building going on. We can't keep up with all the work. In fact, I just hired a few new guys...
I was just thinking of... the noise.
What?
Is it because of Anna?
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
Yeah. It's really nice.
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
Oh, Anna's. It was great, man. Anna was so pretty.  She looked like a princess, like one of those girls in a fairy tale, you know, like Snow White.
When?
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
It's not what you think.
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
It's hard to describe.
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
Why don't you just tell me?
Yeah.
You can't talk to me like --
You're a cop. Figure it out.
It's a free country, isn't it?
'Fraid not.
Are you taking your medication?
You are in.
Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.
No.
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
Yes you can, Robin.
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
It's all the same.
I'd like you to keep a journal.
It was just an idea.
I wish you'd give it a try.
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
I'm afraid not.
I don't.
They usually tell me.
I know --
What did you want to happen?
I don't know!
Please don't do it again.
That's my answer.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
I don't see --
In your mind, Walter. Take your time.
Where are you?
A nap?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
I'm only asking questions.
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
I'm talking about you.
Me?
What?
No you're not.
You think I have a problem?
Between ten and twelve. Once a nine- year-old told me she was eleven. Once a fourteen-year-old told me she was twelve. I always asked how old they were.
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
Sounds like a special guy.
Their power. They seduce me.
You really believe that?
What odds?
You must hate your brothers.
I love my brothers.
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
Fine.
Prove it.
Why's it always my fucking problem?
Where're you?
Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.
I'm taking you back out.
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
That must be it.
Fine.  Be that way.
Cute, Virgil.
I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something down there.  Something not... us.
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
Tell me later.
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
Yuh?
Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
Turn it up, bozo.
Give me that!!
Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.
I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
Wait for what?
Then why don't you try it on?
And have you any other truths to tell me?
Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...
It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.
But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.
Have you decided?
Yes, maybe that is better.
I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
Don't think that I want to save myself from any embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting Anna... It's not that; it's that you can say certain things easier if you're alone. Please, Sandro, do try to understand me... It would look like I was trying to influence you, to force you, to control you... and that makes me feel uncomfortable...
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
And why did you drop them?
Once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate for the construction of a school. It took me only a day and a half to finish it, and I got paid six million lire. Ever since then I've been doing estimates for other people's designs.
Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away...
Okay. In a few minutes.
Aren't you going to change?
I'm too sleepy.
Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
Do you consider that a compliment?
But why all nudes?
You must know your third grade geography book inside out.
If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella.
Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
So that's why you've turned to smuggling, eh? You need the money. Now, I can help you. I can see that you get some assistance from the government. But first there's a little formality we've got to take care of. Just a few questions and then we can all go to lunch... Your friend tells me you dropped anchor three times...
And what did they say about me?
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Unfortunately, no.
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
Yes, we will.
Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
No.
He loves you the way you are.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
It's a sin to be fat.
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
But she watches... she listens.
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
It's not my time of month.
That was the beginning, the night of the conception. That's why she burnt the sheets.
Everyone.
Well, who in particular?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
I got sicker.
And then what?
In the middle of all the pain?
From God.
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
Agnes...
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
Anything.
Martha Louise Livingston.
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
No.
Why not?
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
I can't.
How?
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
Her headaches.
I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...
To help me.
I had a baby.
Yes.
Because I wasn't worthy.
Why?
We went to chapel for vespers.
Do you know who put it there?
Yes.
They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
I want you to remember if you can a night last January. The night Sister Paul died. Do you remember.
Yes.
Him.
Where?
Not your fault...
I hate him...
I put her to sleep.
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
You're too involved Marty.  Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
I... I'm Martha, Mama.
How did she hide it during the day?
I haven't a clue.
None as far as I know.
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
So, someone else could have done it.
And in your eyes?
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
What?
The Catholic Church...
How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
Aquittal.
Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
The sheets...
What sheets?
Yes.
Do you know what she did to her?
I haven't decided yet.
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Even Christ would partake socially.
Pipe!
Become?  One is born a saint.
Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth.  No more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles.  Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles.
Listen to her singing.
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
Why must he be anybody?
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
Why would I lie?
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
No!
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
The cards... you're bank.
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
I'm a deserter.
Just you?
Yeah?
Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.
Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
Of course I can.
Grotty?
Get him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!
A butcher?
No, straight up.
I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
Ah well. Eh, look!
We do.
He hasn't.
The big hammer?
They ought to be.
See you.
Books are good!
Parading?
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
And what's it all come to in the end?
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.
Hello.
Every morning.
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
You're a swine, isn't he George?
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Aye, well, now! 
Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio.
You've got a midnight matinee.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
What?
Is it? Is it really?
When I tell you to stay put, stay put.
But...
It's not my fault.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
Oh, a little savage, is he?
I'm not kidding.  You can get one if you have the credit.  Look just like real cows, too.
Do you remember the pyramid?
Gravity?
What's the terrain down there?
What's up?
Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.
Sure.
Play it for us, please.
I am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise.
Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!
All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Right.
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
And when will you be ready to do that?
I kind of like it.
All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust.  Hunter and I will make up the second team.
Well we better do something.
Right.
It's eating a hole in the floor!
Don't be an idiot.
Does anybody know what happened?
We can load the lifeboat up with explosives and trigger them remotely, once the lifeboat is in space.
Right.  We've got a lot to accomplish.  Let's get moving.
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
Hey!  what about the film?
And the creature with it.  We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.
We can use the flamethrower.
What's the frequency?
Who knows?
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
No, it's coming.
Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?
Good.  I'm getting you clear too. Let's just keep the line open.
Oh well... you know me.
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
Food-storage room!
I guess we open the door and net it.
What do you think?  Now we go in.
What's that supposed to mean?
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
Look...
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
Forget that.  I want you off alcohol for at least seventy-two hours. I've got some toxin build-up tests still to run.
Wait a minute.
Quick!  Run a trace on the culvert leading off the auto-shop maintenance pit.
Match it!
Has anybody talked to them?
Do it.
What?
Anything you say, Mammacitta.
I'm picking up another signal.
It's alright, it's cool...
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.
How many... how many people are missing?
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
Four.
Sure.  Do me good to stretch my legs.
Check out the tent.
I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside!
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
We won't disturb her rest. It seems she left her award in the taxicab. Will you give it to her?
And what is your name?
You're more than modest.
Please do.
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
I am somebody.
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
You take charge.
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
Just like that.
- and artistically, the most promising! Eve dear, this is Addison.
She doesn't know.
Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.
Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.
But the $500 you got to get out of town brought you straight to New York - didn't it?
She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.
You can have one at Max's.
I don't think I'm going.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
You were there? At the play - last night?
Amen.
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
Eve! My understudy...
Frankly, I don't remember.
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
Bill-
Thank you so much.
Where's my coat?
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
All the religions in the world rolled into one, and we're Gods and Goddesses... isn't it silly, suddenly I've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle...
I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
I love you too. Good night, darling-
I thought you were going to be late-
I don't think that's funny!
Of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else. You know what I think about this - this age obsession of yours - and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid-
Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?
Don't calm down.
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
Groom.
The Theatuh, the Theatuh-  - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna?  Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.
Every day.
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
So am I.
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square...
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
You probably won't believe me.
It was for my report.
Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.
I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
My husband...
It couldn't possibly interest you.
Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays.
They certainly don't waste much time.
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
I wouldn't like.
Really, Eve? Why?
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
Isn't that what they always say?
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
Let's not fumble for excuses, not here and now with my hair down. At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to... well, to the fact that she's so young - so feminine and helpless. To so many things I want to be for Bill... funny business, a woman's career. The things you drop on your way up the ladder, so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman. That's one career all females have in common - whether we like it or not - being a woman. Sooner or later we've all got to work at it, no matter what other careers we've had or wanted... and, in the last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed - and there he is. Without that, you're not woman. You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings - but you're not a woman...  ... slow curtain. The end.
I can't believe Eve said those things!
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
Margo, again...
And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.
Incredible.
Don't joke about such things.
Now just a minute-
It strikes me that Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious!
I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
I'm a human being, I've got some!
That was way back...
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
The audience will want its money refunded, believe me.
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
I mean really, deeply angry...
Go ahead, please...
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
A couple of weeks.
That's my Max.
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
--mine's better--
What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
About the past year.
Why didn't we get that?
My first day as a copy boy I was sixteen and wearing my only grown-up suit--it was cream colored. At 2:30 the head copy boy comes running up to me and says, "My God, haven't you washed the carbon paper yet? If it's not washed by three, it'll never by dry for tomorrow."  And I said, "Am I supposed to do that?" and he said, "Absolutely, it's crucial." So I run around and grab all the carbon paper from all the desks and take it to the men's room. I'm standing there washing it and it's splashing all over me and the editor comes in to take a leak, and he says, "What the fuck do you think you're doing?" And I said, "It's 2:30. I'm washing the carbon paper."  Just wanted you to know I've done dumber things than get us lost, that's all.
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
We appreciate your position--really.
That happens to people.  OK, go on.
And I'll just shitkick in my usual way.
--Colson.
Then he's got an ax.  Call him anyway.
Haldeman.
--what time is it?
--Howard Hunt?
I told you, he had to go out on a case.
Well of course.
By "they" you mean...?
When did he hire you?
On the orders of Haldeman?
At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
--Deep Throat?--
--it makes the break-in real--it's a major goddamn story--  --I'm not going to kick ass over this, but I'd like you to know I hate getting beat, I just hate it-- don't forget that I hate it--
--what about you?--
Where are your bills, Carl?
Give me your checkbook then.
...No... never in so many words...
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
Just tell me about the goddamn article.
It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
--my wife just had the baby, my in- laws are arriving, I'm trying to get the house in some kind of shape.
Go on.
The FBI thinks it's possible--the Democrats need a campaign issue, corruption's always a good one.  Get off the story, Ben--or put some people on McGovern's finances; fair is fair, even in our business.
Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record.  Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.
Well, they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel. And that could only mean the burglars didn't arrange for their own counsel--they never even made a phone call.  So if they didn't ask for you to be here, how did you know to come?
Where?  What do you mean, where?
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
Did you change cabs?  It didn't work, something moved there--
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
--yes, yes, what is it?
I think so.
Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
Could develop.
--political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
--can we use their names?--
Larry Young, a California lawyer--
He just did.
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
The what to what?
...okay...
Mochaccino.  Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
Yes ma'am, I am.
You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
You're gonna shit your pants!
Okay.  I mean, I agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?
Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
What?  No I'm not.
How did you know I was here?
You talked to Stifler?
So you're going to Michigan?
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
You got it, stud.
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.
I do, baby, I do.
Pontificated.
Went home to shit.
Yeah.
Dad, come in.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
I told you.
Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.
Okay!
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
Did you see that Central chick? Brunette?
Okay.
Uh...yeah...sorry.
I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd.
It's everyone's trick, Kevin.  But I did pick it up from you.
But you don't love me.
So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
No...I know the perfect time...
Okay.
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic.  This was before the cheesy remake.
Then where does a blowjob figure in?
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Dude, he does not.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week.  If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you.
AHHHHHHH!
Uh huh... And, supposing I believed that, what could I do about it?
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
Serafine...?
Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
So... you feel okay now?
Roussel? You mean Claude? You're calling Dr. Demento so he can come paint my face again? Fuck that.
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
Andy! No!
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
Shit!
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
My men think you died and floated away in the Seine. If I wanted to, I could let them believe that.  But that would be illegal...
Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
I told you. These murders are not normal.
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
You fucking liar!
What were you showing her?
Get on! Anastasia, get on!
I'm not sure but look. . .
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
You'll laugh.
Not you. Him.
Yes, your highness.
Yes, your highness.
Trying... to... breathe...
No!
It's not you - it's the dress!
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ...
Bartok... a question.
We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
Rasputin!
Please, if you'd just listen...
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
Perhaps you could convince her?
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
Alvy Singer. It was nice nice... Thanks very much... for everything.
This guy's on television.
It's for my brudder.  Alvy Singer! Hey! This is Alvy-
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
I prefer not to, because... look, they're laughing at him. See, so what are yuh telling me-
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
Oh, my God!  She's right! Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik? She was-she was beautiful. She was willing. She was real... intelligent.  Is it the old Groucho Marx joke? That-that I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
I mean, you've been married before, you know how things can get. You were very hot for Allison at first.
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
You know, I-I think... if I could pry this door off... We shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs. They don't run around.
Hey, that was last year.
You-you play... very well.
Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Huh? Oh... yeah.
Yeah.
Your grammy!
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Fifteen-aw, come on, you're... yeah, really?
Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.
Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...
Fifteen years, huh?
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
think that's, uh-
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
it's my first time.
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
Here, you want some?
What? What?
Yeah?
M'hm.
And blind people, crippled...
I know you've only known me a short while.
Yeah.
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
David? You call your teacher David?
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
Yeah.
Will it change your wife?
Will it change my life?
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
No.
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
Is he in the bathroom?
Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-
snow shovel or anything or something.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
What?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
Yeah.
I guess these are all yours. Impeach, uh, Eisenhower... Impeach Nixon... Impeach Lyndon Johnson... Impeach Ronald Reagan.
Commentary.
Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
I have a headache.
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
Max, the city is terribly worried.
Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.
Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
Max, I've got a hit series.
Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
We really had a good time.
Yes, I do.
And we could just sit and talk... nothing. Uh, not a big deal, it's just relax, just be very mellow.
It was a wonderful set.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
It could be freezing, it could be raining.
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
She's a constant surprise.
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
I'm in mourning.
You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
I...wait, what are you talking about?
Oh.
I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Never.
With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids.
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
Oh my God, the sitter.
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
She left a note.
Nice to meet you.
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus.
Hey!  Would you?
Are you always this much fun?
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
He's directing now.
Before I forget.  Put it on the bookshelf.
Ryan's novel.
Hardly...
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
I'll say as little as possible.
Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...
Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
Love?
About me!
It's a shit novel anyway.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
I wanted you back.
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
You're not ready.
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
Me too.
Oh, Sally Mae...
Will you make love with me?
Come on, Panes...
Don't I find what?
And I you.
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
He always has two or three going...
I'm not going to leave you alone.
Why?
How long ago was it?
Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
Really??
Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.
Would you, like, marry him?
Are you lovesick?
Oh great.
Like your business managers?
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
Well, something's wrong.
You're my best friend.
I guess.
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
Would you like to meet my husband?
Hm.
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we gotta dig.  We're not the ones in charge.
I'll make myself available...Listen, better watch out with the backtalk.  I don't know want you to end up like the guy who used to work next to me.  I'm afraid he got... <u>downsized</u>.
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
Really?
Look around, sweetheart.
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
I <u>didn't</u> choose him.  What kind  of <u>idiot</u> would...  ...<u>choose</u> who she wanted to marry?
<u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Hlllllllp!
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
Mom!
Barbatus?
I wonder...what...was it all...for...
In love?  I'm just a plain old soldier at heart.  I'll tell you what I love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
Well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper.
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
Why?
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
Eight-thirty.
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
I forgive you.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
I'll fix you some coffee.
What's your friend's name?
Baxter.
No -- it's my stomach.
They had to pump it out.
He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
Sure.
I'm not very good at it.
Gin.
I'm sure that's the explanation.
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
You are?
I don't want to talk to him.
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
I mean, after that?
Oh.
Of course not.
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
That's very flattering.
I don't know.
What kind of joint are you running?
Oh.
Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's not going to happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment --
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
Now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
Now what was your news, Baxter?
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
I got kicked in the head, too.
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
Now hold on, Baxter --
Yes?
Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab downstairs --
Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
Listen to him.  Little Lord Fauntleroy!
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
What's her address?  Where does she live?
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
Not you -- Miss Kubelik.
Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
No.
She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
Who?
And what happened to you?
You can't sleep.  Come on, Fran -- open your eyes.  Let's get her walking. We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
Yes, I know.
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
Okay. I'm sorry.
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
I love you -- remember?
Yeah, we better.
Stop that, Fran.
Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --
Atlantic City?
I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
My men --
That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men --
Men of all races -- nationalities --
Sure, thanks.
A long time.
A sauciere --
Where ?
We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
We're Americans.
Thta's not Charlie's work --
Looks pretty shallow.
I saw that Colonel's Huey on the point --
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
Would he remember you ?
Maybe.
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
Charlie?
No, sir.
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
Maybe.
But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
What?
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
Just hold up a second, Captain -- I'll get to you soon enough -- We've got things to do here.
Can you trust them?
When did you hear?
That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
I met him.
The trees, eh...
Yes, I know.
You were not coming here, to see me?
You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you?
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
No water.
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
Then let's get the hell out of here.
He's a man who knows what he wants -- he does know what he wants.
Sure.
I wasn't looking.. I was running.
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
And shut up.
I'm not ever goin' to tell you to shut up again.
We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
Right now -- I am.
I do.
This -- Bob Hope or the like --
I don't know -- don't have any idea -- I'm just the night man --
Son of a bitch, sir.
Beverly Hills --
What?
Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
Wait 'til I'm across!
Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.
43   CONTINUED:
It'll be interesting, trying to build a fire without any wood.
Back against the bars.  Now.
That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.
I bet you haven't had lunch.
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
Do I want to be with you permanently?  Yes, I think I do. But be with what you do and the way you live?  That I don't know. C'mon, Eric, until I met you, coming back to Alaska was totally
I'll tell you everything later.
Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.
Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.  Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
You want to fool yourself about that bullshit job, fine.  Damn shame you have to drag your girlfriend along.  You think a woman like that will be happy making moose stew for a man -more-
How many do you see?
It's a spring day...
Where's my ELT?
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
Don't bet on it.
Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.

Just passing through.
Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
Fuck you.
-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?
Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
Go ahead.
Stay out of this...  Doctor?
Tell me how bad it is. I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better...  and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and...  you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
It's not your table. It's the place's table. Behave. This once, you can sit at someone else's station.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
My son is sick, okay?
I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
Yeah... Well...
What job?
Just let me talk.  I'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth. I'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have... in how you are with Spencer -- Spence...  ... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good...
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
Last word freak.
Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?...  Just tell me.
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
What's he look like?
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
Get out.
Come on, sweetheart...
Never a break. Never.
Another place where?
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
What restaurant?
Okay, don't.
Tachlinkov.
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
That's right.
Why don't you tell me.
Bain!
The contract was stolen.
I know.  It was a joke.
Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
It cost us.
$1,000,000.
He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
Ten million --
Turn off the engine.
No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
Just Electra?
Why?
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
Why not?
Then you went freelance?
Here?
How was the beach?
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
Except --
Yes.
Ten years ago.
What happened?
You didn't take it.
Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
So?
Nobody ever sees me.
No.
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
Because, I'll take it.
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
It can be.
Who was she?
I'm not sure that I care anymore.
Martin.
Oh, God.  I see it!
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
Holidays are our busiest days.  No one likes to be alone on holidays. I know I don't.
No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.
Sure.
Shit... oh well.
What are you thinking about?
I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't that funny?  I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one.
And an R.C.
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
Yeah.
No, you guys are great together. He'll come through, I'm sure.
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
What's that? Free!
You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
Like Custer huh?
These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
I thought that was part of the charm!
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
Yep, except a name for this place.
'cause you stink of booze.
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
No, it's welded up!....Let's take a look from the inside.
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
No, not if you've got better things to do.
No, I figure once they see the place and we get'em a little drunk, they'll all want to help. We should have that floor done in a day or so.
Both, see you later.
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
Tell me some bad news?
Now you're using that word.
Lucky break!
I'm not hungry, really.
We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
No!
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
How about you Brutus?
Whatever!
Alright, I'm coming. It's the perfect place Jahn, thanks.
I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.
There's nothing there for me.
Hey Chris, keep an eye on things.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Sure, they are students.
Can we charge admission?
Donations only! And make the thing non-lingual, so everyone gets a handle on it.
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
Insurance!
What is bail?
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
I figured you more as a Socialist?
I had it coming from someone.
Are you sure I shouldn't get a doctor.
Run into Josh?
Fuck you!
No!
You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
Yeah!
Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.
Yeah.
Maybe it is!
Well come on, sit down.
We're not sure...
No. You're with who you should be. It's like she chose you.
-- I like the car I have.
That's over. Way over.
You.
-- This your idea of small talk?
Good, cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person.
-- Your act only works with an audience.
Like me.
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now.
Yes. And?
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
When I have something to say.
You.
Why not?
We're doing something -- ?
The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement.
Where?
You planned this --
Where? Why?
I'm not going back to school.
Up to?
No.
Dad --
I don't want to see her hurt.
No.
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
How -- how long does she have?
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
I'm no dummy.
I'd do that --
How would you do that, Mr. Carter?
I'd work backstage or something?
Then you remember more than I do.
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
Yes, sir!
Have we ever met before?
Uh, hi....
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
Yeah. Maybe so.
Look, Marty, I'm just not a fighter...
Mr. McFly here wants to nuke it all, just so he can see it!
All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
Home, school, here... 
Get behind the shield! I'm about to release radiation!
The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.
Is Shemp all right?
Sure, he agreed quickly.
Uh, Marty Lewis! I almost didn't recognize him -- haven't seen him in years.
Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
What if you lost your keys?
I don't know, but I don't want to take any chances! Now you stay here and don't do anything. Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone, don't go outside. Understand?
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.
It'll be fine, Marty.  You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...
Curious...  Very curious.
Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.
According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
Sure,.
You expect me to believe that?
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
Nope.
Is that right?
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
Okay.
No.
Sure.
There you go.
Bring it along.
No.
But it would hurt.
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
Yeah, me too.
How's he doing?
Well, I'm not going down there and look.
Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
Well, we'll see about that... Hey, lookie.
Anybody ever done that to you before?
Positive?
I'm serious.
No.
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
Just a second now. That's your truck. isn't it?
Forty-six Yoyodyne employees.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey, 11/1/38.
Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.
Not me. No way.
She wants a picture.
What is it, Tommy?
New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy if you want my opinion.
The door's locked.
At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
She was killed, Penny.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.
You look!  It's not here!
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
Why me?
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
Cause Buckaroo needs me here.
Asshole probably got lost.
You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his – what about before that?
Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
I – I've got respect for – for working guys, like you –
I...
All right, forget the heads. Where's Mundt, Fink?
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.
...Huh? No, I'm –
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected –
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night – if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
I'd say you're already enjoying some.
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
Damned difficult, I'd imagine.
Doesn't surprise me at all.
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now –
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
I can feel my butt getting sore already.
Frequently played, seldom remarked.
See you, Charlie.
Charlie. How are you.
You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine – you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
Seems like nothing but, lately.
You're leaving?
What a dump...
I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to –
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink – you're a goddamn write-off.
Must be.
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
Huh?
Yeah.
How's about it, Bart?
All night?
Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi.
Thanks.
It's bullshit.  You know it is.
How about the coke?
No?
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
What else is new?
Who?
She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
I know who you are.
I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him.
About a year and a half.
Were you with him last night?
Did you leave the club with him?
If that's the way you want to play it.
I don't smoke.
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
I have nothing to hide.
No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.  I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow.
But you didn't hurt --
No.
You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
I don't know.  But you do.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
Only in theory.  You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter?  Not in theory -- in practice.
Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
Do you?
Why not?
I'll meet you there.
No?
Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
Did you miss me?
I'm writing a book.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
Why not?
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
Yes I am.
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
Nilsen?
I never heard of him.
Not now he don't.
What are you doing here, Pop?
Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta my head for years.  Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems.  One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as honey.  Said she didn't know why she done it.
Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.
What is it you got between you?
That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head.
She's right.  You got an icepick in you yet?
Are you vice?
Can you check again?
Can there be some mistake?
Why, so you could humiliate me?
What about the shit they write?
Saddle River, New York!
I think it's in New Jersey.
Well, have you asked her to come back?
People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.
Annina Nosei.
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
How about right now?
I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment.
It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.
You have a bunch of them, don't you? Albert Milo walks in from another room.
Decipher?
You're not?
No, I'm Haitian-Puerto Rican.
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
Thanks.  Your dad called again – something about a job.
What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'
I do.  I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.
Manzanita....  ... if one day I die, and you read this piece of paper, I want you to know how much I love you. Although I'll never see you again, Gypsy, Gypsy, your hair, your hair, your face, your face'
You're back.
I'm your family.
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
How is he?
You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
I'd like to squeeze your titties.
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
You don't even know me. I want real respect.
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
Alright, thanks.
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
I think I'll take the stairs.
"Shreck's."  You --
We do.
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
What're you really after?
Things change.
Didn't I say that?
Yes and no ...
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
I'm listed.
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
I don't know anymore, Bruce ...
Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
Oh, him again.  He's already history -- check it out.
You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
PMS.
Well it's not working.
And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
Okay, you have a point.  Plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves.
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
Oh no, those things frighten me.
Not all heroes wear masks.
Oxbridge Academy?
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
Just the beast.
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
Presumed dead.  No one knows.
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
But he's never said a word-
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
And she did it all for me.  For love.
She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
You leave Batman and Robin to me.
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
Then you never loved me?
I think they're getting worse.
I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.
I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
The _Rolls_?
I shall be near at hand. Should you need me. And sir, I know it's difficult but try and have a good time.
No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
Precisely. So this number is probably some kind of calling card.
Exactly. Mr. E. Mister Edward Nygma.
Tonight's a good night.
La'chiem.
Slanta.
Wacko? That a technical term?
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
He sure did.
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
Stop fighting.
I figure telling that cop I'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. So no offense but thanks. See ya.
Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me.
Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
What I do isn't about revenge.
Yesssssss. I know!
The coin _wants_ to decide.
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
Take me. Let the boy go.
What are you talking about?
... A hundred and eight?
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
No.
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
... Looks like a convention.
I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
That's it?
Strong stomach, huh?  I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.
Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint.
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
His face.  Allie, look at his face.
Oh, Bruce...
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
Allie, he's not.
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
Did you really ask?
I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it.  Stupid thing.
Hi.....  Roses.
Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
I can understand THAT. Neither do I.
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
Well, bravo!  What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team.
We have.  In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world.
Quite right, sir.
I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
Of course not.  I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement.  A loss I trust Bernie will be able to reverse.
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
Sean Connery.
Sure.  You're right.
Sure did.
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
Why thank you sir.
And I'm sorry you look that way, short-ass.  That suit stinks and you obviously dye your hair.
Uh, huh huh... We'll do it, sir.
Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all gonna die!
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
Yeah, we should party.
Yeah, really.
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Huh huh. Jack. Huh huh.
C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
Bunghole...
Yer late.
Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Thrr...
Did you give him a full cavity search?
Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
Cut the power!
Deep and hard.
That's better. Yes?
Jesus jumped-up... Bork, can you imagine what would happen if they set that thing off in our nation's capital, or even worse, if they sold it to some damned foreigner at that conference.  Well, it's not gonna happen!
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
No, I'm not putting up with this.
You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
You know you're really a pretty girl.
Then it should be here.
... we wouldn't have had our little accident.
All right.
Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles.
You don't know the Deetzes very well, do you?  My father bought this place.  He never walks away from equity.  Why don't <u>you</u> leave?
I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
W... We didn't know how to make one.
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
We tried.
Start simply.  Do what you know. Use your talents.  Practice.  We only help those who help themselves. Just do a little at a time.  And of course, practice, practice, practice.  It's tricky but -- you weren't murderers by any chance, were you?
Are you Juno, our case worker?
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
What do you expect?  You're dead.
Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
Step... mother.
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
They're dead.
Yeah.
Just <u>say</u> it.
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
He's your cousin.
I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
I think she's in with them.
My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
... sheets.
Don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me.  I'm an <u>artist</u>!  The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!
I'll need something personal of theirs.
Yes. I think so, too.
... Straight out?
Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Yes. Thank you.
Yes. I lost my remote control.
Oh... Well, I'm very sorry...
... Mentor...?
So am I, Eve.
... I have very few friends, Chauncey... And Benjamin's friends are all quite a bit older...
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
No, Eve. I like you to be here.
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
I certainly do.
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
... Maybe one day you shall find yourself in a similar position, Chauncey... Maybe one day...
No, Ben.
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
And now, Chauncey, I'm afraid you must excuse me - I'm very tired all of a sudden.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
I like to watch.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh. Thank you.
No.
Yes. I have seen styles on television.
... Yes. You can take me.
Yes sir. I'll take care of that.
I hope so.
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
Yes. We need a very good gardener.
Yes, Thomas - I understand.
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
I see...
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
... How long have you been living here?
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
How were you paid?
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
... Oh, really...
Yes, I will.
Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to...
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you.  Is Eve around? I'd like to say hello.
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
Yes, I did.
Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!
Oh yeah, he's good.
I don't know.
Oh, I will, and I have many, many friends and associates, my friend. All, by the way, in Overeaters Anonymous. All of them fat and alone like me, all of them dream of being someone else, all of them with John Malkovich as their second choice!
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
I want to try.
Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
Suck my dick!
You fell in love with her first.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
Sure. We could really use a farmer. We'd be grateful for the help.  Also, I think, you know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly, a little puppet show every once in a while, would do a lot to lift our spirits. You know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly.
Let me try!
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
I said "yes."
That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
I just wanted to say “hi.”  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
Maxine.
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
Two hundred dollars, please.
Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Fork ah did?
Thank you, Floris.
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
But of course.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
Maxine...
What's the play?
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
Do you mind?
No, I guess not. I'm an actor.
Yes, Maxine, yes.
Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?
I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
You've got to be kidding.
There ain't.
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
Say the Word!
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
You saying nothing counts?
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color.
That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
She gone like they say?
Yes ma'am..
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
In case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad I can't get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after. Anything.  Don't ask me what whitefolks need at night.
Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right?
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
No, let her rest.
Won't you be late for work?
DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
He's sleeping in the church.
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
Her who?
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
You planning to do anything about it?
No use thinking these things now.
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
Leave off..
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Huh.
Shit.
Well maybe you and me could pool our resources--trade information-- professional courtesy--compeers, you know--
Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.
That is for the urn.
I'm going home, Donny.
Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.
What's that, Walter?
Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
I've had a--
Yes, uh, very impressive.
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
Heh-heh--
Yeah.  Thanks man.
What's your drink, Dude?
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
You're not interested in sex?
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
Oh, no.
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Well--sure, I could do that--
A hundred.
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Dieter has been on the fringes of-- well, of everything in L.A., for about twenty years.  Look at my LP's. Under 'Autobahn.'
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
Huh?
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of rest.  Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll!
Thanks Walter.
Huh?
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
Fuck your sympathy!  I don't need your sympathy, man, I need my fucking Johnson!
Not exactly a lightweight.
Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny.
And the fucking money!
Huh?
Yeah, and you were--
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
Shit!
Yeah?
All right, get out.  Both of you.
You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!
A world of pain.
This is a league game, Smokey!
He's half yours, partner.
No.  They've been training to hunt you.
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
Then who does he work for?
I don't know about this, man --
He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
Well you've got it, warmblood.  Now what the fuck are you gonna do with it?
You experimented on your own, son?
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.
Nope.  Back then we did not.
Going on twenty years now.
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
You should've killed her, then.
How can you be out here?
You're blind --
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
Preventive medicine.
You get used to the darkness.
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
He is an abomination!
But you use blood banks --
Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
He killed them?
Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's DNA to mutate. They've been using them to treat Sickle-cell anemia.
Hey, folklore--
What do you mean?
--Anna--
I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
Not the only things missing, Nick.
That's a joke?
You sure?
Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an <u>old</u> tree.
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
Anna--
What?
Just...try and go back to sleep.
Whatever you want.
--yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
Just let me get my coat off--I had eight cups of coffee, I'm wired for sound here.
--fuckin' A right--
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?
No fucking.
What're you doing with all this shit?
Still don't see it--
Heather, does that look like Domini there?
--Domini!
--a Wiccan--
Fine.
This isn't about us.
<u>What</u>?
First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
--great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
We're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged Blair Witch "sightings" --the Parr House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek.
See what turns up--which I guarantee will be nothing. Some of the rest of the party are more hopeful--
Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.
--and we brought it back with us!
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
Then I have no idea.
Still working on it.
No. Elly Kedward's not the problem here, I don't think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch--
I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.
Anna--
I thought all witches were benign and good.
--thank you for calling--
I am?
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
Yeah.
Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?
Yeah? What happened?
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
Channels, we got two and six. Two don't come in so hot.
I told you. I like you.
...Hell.
Yeah.
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
Fine. Suit yourself.  ...Having a good time?
...What kind of fish?
You said the usual--
Right.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
Meurice...
Yeah, well, I may be getting in over my head here, I mean you're the geologist, but my theory for what it's worth, you got all these volcanoes and each time one pops it's the equivalent of what, twenty, thirty megatons of TNT?  Enough to light Las Vegas for how long?  How many years? Course, I'm no mathematician but--
Tuesday.
I've seen a few.
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
You did? A human ear?
Yes?
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Is Sandy part of this?
Yes sir.
Then, shut up!
Oh he forced you, huh?
Pest control. gotta do your apartment.
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
Yes.
No. What is happening?
Then don't talk about killing.
O.K.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Whatiya mean?
Dorothy. no!
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
What?
They hurt his head.
Who, Dorothy?
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
What kinda beer do you like?
What else is new?. right?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
I don't know.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Now, how are you going to do that?
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date. that does that.
This is not my usual Friday night!
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
Goodnight.
You want to go talk to him?
Shoot.
Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
uh uh.
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Yeah. okay.
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.
Dejen la maricada pues!  No jodan! Nadie va a matar a nadie!  George, debemos hablarle al Patron, es la unica manera, mano.
Derek!
I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
Are you kidding?
Baby, you didn't have to come.
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
Tell me about the suitcases.  What is the make and the color?
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
Excuse me?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
Fuck you, then.  I sign nothing.
What's that?
Me, too.  Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is no good.  But we are roommates, okay?  And we must talk to each other. I am arrested for stealing cars.  For the grand theft auto.  Okay?  So, now it is your turn.  Now you will tell me, okay?  You will tell me why you are here?
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you accomplish your dream.  But yet you failed.  Why?
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
I talked to Foreal, Diego.
Coke.
Today.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
Mexico.
I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
Family.
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
I'll tell her.
That's where you belong...
Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?
Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.
Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
What's happening to us?
No, never.  Don't even think about that, it's impossible.  I love your mother. And you are my heart.  Could I live without my heart?  Could I?
Do what you want, it's a free country.
You mean, like a trip?
You swear?
You swear?
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
I know, Dad.  I love you too.
Let the record state the witness has identified, Diego Delgado.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and I have no more concerns.
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
Stoned?
Yeah?
Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.
Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like it.  I'm fucking wasted.
The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
It depends on you.
They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.
I don't even know your name yet ...
Not enough.
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
It's a question of habit ...
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
But it's not even midnight yet!
Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
For many months, I've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... And naturally, I am under the illusion that I know you somewhat. You never seemed the type, Kader, inclined to performing useless actions.
No. Let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. But from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. By now the game is over. The NLF has been defeated.
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
What about the will?
Then you can go.
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
But there's more?
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Like cats and dogs.
Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
I didn't hear it.
The opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an objective view.
Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
I assume his girlfriend.
Yes.
How did he look?
She was here?
About a year and half ago.
Doctor Steven Trammel.  Cardiologist.
Intense.
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
Why not?
She said she was going to fuck me like I've never been fucked before.
Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson?
I suggest it never happened.
I mean she only screwed me two or three times a night because she had to -- I'm sure she didn't enjoy it.
Chinese peony root.
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
Then what happened?
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
He did.  Look, I know you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink -- but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough  -- and well...
Yes -- cocaine.
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
Yes.
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
Then you would have gotten your money?
You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
Yes.
I know.
That's not an answer.
No -- not at the office.  I've got a better idea.
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't it?  To let go of what you want?
What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
No -- I'm a survivor.
How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me.  After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in.  That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?
I'm supposed to be on vacation.
I love you too, Dad.
You better.  Please answer the question.
If you want me to.
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
Attractive.  Bright.  Distant. Charming when she wants to be.
No one's asking you not to work.  I just think you could make some time for your son.
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
I don't know.
Not even if they're a dork?
Doesn't matter. Move on.
Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
No treasure maps, huh?
Aw, Betty.
Mom's orders.
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
This happened way before we both got married. I... I can't believe it.  You think she had sex with him?
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
No. We're going to lock this up and --
I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
I never knew that.
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
I'll get right on it.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait.  I just have to get my shoes.
Oh.
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
Francesca. Robert.
I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Must be nice having kids.
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
You sound like an artist.
Do you miss it?
You must get lonely at times.
No. But I love them just the same.
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
Oh, sure. Great.
I'll pick you up.
I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
Couple. Want to help?
How about if I set the table?
No.
I sat outside and had coffee.
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
What about us? What about me?
Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?
But now that you have it -
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
I was paying the check. She ran outside. I told her to wait for me right here! Oh God, where is she? Rebecca!
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Died there?  How?
Keep smokin', fool.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
What it will be.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't need any partners.  I don't need new product.  And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
Then fuck it!!!
You mean as opposed to your life?
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
All the more reason I should be here.
Why?
Back here.  At the end of the block.
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
I didn't sell it.
Well, somebody bought it.  That's what I heard.
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
No more thoughts from your asses.  Or I will burn your asses and snort the ashes. Hear me?
You haven't?
Potential toxic dump site.
You're pretty black to be growing up in Rossmore Park.
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
Two point one seventy-six.
Where is it?
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
All part of the business.
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
Jesus, Caesar!
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
You're right.  You don't have to tell me, if you don't want to.  I just hope you understand you're among good people here.
Don't be silly, Caesar.  It'll take five minutes.
It couldn't have been.
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
All right, Caesar.
I've seen the way he looks at you. He's always wanted you.  Maybe two million dollars finally bought you.
He can't kill you --
Don't try to tell me what to do.
Shut up, Violet.
Let us go and we'll make a deal.
But everybody is all right.
It's all right, sir.
What?  How about a drink?
Why?
I could be lying.
Caesar, you still got the money?
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
I heard you working in here and I just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee?
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
Oh, he went home to India, but as far as I know he'll be back.
I knew it.
Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind.
I wanted to apologize.
What?
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
What you heard wasn't sex.
I think so, too.
Even though he knew about you?
He was in love with you, right?
Shelly said it was over two million dollars.
I am, but ...
I didn't say that, but since you did, let's say that you are.  It would have been easy to set Shelly up.  You could have got him killed knowing that Caesar would bring the money to the apartment.
Do you think you know me like that?
I think ...
In his office.  I saw it this morning.
Who is Gino?
What did Gino drink?
You are as radiant as ever, Violet.
Pop?
Hey, Johnnie ...
Don't worry about Caesar.  I'll handle Caesar.  You just get out of here, okay?
Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
I thought you were never going to do that.
This doesn't go upstairs.
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
...they won't let you go...
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
One moment, sir.
Yes.
I think not...  No, I'm sorry.  It was very sudden. He was here very briefly.
Did you?
Yes.
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
I hadn't heard.

Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
I don't want anything but a ride. All I want to do is go home.
I won't hurt you.
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
Listen to what you want.
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
We're about an hour away.
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
No.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
Yes.  That's who I want to be.

So get the hell out of here.
Fine.  But I'd like to sign in.  In fact, I insist on it.  Where's the book?  I gotta sign in -- 
Get everyone down in the basement.
Enhance it.
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
No.
Uh - what? - I ...
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
...ditioning.
... get to it.
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
Mr Helpmann!
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
Tell me about Layton.
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
They weren't at school with us.
We don't make mistakes.
Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it.
She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
How can I act naturally, when you've trying to break my arm?
What?
They'll be there waiting.
Security.
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
Oh God! What have we done?
We? Don't blame me!
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
Where are you going?
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
Really.
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
What! Shit!
You want to take my console into your office?
I'll tell you what .... You tell me what and I'll do it for. I'm a bit of a whizz on this thing. 
A woman eh? I see.
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
I won't be held responsible.
We're meeting Mrs Terrain.
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
Yes. Not my department ... I'm only records. It seems that Mr Buttle was overcharged by Information Retrieval. I don't think they usually make mistakes ... but, er ... I suppose we're all human.
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
I ... uh ...
It's a 27B/6, what did you think it was?
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
Can you fix it?
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
She say she in great pain.
You can trust me on this one.
We are virgins.
He's not a cop, he's a medic.  I'm CY Coates.
Got a beer?
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
Ten-four.
No. He's dead.
What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
Oh man, Bucky.
The pitch, high heater. Bucky knows what's coming. He steps in, smash, over the green monster.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
We moved out after that. Upstate.
You asked me not to come.
Promise you won't go inside.
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
Come on up.
The ghosts--
I think the worst is over.
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
I need a drink, that's all.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
Yes.
C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
I've taken that into consideration.
You okay?
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
That's ridiculous.
What?
That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
Keep it to yourself.
You have the job you have...
Okay.
What?
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Ravenous homosexual.
No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
Because nobody invites a bad- looking idiot to their bedroom.
Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?
Can you believe it?  I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups.
Not because you have to.
Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
Do you feel good about it?
No.
Then what was good about it?
Aaron, will you tell me?
It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
Yeah.  Well...I think it is important for you too.  Sit down.
Let me think a second.  It's tough.
What do you think the Devil is going to look like if he's around?  Nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long, red, pointy tail.  No.  I'm semi-serious here.  He will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great God-fearing nation and he will never do an evil thing...he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important. Just coax along flash over substance... Just a tiny bit.  And he will talk about all of us really being salesmen.  And he'll get all the great women.
Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
Speaking.
You're just trying to say all great stuff so I'll feel even worse that you're not around.
Your hair's a little funny.
Wipe me out?
I could do it this Saturday -- everyone wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner.
Move away from me.
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
Almost immediately.
And Bobbie says...
I spent a fortune on this.
We could...
Well, who knows.  Just let m tell you what my favorite teacher ever, told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be wonderful.'
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
I could use somebody to talk to on a day like this.  Sorry. Go ahead.
No.  Not even you.
You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?
Yeah?
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
I'll be the judge of that.
Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...
What?
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
Because you're nuts.
Where are you?
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
You want to come?
Then you should stay here.
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
The way you were looking at me, I just went.
Whaddya mean?
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
What did he do?
Walter!  Jeez!
I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
Walter, I'm sorry...
There's...a body inside that statue!
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
Enough already about it - get to work!
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
You might talk too much.
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands.  Are you listening to me?
Did you see my cat?
You're like an undercover guy!
Telling you what?
Relax!
Here here!
Why not?
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.
Oh, OK.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
Wrong answer!  No prize.
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
Yeah, I guess.
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
Benny was right.  You guys are all exactly the same.
That's me.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Cafe Blase.
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
China.
Sporting events, yeah.
Okay.
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
Not if you're careful.
Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
Football is my life.
Nicole...
Later for it.
Hi.
Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The limo never showed, I thought he might be here.
I heard she got straight A's.
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
I gotta bail.  You coming?
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
I don't think so.
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
Big League pitchers don't use these.
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
Catch?
Much better.  Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me.  This is progress.
It's all the same thing.
Nuke?!
No.
I'm trying to play with your body!
I think I'm ready for the Show.
Don't worry.
Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction.  There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
That's my job too.
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
He' s confused--
Aren't we all?
It's possible.
There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
What's it say?
It says he's not bending his back on his follow-through.
He'll learn.
Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?
We gonna fuck or what?
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
I thought I was--
Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.
He did know.
I told him.
God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
Go for it.
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
You're the boss.
Learn your cliches.  Study them. Know them.  They're your friends.
Jesus.
Then go.
Let go of me!
Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
My right.
I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
Yeah, thanks for everything.
She's playing with my mind.
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
Better find our bonus baby, eh?
It's a miracle.
Was I at that dinner?
Excuse me.
Hold on a second.
...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
She's not here, Sam.
702 472 1862.
Well...
Okay.
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
If his girlfriend was knocked up.
Eight.
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
All right.
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
Listen, I would -
Nicky wanted to take over. He wanted to go after Gaggi, go after the skim, go after everything and everybody.
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me!  That's the only reason!  Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker, you!
I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.
Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
No problem.  Sorry.
Well, that's why they paid so well.
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
What is it?
I-I'll do it.
Hello.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
Thank you.
Good luck.
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
I - I - I...
No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
No, he didn't.
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
It's under...
All right...
With the money.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
Yeah.
Let go of me! Let go of me!
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
You threw it away?
I had a... salad.
Fuck you.
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
Not gonna let me in?
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
Bullshit! Bullshit!
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
Okay, I'll -
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
You're firin' me?
I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
No.
Can you do it with your left hand?
Is this yours? Your pen?
Yeah.
Mm.
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
Don't fuck with me, Al! Don't make a fuck out of me! You want to embarrass me and make a fool out of me?!  You didn't gamble?! Tell me you gambled the fuckin' money, I'll give you the fuckin' money to put the fuckin' heat on! Did you gamble?! Huh?!
Shut your mouth!
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
I'll to the FBI!
Hey!
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who you're fuckin' with?
You've gotta be kidding me! 
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 
Stay out of the way!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
What?
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
All right.
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
I do.
Okay.
Oh, come on.
It's all right.
What? What?
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too.
Everything went to his head. 
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
Thank you. Very nice.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay, then.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
Get up.
Yeah?
This is Nick.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
Did I say to do anything yet? I said I'm not sure... I'll let you know. I want to think about it. Where're these pricks at?
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
How you doin'?
I'm positive.
Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
Since when do you talk like that?
Having a good time?
It's okay. Let her go.
You're probably right.
What's the matter?  What are you saying?
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
I suppose she does.
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?
Winning.
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
Well. I stand corrected.
How could I forget. Mammoth--go pet the kitty.
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form.  If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical "missions"...There is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won.
Men, huh?
What's the name of your child's best friend?
What did--?
Actually, yes.
Hey, I thought...
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
Yes, Mother. Dear.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
I don't know if I can do it alone.
Any place.
Taking messages.
That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
You could've made me lose my call.
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.
Not this minute.
<u>You're</u> doing all the talk.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.
Give me 20 minutes at least.
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
Who smashed the phone?
Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
Who?
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
26th off Wilshire.
What are you doing now?
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
Tell me what she looks like.
I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
Why tell me this?
When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Shit.  You couldn't be in much worse shape.
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
You were at the Emerald that night?
You wouldn't --
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
They did some great job of reforming you.
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
We can be there.
308-9962.
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
Talk to the man.
Call me "Nels."
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
We're gonna get there first.
None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
Seems not.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
Doesn't everybody?
Thanks.
What you think?
She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
Hi, Jimmy.
Maybe he wants something.
Fucking men, Col --
No, of course not, she's a lady.
It's a simple question.
What's it to you?
I'm not on my own, am I?
Yes, please.
Tried to. Sit down, will you?
Are you jealous of him?
Didn't think I could.
I am.
He did sometimes.
Yeah.
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
Tell him it hurt --
Shut up.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
How?
Whenever. Tonight.
So I got it wrong, then.
More than that.
Want to change you to a man, Dil...
No.
Yes.
I'm going home!
You knew which man?
Your soldier.
Died...
It was you...
Stop it, Dil --
Got to be somewhere.
Tell me you love me.
Then say it.
You do?
Fergus.
I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
Yes.
Can't remember...
Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
Absolutely. Long as she can keep it. Isn't that right, James...
Do you now.
Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on. Have a heart.
I know.
No way, Jude. I'm out.
And what if you don't?
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
Thanks.
I understand.
Good.
My pleasure.
Can't we take it off?
Only joking.
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
No?
Not in your nature.
What?
Suppose you could say that.
So what were you fucking around for, then?
I'll bear that in mind.
Hurry up, would you?
Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you.
Like having a pint in the Metro --
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
But they will. As sure as night follows day. They have to. I want you to find her out. Tell her I was thinking of her.
I told you not to talk that way --
Stop it --
A story.
Faster than cricket?
I said you bastard -- stop --
Got to catch me first --
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
That true, Fergus? You in love?
First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!
It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
I think that's what you ordered.
No -- I guess not.
Why do you think I brought you here?
I sure am. Get it.
Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late.
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
You mean spies and things like that?
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
Oh.
Who?
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they --
That's the spirit.
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
You'll wreck your raincoat.
Come on -- I've got something that stings like crazy.
Would you like to see my passport?
Yes, but we're divorced.
There -- you're a new man.
There must be some way.
Okay.
What are you doing?
But I'm not through complaining yet.
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
Who?
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
What -- like Scobie?
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
What? Assassinate somebody?
Shut the door!
Go on.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
I'm afraid it is important.
Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy --
What do you want?
I don't know.
Where did he keep his money?
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
I wish you wouldn't.
Is that all? Can I go now?
Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded.  Sylvie!
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
Oh no! What man, Jean-Louis --  where?
No -- but I will ask.
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
How did you find out?
Instant divorce you mean?
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
Come on. You can't stay here.
I'm still having trouble with English.
Lay on, MacDuff.
How about once more around the park?
How would you like a spanking?
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
Of course I'll help -- I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now --
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
Ça alors! From Charles?
He took care of Charlie for us.
Who invited you?
You do?
I get the imports.
No.
She's my daughter, Tom.
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
Better than a pile of dead teenagers.
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
I want you to head right home after school.
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
You never went, uh, all the way?
No honey.
It can't be.
Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.
St. Michael's.
Can you get inside?
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
FINE. Are you?
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
I can't right now.
Follow me.
You heard about that?
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
Don't you think it's sick?
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
I do not.
I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
You didn't believe her?
People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
NO!
Just thinking about something.
Ok.
Told you to hide it.
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
At least somebody likes this shit.

What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.

It happens to this piece of shit...
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?

You mean to tell me you hijacked me with an empty gun?!
All right.

Well, then, that means it's call...
Hey!  Hey!  Andy's Ice Cream.

 Oh...
Hey!

Oh, shit.

What?
...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
You all right?
Are you all right?

Reach into my pocket.

 Okay.
 I'm sorry.  I'm a little

It's melting, man.

 There's gotta be...

Thank you.
Ooh.
Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's for you.
...frozen!  So if you don't mind--!
And it won't be pleasant. 

I did what I could for you...
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
We've got it...
Is it--?
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've...
Went away? 
And let me guess.  You failed.
So far, ye-yes.
Forget about him.

Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
Well, then, how about a ruler?
I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
Oh yes.
It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
What about her?
Just find the girl.
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
What are you talking about?
I think I'll kill her.
I'll just tell my wife.
Jake, listen.
Shut up, Duffy, you're always in a hurry and his friend says why not do what the Chinese do? So he says what do they do? His friend says the Chinese they screw for a while. Just listen a second, Duffy...
Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here saying she was Shirley Temple you'd say okay to that, too.
Why?
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
Thank you...
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
Looking for someone.
I'd like to talk to him.
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
I don't.
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
Yeah.
Do me a favor, will you, Lou?
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
Of course.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
No.
Yes.
Oh... thank you.
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
Mr. Gittes.
No reason.
Never forgave him for what?
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
Is that unusual?
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
Working for the District Attorney.
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
Just... I have to.
You saw my fa... father? When?
That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
You mean she just found out?
Yes.
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
Who is she? And don't give me that crap about it being your sister. You don't have a sister.
She's my sister.
You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
How about a plane?
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
Ida Sessions.
Okay.
There's just one question.
Help yourself.
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news.
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Do you know me?
Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
Water and Power?
Gittes.
Since lunch.
They were partners.
But that's what you told your wife.
That right?... She used to be some looker.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
...and turn into a piece of charcoal!!
Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable.
Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!!  Good thing Germany's closer than Russia.
For example, at this moment the film's out of focus. Go see.
That's right, Modern Times.
Toto, sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing. So it's better to shut up.  It's hot in here. Toto, take me to the beach.
No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! Life's not like you saw it in the movies. Life...is harder.  Get out! Go back to Rome. You 're young, the world is yours! And I'm old...I don't want to hear you talk any more, I want to hear talk about you.
Whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little... 
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
For you to fall in love with me too. Listen carefully. Every night, when I get off work, I'll come and wait beneath your window. Every night. When you change your mind, open your window. That's all. I'll understand...
Who?
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
Politics. He's the district representative. We met at the University in Pisa.
He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
I can't take shorthand.
Oh!
These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
Huh?  Oh, I forgot - you've been away so long I forgot about your joking -
It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money.  Thatcher!
Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
Don't I always?  Most of the time?
September the ninth?
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
Yes, Mr. Kane.
It's - all over -
He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected.  To start with, I'll break your neck.
What are you waiting here for? Why don't you go?
Hmm!
I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
You really don't know who I am?
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
Oh, me -
Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Well, I -
Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.
I mean in New York.
You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
Mrs. Kane, I'm not asking you to believe me.  I'd like to show you -
It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro? 
Yes, sir.
Go ahead.
Why, Brad?
No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily.
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
The personal note is all there is to it.  It's all there ever is to it.  It's all there every is to anything!  Stupidity in our government, complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people.  They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.
What check?
You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
Well, thanks a lot.
I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
Am I sure about what?
What the hell is that?
Unnhh!
It's not the same.
This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
You work in a market, all right.
What about Sing?
Sang.
Call the police.
Well, I don't know if sorry can make up for it. I found your remarks highly offensive.
Well, he missed!
Peptic ulcer.
Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
That's cheating?
What do you mean?
Empire.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
How do you mean?
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
Yeah.
And the second time around...?
She's in here?
Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
Which ones?
The best Burtless movie ever made.
FUCK!
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
Number six.
What!?
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
Who found him?
He made it, hunhh?
Reach what?
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
I want to rent a movie.
May I be blunt with you?
There's a difference. Those were obligations. Obligations that could not have been met at any later date. Now renting videos-that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store.
It's going to have to do for now, considering that it's my car that's up for request.  Can I help you?
What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
I like to expand my horizons.
You're bullshitting.
I'm not. She just left.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
Fuck you.
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
What responsibility?
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
Fuck you. Fuck you, pal. Listen to you trying to pass the buck again. I'm the source of all your misery. Who closed the store to play hockey? Who closed the store to attend a wake? Who tried to win back an ex- girlfriend without even discussing how he felt with his present one? You wanna blame somebody, blame yourself.  "I'm not even supposed to be here today."  You sound like an asshole. Whose choice was it to be here today? Nobody twisted your arm. You're here today of your own violation, my friend. But you'd like to believe that the weight of the world rests on your shoulders-that the store would crumble if Dante wasn't here. Well, I got news for you, jerk: This store would survive without you. Without me either. All you do is overcompensate for having what's basically a monkey's job: You push fucking buttons. Any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs, but you're obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important, so much more epic than it really is. You work in a convenience store, Dante. And badly, I might add. And I work in a shitty video store.  Badly, as well.  You know, that guy Jay's got it right- he has no delusions about what he does. Us?  We like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here, just looking to pick up a paper or-God forbid- cigarettes. We look down on them, as it we're so advanced.  Well, if we're so fucking advanced, then what are we doing working here?
Helluva day.
I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Yes.
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
I'm her sister.
Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.
Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
No, she's getting married.
To you?
Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.
A half hour.
It's not my store.
We were going to start again, I think.
Maybe.
I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
Actually, it is kind of rough.
Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
I said go ahead.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Ooh! Can we?!
Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
It better be up to and including me.
Who?
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
Jesus, would you stop? You make my head hurt when you talk about this.
What do you mean?
Why do you say that?
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Thirty-seven?!  My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks!
Sure.
Good.  I'll see you when you close, then. Enjoy the lasagne.
Can I have your name please?
What's this?
I didn't do that!
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
He is.
Now feel his.  Roll up your sleeve, chief.
Shit!  Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her.
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
You'll be missed.
Screw you!
I... I don't know what to say.
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
Bye  That was Snowball.
Exactly, cheesehead, exactly.
Y'know, Jessie, doesn't Frank look like a normal guy--but he's not,  are you Frank?
You're getting warmer!
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
My pleasure.
Fine, I guess...
That's it, you look like a professional.
You're not gonna die.  Grab me with your other hand!
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
Oh, please.
Where've you been?
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
I don't think you do.
Excuse me?
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
A flare up...
Flare up of old emotions...
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
I burned it.
No, he's close, and he's using our money to keep you alive. Nobody's worth that much on the open market.  Except you, the loyal one.  Didn't I tell you to warm the place up?
Tucker and Walker.
Who's going with you?
What the hell are you waiting for, goddammit!  Don't you see what he's doing!  He's hijacking the shipment!
There, what's that place?
Down there you buy a life, up here you earn it or die.  How's your health?
He can't be far away.  Find him. Go!
What did you do that for?
Then, by God, you have been sent here by providence. Tortured in prison, then thrown out to be tortured by the Police. My heart goes out to you, poor, poor boy. Oh, you are not the first to come here in distress. The Police are fond of bringing their victims to the outskirts of this village. But it is providential that you, who are also another kind of victim, should come here. But you're cold and shivering. Julian, draw a bath for this young man.
Good evening.
Great, sir. Great.
And you, sir?
My wife... Alex freezes.
No. She's dead!
Julian. This will be these people now. Alex gets up.
No, no my boy. No trouble at all. Alex slowly sits.
Missus. Very pleased to meet you.
Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
It's alright, thank you.
Well, we go round shop crasting and the like, coming out with a pitiful rookerful of money each.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
Good.
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
You're gonna be sick are you?
Crime?
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
Do you mean Church of England?
Blue eyes?
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
Something like that.
Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
I just say what the other person would say?
I was quite enjoying that.
And when do I get out of here then?
Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
Prison custody?
Sir.
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
Big, big money.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
What?
Sixth is faster.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
You got a deal.
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
Soon.  But I take little ones all the time.  Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
Dozen times a day.
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
Yes.
I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
Then let's have it.
I'm sorry.
You tell me.  I had to toss the list in the river.  I was protecting your sorry, long-winded ass.  So why don't you show a little courtesy?
In fifteen years, I have never left a customer unsatisfied.
Wouldn't dream of it.
He could'a been depressed.  It still doesn't tell me homicide.
So?  It was a random thing.
Of course I'm proud.  You know he started with nothing?  Look at him today.  Playing concerts.
Vincent.  It was nice to meet you. Visit again?
...show me the wallet, man, get your ass up, <u>up</u>...
Maaaaaax!
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
It got crashed!  I didn't...
Yeah, yeah, sorry...
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
I see your point.
Why not?
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
The trunk?
I don't think I can do this.
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
Believe it.
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
I don't understand...
I'm not catching a melody.
Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
In case <u>who</u> checks?
Dmitri?
Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
That's jazz, my friend.  You said it yourself.  So don't tell me you don't know how to play between the notes.
Why?
You had to kill Heller?!
Who's Heller?
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
One more.
Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
Any special reason?
I love her so bad.  She just... wrecks me.  I would die for her.
Why the hell not?
Just drop me off.
Mississippi?
I gotta go, Flip.  Thanks.
Sure was.  Pounded the V.C. for this Greek cat named Ari Onasis.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
Yes!  Don't let's get into this thing where I have to repeat myself!
Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
<u>Heart attacks happen</u>.
I noticed.
Surprise me.
Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
Absolutely not.  A good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy.  If you can figure it out, they screwed it up.
Uh huh.
Who are you, Jerry?
So what's the question?
How is it possible?
That was him.
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
Did you kill my father?!
No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
I'm sorry.
You saw me standing alone ...
Without a love of my own.
You knew just what I was there for.
Don't do this.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
<u>Liza</u>!
You're here because you figured I might show up.
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
Well, I don't know if --
The truth shall make you free.
Only on the football field.
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
You sound so sure.
Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
You don't understand --
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
Yeah, I do.
That you come with me.
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
No doubt.
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
It was a worthy experiment -- worthy of you; I was wrong about that part. But it's over now.
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
You mean --
You were right, Ellie.  You were right all along.
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
This... seemed best.
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
I'm not sure.  You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
You want to classify prime numbers?
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
That's what they all say.
Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
You sonofabitch.
You too.
Like it or not.
Like it.  Almost there.
But the machine worked -- that's what I've been trying to tell everyone!  The tape -- it's all there, if they'd just look at...  ... the tape...
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
What'd you think?
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
Maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isn't because science has obscured it... maybe it's just revealed it isn't there.
I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
Thank you.
What is it?
What?
-- I don't know --
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
We work down in the ditch?
I got two years.
Yeah.
I don't know, Boss.
She's got him! You hear that?
Fasten your flap! All you Newmeats gonna have to shape up fast and hard on this gang. We got rules here an' in order to learn them, you gotta keep your ears open and your mouths shut.
Drag's been chain-ganging so long he's got a nose like a bloodhound.
I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap...
Thass right. Just play it...
Come on, boy, come on, darlin'. You kin do her. Just let that ol' belly sag and enjoy itself. Stay loose, buddy. Eight more, between you and everlasting glory. Little ol' eggs, pigeon eggs, that's all, fish eggs practically.
Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
Gettin' up, Carr.
Call.
Damn.
Well, how far didya get?
That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
Stop acting like a silly little fag!
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
Yes.  I believed him.
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
I never carried a gun!
Doesn't work that way.  You had your chance, now fuck yourself...
I don't have it...
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
Oh, I think you will.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
If he's not out, why are they here?
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone.
Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?
Then what do you need me for?
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
It's not chronological: Son of Sam was before Hillside.
Ruben's dead.   So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he...
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
Go and look for a note.
They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
Over here.
Who prescribes the brandy?
We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's phone.  I know you won't mention it.
Who came in after you?
Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too young.
Because I think I'm wrong.
How'd you get in on the deal?
No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...
We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
He was a chemical engineer with a food company.
Outside in the visitors, car park.
You should have gone to the funeral.
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
One of my suitors.
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
Isn't that rather too close...?
Are you still involving me in your crash?
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
Patient.
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
Then that's even more reason to listen. Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes. 
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
Then, you should call.
Really?
Yeah, it'll be fun.
I'd have to see it on.
You look beautiful.
It'll be fine.
I know.    I know.
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Paul could pop the question at any time.
Oh, Letty, what happened?
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
It's good exercise, Mom.
Don't be fresh.
Just remember that I love him.
There's a spider in my room.
Lie?
It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
Anything interesting.
A small price.
Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
Do you?
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
Aren't you ever quiet?
Let's try out the bed.
That's Mr. Beast to you.
You got wine. That's great.
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
Oh, God, Michael, I know.  Why does everything have to be so hard?
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
I mean tonight.
That's a load off my mind.
I've met someone else.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
I'm really sorry.
Or, of course, you could take a sabbatical the rest of the year.
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
No. I have it. The lamp? The one with your fingerprints and her blood on it?  Remember?
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
I thought you wanted Zammito?
Not today.   Where are your friends?
Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?
Good.   I have a job for you in America.
C'mon, Laurant, America?
What?
It's Daniel.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
And?
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
I assume you want something?
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
Thank you.
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
Everyone get some sleep.    We're leaving in the morning.
Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
And the other car?
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
I've never driven a Cadillac before.
I'm not going to leave you.
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
Me?
You lived there. You know the city.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
God, I want to go home.
No!
I said a clean break.
Yeah.   It's mine.
No shit?
Feel free to correct him if you want.
J&amp;B?
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
I don't know.
It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it.
Something like that.
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
I'll go and make up his room!
Then leave her to me.
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
Why do you want to teach me?
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
And if I use them to kill you?
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
Long.
I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
How so?
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
Let's end this here.
All right.  If you can take back the sword in three moves, I'll go with you.
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
First I must visit my master's grave.  It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet to avenge his death.  And yet I'm thinking of quitting.  I must pray for his forgiveness.
Perhaps.
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
You're right, but I don't know what to do.  I want to be with you... just like this.  It gives me a sense of peace.
The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs.
You buying?
Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
I knew that.
You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnut's chocolate you, know.
It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.
We'll discuss this later. Obviously.  You left the door open.
I dabble.  May I?
In a better place.  I hope.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
Leather purse...
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
Who got himself what?
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
To be sure.  Now tell how your friend died.
Did you know Sebastian well?
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
Got a boyfriend back home?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
That's a matter of opinion.
At this hour? I don't think so.
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
That's none of your business.
You're not gonna start that again.
I will.
I can't win with you.
You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
Yes.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
I love you.
- none taken -
Are you shitting me?
I'll see you tomorrow.
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
Do you want to learn or not?
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
That's one way of looking at it.
I want to go home.
I'm taking a shower.
Need any company?
Want a blow job?
I know.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
I don't know. He was just so charming. All he did was talk about how I had killer legs and how we wanted to photograph them. Things just got out of hand from there.  Mom? Are you there? Mom?  Mother!!!!
Get out of here.
Yes!
Who is this?
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
Racist piece of shit.
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
Interesting.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
I'm aware.
Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
Morning.
Well I know how it went with Cecile. She won't shut up about it. How'd it go with Mrs. Jesus?
Exactly the opposite.
So what went wrong?
A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to be rectified.
Where'd she go?
Tell me all the details.
What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
I think you have your answer.
Is that so?
Oh... no thank you...
We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
No. I only let her go with Edward.  It's alright.
I can see it all...the very day it began. Amy was lonely; she was desperate for friendship. I remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring. That must have been the day she first wished for a friend.
Are they nice?
I really don't know, but I do know that you must return the ring. You get Edward to take you up there and bring it back to the old lady.
What's her name?
Irena.
I know that.
Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
I forgot I had it on.
Yes, darling,
That's right.
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
But I told her to go with you.
You do that, Edward.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
I live right here.
Yes, I did.
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
You called me by my name.
But you must!
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
That's a fine-looking ring.
I wouldn't be surprised if it were a true wishing ring.
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
But I don't want you coming here alone. You get me to go with you when you want to come here. You promise?
Mommy read it to ne.
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
Yes, yes -
Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
Wait a minute. Listen.

Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
I like to see her happy.
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
Oh, on my wrist.
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
Uh huh... good thing those cops didn't see that.
Rule one: always wear make-up.
I look like fuckin' Chewbacca.
No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.
I haven't gotten it yet.
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
Hide him.
You're such a good friend.
No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
Oh come on. Knock it off.
You don't have to pee.
Yes I do have to pee!
Frida, you know you're it for me.
I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
It's Mark.
Come on Frida, I'm not kidding. I'm totally fucked. Let me in.
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
No, she died when I was twelve.
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
Oh my god, by wolves?
Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
Goodnight.
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
They do? Oh no...
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
How big?
Packages of money.
She's just so... pathetic.
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
So now being with Frida is lucky? I thought you said she was a flake.
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
Nah, man, I'm just saying, you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
What of?
Not really...
His wife.
How will we interrogate them?
Well, sir...  I don't know exactly.
Yes.  This way.
You wonít regret this, sir.
Iím sorry...
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno, I can't remember.  Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again...  Now, please leave me alone.
What is that door?
No.  Have a look.
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
That's right.  I <u>am</u> your doctor.
Not that again...
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
Why?
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
No more than the usual.
Oh... Okay.
Right and don't embellish.
I promise.  I won't.
I mean,  if it's a problem...
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
... What?
Like how?
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
Are you out of your mind?
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
I'm going to kill him.
He was only doing his job.
Jesus...
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
We're not upset with you, Dave.  We think you did a terrific job.  Don't we?
What happened?
Oh.
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
He's not.
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
The Fidelity nonsense...
I just fired Bob Alexander.
Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
Oh, come on, Bill.  Don't patronize me.   I'm not one of your little...  Turn around.  I'm talking to you!... Turnaround!
I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
Mind if I sit down?
No.
I don't mind.
Yeah.  Is that funny?
But you could go to jail for it.
I can't.
It's nice.
Dammit...  I told them no mayo.  See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don't want to do that...
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know.  Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.
The tunnel.
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.
That sounds like a curse to me.
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
No. They just try to hold you for ransom. Fuck you, Moses! I'm outa here!
You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers.
Look...I know you have no reason to trust me. I've got friends in the Cave. I got some stuff comin' out this mornin'. I'm gonna try to get off the island.
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.
They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
Don't come.
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
Well, no shit, Sherlock
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
What?
This is better than sex any day.  This is romance!
Nuwanda, what is going on?
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
What is that?
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
Seize the day while you're young, see that you make use of your time.  Why does the poet write these lines?
English.  Way before your time.  It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you.  I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
Again!  Louder!
YAWP!
You can't live a life for someone else, Neil.  You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me?  Have you shown him your passion about acting?
Are you kidding?  He'd kill me!
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
It's not too bad.  It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
I can't just forget her, Pitts.  And I certainly can't think about math!
Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here.  And you'll be approving loans till you croak.
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
I'll take him over mine.
Yes.  But
They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
Oh. 
Yes, and acting!  It's got to be one of the most wonderful things in the world. Most people, if they're lucky, live about half an exciting life! If I could get the parts, I could live dozens of lives.
Boat or no boat...I'm going...
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
And no questions asked.
That's where my boat's moored.
Just trying to get to my boat...
Jesus Christ lady...
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
You people...rich people...
Thank you, I work at it...
Self sufficient...
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
Takes one to know one.
A meat locker.
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
You don't take orders very well, do you?
I don't take orders at all.
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
Forget them...
Shut up, man, just shut the hell up! I gotta think! I gotta think!!
I don't know...you got what we need?
That way.
Seafood salad.  You ever operate a jet ski?
And you got 10 minutes before this thing livens up a boring evening.
Get the boots.
We're all going.
I'll get it! Where is it?
You're full of shit.
You're full of shit!
So he's in the next one, Albert. I mean take it easy. I mean you're driving everybody nuts!
Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!
She does not!
You mean...?
No. None of that.
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Who's got the ammo?
Merle, hey Merle, you got any socks?
Worse since she talked to him.
Will you marry me?
Okay.
I don't know.
No.
I made you a sweater.  Here... You have to take that off.
Naw, it's... I mean...
Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
Nick.
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
There's Vince!
Right.
So do I.
Yeah.
Fucking A.
I don't think about the shot that much.
Hell no!
Huh?
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
Hunt with Vince?
What are you, hoping?
Merle...
Sit down.
Here! This is it!
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
See you Monday.
John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out?
What?
Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
The fuck I did!!!
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Wade did a little reminiscing.
Avon Lady!
Who are you?  What the fuck do you want?
Your mother.
Shucks, and I got all dressed up.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
I've also drafted a letter to families of officers killed in the line of duty.  They'll need your signature.
Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.
Yes.
Technothugs.
How then?
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
Good night.
With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
How do I look?
I'm signing off.
What's it mean?
Take a look at this.
What's your name?
The -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends?
He lied to me again.
You know that you're in my house.
Young man -- you got me there.
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
Why? It don't hurt.
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
All right, darling.
That's just too bad --
Not me! 
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
The seventh day of April --
But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
About what?
It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Ahem -- Neighbor Stone, we want--
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
Don't be cross with him, Ma. This don't happen every day.
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
But Jabez, I never said that!
Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
All right, Jabez ...
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
All right, son -- if it helps.
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
Oh, go along with you! As if it mattered to a grandma! But p'raps you got an even chance.
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
You'll be a father any minute now.
Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.
Let him try it.
Mary -- Jabez --
Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
Me?
Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
I object.
I want someone to talk to ...
You can talk to me ...
So, you divorced of what?
It's corny, but I could live with it.
I'll find someplace.
Ellis, what have you told them?
Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
Go fuck yourself.
I told you...
If out plan works...the FBI will get rid of it for us.
The only thing left for them is the City Grid...  ...They may not do it.
That's okay...  ... I have an eye on his private bathroom.
Don't I always?
I'm ahead of you...partner.
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch?
It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
Hey, you couldn't know.
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
Gene, Jesus, what a bull he is!
Heidi, I'm dying.
Don't call yourself fat.
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
Oh, yeah, I will...
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say?
You're crazy.
You're really crazy.
Where you gonna go?
I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
I gotta listen to it if they think...
Are they on the phone still?
Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!
I'm afraid.
What are you doin' in there?
Who's this?
I'm not alone.
Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
Sonny-boy, one word?
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
Well, armed, then.  Nobody's been hurt.  Release the hostages, nobody is gonna worry over kidnapping charges, the worst you're gonna get is five years -- you can be out in a year.
Calm down, you're not ...
They were ...
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
Okay ...
I can take care of that.
Okay, don't worry about it.  Stick it in the bag...
Gimme the traveler's checks and the register.
I took too long.
It's locked on the inside.  It's through that passageway and to the right.
You and me are checking the other ways in and out.
They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
If you take anybody, please take me.
We like you, too.
Are you a lawyer?
Everything's all right?  You okay?
Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?
My body?  What for?
Get 'em in the vault!
What?
I want him to think that.
Alive.

What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
Get over there!
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.
Gimme the black guy...
I speak what I feel.
What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
It's not a joke.  I got this terrible fear of being locked in...
Who the hell is that?  God damn it! What the...
Not now, Mom, please.
Did Pop come down?
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
What about, ah, non-union occupations?
Okay, newsman.  How much you make a week?  You're not talkin'.  You payin' me? What have you got for me?  We're givin' you entertainment ... what are you givin' us?
I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me?
<i>That's the crew. They follow us.</i>
On a raid. If she wants to see justice... we gonna take Domino to the Jungle, baby. <b> EXT. JUNGLE -- NEXT </b> The El Camino pulls into the entrance to the JUNGLE. The neighborhood of LOW INCOME HOUSES winds upward into the HILLSIDE adjacent to the wall. Ed parks the El Camino next to the curb. <b> INT. EL CAMINO -- NEXT
Yes. <b> INT. KEG HOUSE -- CHAPTER ROOM -- NEXT </b>
I don't know. They might be dead already.
You're trying to scare me into falsely incriminating myself... and it's not working. I said I'd tell you everything I know. You and your friends behind the mirror.
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
What was your business with Lateesha that day?
This is your last chance. Tell us everything you know.
Stop it.
Hello?
<i>We gotta go to work, Domino.</i>
You have sixty seconds... here's the question...  Which one of you is Frances?
No. What's the big deal?
Son, with the exception of Spring Break in Tijuana, have you ever ventured outside of California?
They're gonna edit it together out of sequence so it's more exciting. <b> EXT. BEVERLY HILLS -- LATER ON
Your theory is valid... <i>in theory.</i>
Who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street?
No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
Turn that JUNGLE MUSIC off.  We ain't in Africa.
It's about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria.
No!
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
What makes Sammy run?
Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
Eddie, you're too smart for your own britches.  Listen to me.  How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor?
Wake up!
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
...peanuts.
That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch!
What is?
Can't do.
I would like to get paid now.
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
Sal, I want my money.
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
Tina, what do you want me to do?
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
Lie down, please.
Sounds funny to me.  As much as you say nigger this and nigger that, all your favorite people are "niggers."
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
It's e-vit-able.
Well, fuck you, too, and fuck Michael Jordan.
I don't know.
That's what I think.
I ain't getting shit.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
You listening to me?
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
Mookie, you're fucking up.
So what if this is a Black neighborhood, so what if we're a minority.  I've never had no trouble with dese people, don't want none either, so don't start none.  This is America.  Sal's Famous Pizzeria is here for good. You think you know it all?  Well, you don't.  I'm your father, you better remember that.
Whaddup?
Yeah, I think.
Depends how you define 'new'...
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
Just down the hall.
Very good. Back in a jiff.
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
Is that what I think it is?
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
No.
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
The second R is silent.
You brave soldier.
And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
She did not.
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
Will not.
Don't look directly at him.
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
Sucks for you.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
You're right. Hey, thanks for the jet pack. Your fantasies are so much cooler than mine. Bye Mom.
Go away, assface.
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
A turd.
He must be on his way to pee out a fire.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
I don't know who we are anymore.
LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want.
You're a great teacher, Lloyd.
And with that complete loser
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
Oh I think you do.
You're just jealous.
This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
"My dream date with Principal Collins."
Can you believe it?
Skateboard.
Do we have a deal?
Uh-oh. Harry?
It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
Will that be on the midterm?
No.
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
What?
What the hell are you talking about?
But we don't drink from the house do we.
And I you.
We start our own class?
Yes!
And...?
What papers?
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
Are you going to kill her?
I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
Basically...
Sire!
Not sorry enough.
Is this what you seek?
If you'd fought one whit below your abilities I'd have scratched you a good one.
They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
Your Reverence.
The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
No.
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
Always?
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!
Did they try and fail?
Those sounds could be imitated.
"Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
No.  I never drink -- wine.
I have no next picture.
The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
I think she's a honey.  Look at those jugs.
No thank you, Eddie.  I'll be alright.
Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde!  Ah, I've always wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde!  I'm looking forward to this production.
Yeah.  You pull the strings --  "Pull the strings"... hey, that's pretty good!
Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
That's good.  I could use the money.
Nah.  This happens all the time...
Don't worry.  I'll do something.
"Beg to differ.  This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --"
Forget about it.  We'll make our new movie, and you'll be a star again.
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
Correct.  So instead, I stayed here, waiting for my comeback.  Always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one.
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
After I did "Dracula," the studio offered me "Frankenstein"!  But I turned it down, the part wasn't sexy enough.  It was too degrading for a big star like me.
I wrote something special for you. I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so I wrote you a new final speech.
I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.
It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
That's great.  Let's do a take.
Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.
Nothin'!  I told him he was great.
You <u>can't sit</u>!  You gotta walk around, with good posture.  You want these people to think we have class. Otherwise they'll <u>never</u> invest in our movie.
What?
Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?!  What kind of sick mind would operate like that?
Oh, just like in the script!
That's right...
Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your landlord.  Could you please open up?
I'm real sorry.  My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account... C'mon in, I'll write you another one.
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
We're escaping!
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
Confidentially, I even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties. I'll tell ya, I wasn't scared of being killed, but I was <u>terrified</u> of getting wounded, and having the medics discover my secret.
Who?
You look beat.
A few years ago, I actually saw him do "Dracula" live.  I thought he was much scarier in person.
Okay?
Well you tried --
I was a fuckin' HACK!  I let people recut the movies, cast their relatives...  I let Bela down...
Yes!  BINGO!  Solar energy!  Oh that's gonna seem so scientific.  This movie's gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film.  <u>No compromises</u>.
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
You're <u>sure</u>???
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
Come on...
Yeah, so... ?
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
This is real, Bananahead!
You know it.
Stand back -- I'm about to do my Happy Dance.
Ed --
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
I'm telling you, it's peaked. Ed TV is an over-inflated balloon. Get it off before it explodes all over us.
Yes?
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
Who?
We're falling behind.
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
Your brother's here.
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
Right.
So he killed himself.
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
No! And that girl has a name.
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
He says --
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
And what did he come back now for?
Who?
Mom?
Oh God. What hospital?
Shari, Ray feels --
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
You batted or you bunted?
No, no, I -- as soon as you came in tonight I said to John, "Boy Shari looks beautiful." I said it on TV so you can ask anybody who saw it.
Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
Shari, I really like you...
Where?
Come on...
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
The what?
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
I know. I mean I'm sitting there and her father's asking me about my "career prospects" and I'm playing "Risk," with her kid brother, Leon and at dinner the dog's sniffing at my balls -- at least I hope it was the dog. 'Cause her mother disappeared for a while.
What are you drunk?
What?
Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here?
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
See, they should've picked him. Look how comfortable he is out there.
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
Ray --
I know.
No. Am I supposed to?
What...
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
By the X.
He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
What kind of person?
Thank you.
Here, get down.
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
What?
What?
Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
Thanks, Mr. M.
Oh.  There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.
Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
well, I don't know.  It could have been anybody.  There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard.  You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs.  Or Doug Schenken - what about him?  Or what about Tammy Metzier?  Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that.
Why are you lecturing me?
You will.
Oh yeah, you bet.
Oh.  Okay.
And how did you get in the school?
I have proof.
You sure?
Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
Three twenty-five.
Yeah.  I'm here.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
I'm not like you.
Sorry.
For what?
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
You know, I don't understand why everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the time.  She was always super- nice to me.
Thanks.  You too.  It was great working with you.
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
How'd she meet Patchett?
Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
No.  I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.  And that's all the news that's fit to print.
Forget I asked.  It was a mistake.
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
Yeah.  But not for long.
Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
Dudley, what do you want?
<u>What do you want</u>?
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
How?
Homicide?  A detective?
It's confidential, Bud.  Like that magazines Vincennes scams for. <u>Hush-Hush</u>.  I'll see you tomorrow.  And hey, if it works out, you'll get a piece of it.
Which one are you and which one am I?
What about him?
Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this.
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
Man, what're you saying?
Say what?
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
Where do they get their stuff? Come on.  Give me one to feed the D.A.  Just a little one.
In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The trunk under the carpet.  Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
No.
Get on it.
No.
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And smart.
Even I'm not that crazy.
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
What are you talking about?
Why do men and women usually see each other?
He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
On what evidence?
What's Dudley's scheme?
At Christmas.  We had fought.  I didn't like her boyfriend.  I -- she has a birthmark on her hip.
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
Jack!  It's Christmas!
I like it!  I like it!
Jackie, are you back on Narco?  I need copy.
What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
He's queer too.  Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues.  On screen and off.  I'm getting him to fuck the D.A. for a hundred bucks.  That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career.
Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
What happened with the kid and Loew?
I just called it.
Yeah.  Me neither.
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
When can you get it here?
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
Rachel Banks?
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
I don't know what that means.
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
I'll pay you.
Move it.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
What do you mean?
I told you no calls.
How'd you get around the tap orders?
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
Them.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
Same thing?
<u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
How?
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
Who's calling?
It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.
I'm married.
I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...
Remain calm.
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
The robbery.
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
Not that I could see.
Yes sir.
In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
Yeah.
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
It's okay.
Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--
I know.
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
Stacy--
I know, but listen--
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
You opened the thing?
Oh Christ.
Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
Oh.
It is fish.
Do you like fish?
Not that much.
It's how he works.
I'm sorry about that.
It's not me?
You're a moron, you know that?
Who <u>are</u> you people?
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
Otherwise you may have to what?
Shut the fuck up.
Seat 74.
I don't under--
The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
Can I open 'em up?
No "900" numbers.
Did they take your clothes?
What about jewelry?
I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?
Bobby--
Bobby--
Why would the NSA--
I don't know!
You're tired.
Jerry--
To the cops?
No. No, it's okay.
I need help.
Because we, and our associates, have paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to shyster lawyers like you, <u>because</u> of shyster lawyers like you, and we'd just as soon sit back and sip a beer while you get ass-banged by as many people as possible.
There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. <i>American</i> buildings. <i>Americans</i> getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!?
Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
Sir--
Dean's with Lyle.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
If they've looked at the video.
I don't know what's going on, but if you people have tripped over your own asshole again, you're not gonna get any help from us. It's ending at your doorstep.
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
No.
I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
You felt obliged to.
Pardon?
In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
Yes.  Absolutely.
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
Good.
What?  No!
I can't work.  I can't sleep. Lady Hampton calls impatiently.
You will.  You will.
Dance with me.
Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
We've got to get you out of here.
It hurts too much.
I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
Oh dear.
Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.
And the people here don't want us. Are you kidding?  The Egyptians are desperate to get rid of the Colonials…  - isn't that right? Their best people get down on hands and knees begging to be spared a knighthood.  Isn't that right?
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
That's your name innit?  Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish?
I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
No.
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
I'll have some of your water.  It's hot.
What?  How could he have?  When?
I can get in the back.
And you've forgotten yours.
I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
Very true!
Me?
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
Oh really?
I'm fine.  I got hot.
Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
Candaules…you're laughing at me.
How?  How can you see anything?
Because I'm a nurse.
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
Sikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.
No!
I love you.

Is something funny?
What do I do?
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
Yes.  Later.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
I mean home.  India.
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
Only we have to go to work.
This is making me incredibly angry.
How awful.  What will you do?
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
What's he saying?
What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.
This was your garden?
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
Through a window.
How close?
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
Well, no...but...
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
You can't.
Possibly.
You what--?
We're only going one way.
<u>I'm</u> dressed.
Good morning.
Precisely. You give me the Mask security code, I steal the Mask, you get a finders fee. At ten percent, should be two or three million at least. Not too bad.
No. It's a down payment.
The lipstick thermal camera?
Yes, you can.  You can spoil a perfectly nice dance.
Shut up.
The big job.
I told you. It's the down payment. And thanks to you it's overdue.
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
My job, my rules.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
You've thought of everything.
We're doing it tonight.
Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
Charged.
What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
They drive so recklessly there.
We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!!
We can't help it, we...we've gotta...
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
It's never big enough.
How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
Erin, you've been here three weeks.  If you don't know how to do your job by now, I am not about to do it for you.
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
It's those files you asked for.
Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.
So you say.
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.
It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
Yeah.  I know.
<u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.
Out to lunch with the girls.
Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense.
So you think we got 'em scared?
And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
Because I said no.  Look -- the only reason PG&E's even talking to us is cause this is a quiet little real estate dispute.  We add plaintiffs, and suddenly we're in the middle of a toxic tort -- with a statute problem -- against a massive utility.  No, thank you.
-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?
It didn't help, but no.  The real problem's on the bottom.
Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
I would now.
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine.
Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
"Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
Fuck Kurt.
Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too.
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
The firm took in sixty.  That's three percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
Corey.
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
I guess I did.
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
Hey, just so long as you see Him.
You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.
Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
Fixing a leak under your sink.
What?  But you been working so hard --
You are someone.
Nothing.
What's going on?
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
Well, this old neighbor of mine, Bob Linwood -- he ran the dairy on Community -- seemed like someone in his family always had a rash somewhere or other.  I just figured it was something in the genes.  And you know how it is -- you don't like to ask about things like that ...
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
Well, from what this stuff says, I'd say they both have some form of cancer.
Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC.
The Emperor?
We've discussed this before.
This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
Barks and growls at his boss.
Not now, Chewie.  Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?
What happened?
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
Then I'll see you in Hell.
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
He will join us or die, My Master.
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
I'm going to see what it is.
Does Luke know?
I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
What is it?
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
That depends.  Where are we?
A mining colony.
Who's staring?
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
Hyperdrive.
I'm sorry too.
You may call me Leia.
This is no time to be choosy, honey.  What do you say we debate this later?  There's still a chance I can get you out of here.
Luke needs help.  We must go back.
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
You are reckless!
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
It is the future you see.
The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
I tried...
I thought he was, but he came back.
You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
Don't lie to me.
I got a new deal for you.
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
You don't understand. It's already in you.
Call me Snake.
Good.
Lock fuel rods.
It's history. I gotta go.
Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button.
Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President's daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings.
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...
I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that way.
Who?
How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
The freeway.
It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep.
Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
--It is the old wound, that has been opened. I have always known it would be the gateway to my death, for it has never healed. Let my heart do its job, my King, and pump me empty...
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
...Gawain and Perceval, Bors and Bohort, Caradoc and Ector, and all the others--lost to me. Only the echo of their voices remains in this empty hall. All I have left is the memory of their fellowship. Echoes and memories. I am a ghost of the King that once was...  ...Mordred is real, alive, my own flesh and blood. I will see him, I must.
I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
Your mother told you that?
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
And you cannot love me...
Love demands it.
He has given up.
We are to blame.
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.
I am the desert, where water disappears--
--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
Of course I didn't.
Oh, I see.
What's her name?
Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
Yes, I go now.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
What man?
Lies?
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
Yeah well, it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed, and needs an exorcist.
To begin with it could make things worse.
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
The closet
Yeah.
No you don't. I do it all the time.
Oh I bet he is.
Your not gonna marry him are you?
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
Oh, honey.
Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!
Hi Father.
Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
Sure.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
Who are you?
Momma I can take you somewhere to a place where you wouldn't be alone. There'd be people around, you know you won't have to sit here listening to the radio.
And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.
The Lord be with you.
And let my cry come unto thee.
And also with you.
Defender of the human race...
Her heart.
She'll go into coma.
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
Really?
No I probably wouldn't.
I've seen it.
How old are you?
If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?
Why not?
You're not going to drive!
It's our goddamn car!
Give me the keys.
Take it now.
I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool.
You bring trunks, Jack?
Frank.
Accident?
The fire.  The way we're going we'll be lucky to buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym.
When they coming in?
Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack.
How we doing?
What's the point?
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Frank.
Jack...
Fuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him.
You got weird kids, Frank.
No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
You'll see.
What're you talking about?
No.
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.
You recognized me.
So what do you think?
Very realistic.
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
Right.  I love you, Frank.
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
They stopped serving two hours ago.
Two hours ago!
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
How come I didn't hear anything?
Maybe so.  You ever go back there?  Where it happened.
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
Better give her pneumonia.
You don't know?
Seventy-one
Oh, yeah, right.  I forgot.
All right.
It's one of Jack's favorites.
Uh ... we'll let you know.
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
What I mean is --
What's he talking about?
Maybe.  I'll call him.
So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
Someone needs to grow up.  I won't take it, Jack.
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night.  Frank, I can't sing that fucking song anymore!
Is that important?
Gotta go.
His kid's sick.
Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
Better than that.
You were good.
You sending me home?
So, what happened?
Coffee?
You don't pick your brother.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
Eddie did.
Is that what you used to do?
What are they?
Oh?
I guess it's getting serious.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
Wow.
He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.
Not so good.
They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
... Thanks.
Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
A few blanks?  Like what?
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows.  Bro, what you built was a work of art. That little fucker belongs in the Smithsonian.
Either way, come Saturday morning -- I'm pulling you the hell out of there.
It can't be.  It's impossible.
Or what?  You'll have me fired?
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
As much as ever.  Nothing.
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ...
Back then -- who wasn't?
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? They’re all panicked here...
A broker? Really. And now you’re in the tire business?
What’s going on here?
So what are we gonna do, Jack?
Where’s my real dad?
I think I could figure it out.
Big Ed’s.
Mom liked it.
It’s not Kate, is it?
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
She is relentless.
Look, maybe I’m not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtation’s harmless but you’re playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
I’ve got all the time in the world...
No.
Everyone needs something.
What?!
C’mon, Jack...
Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.
Get out, I call 911.
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
It would help me if we were.
Mr. Mintz?  I don’t think so...building’s closed pal.  You’ll have to come back tomorrow.
Yeah...fine.
Telling my mother she doesn’t have to stay with the kids.
She got those shoes...
Really.
I can’t believe it’s not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I could’ve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
Maybe you’re not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldn’t need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if that’s what it’s gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids’ college fund.
Surprise.  We’re pregnant...  Yeah...that must’ve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didn’t we?
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what would’ve happened if you hadn’t stepped in at the store.
If you want to look at it that way...
Nice, Jack.  You’re sweeping me off my feet.
That’s a big one for me, too.
What are you sure about?
Look, you’re making this into something it’s not. This isn’t a referendum on our lives, Kate. It’s a step forward...  Don’t you see?  I’m talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, I’ll be fine...
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, let’s get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
A shelter?!  I’m the richest guy in the building...I’ve got twice the square footage you have!
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
I need you, tiger..
You’re a little tougher, Peter.
That’s easy. You’ve seen my car.
Okay, I’ll take them...
No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty...
Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.
Victor's better at these things.
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
'Course not.  Strictly business.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
<u>What</u> did he do to the uniform?!
I wish I could tell you.  I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here.  I'll notify the CDC and --
You've been working out.
...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --
So are you!
You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
You gave us <u>names</u>?  What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
Showtime.
Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
I know that. But what's the maximum?
Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
Come along, they'll be operating shortly.  See you later, Mike.
They have...  But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
We must!
Thank you for volunteering.
Dr. Michaels is right. We have no choice.
We're pushing oxygen today.
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
You may learn to like it.
You can't --it's too dangerous --
No, it requires such absolute precision --
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
That's not the purpose of this mission.  Captain -- keep a straight course -- until you're in the clear.
Nothing -- against all that force.
Maybe we can...  Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub?
It I can clear this Central Nerve, that <may> be enough...
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.
If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?
Well, we better get on with it.
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
I can't tell you.
And she said it was indelible...
Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.
It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.
Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
That's my license and registration. I wanna be in compliance.
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
Whoa, Daddy.
Yeah.
We split that.
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
Oh, geez.
That's right. And we need more money.
We need more -
Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!
IS IT, JERRY?  You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask 'em!
End a April.
Oh, yah, I know that!
Oh, now he's adorable.
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
Yah?
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
Uh-huh.
Oh, man!
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
I'm sorry, sir, I -
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
Yah!
I mean a parking lot.
What's goin' on there?
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
The heck d'ya mean?
No, see -
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?
I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
Oh...
Oh, yah?
I thought, geez, is that Margie Olmstead? I can't believe it!
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -
I'm sorry.
I was so... I been so... and then I saw you on TV, and I remembered, ya know... I always liked you...
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
Copy.
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.
Love ya, Margie.
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
He's at -
Where's Tyler?
The first rule of Project --
Right, right.
There's no one else here.
We're still men.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
Does this sound strange to you?
It means it was homemade.
Who do you think could've done this?
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
A year?  How'd you manage that?
Please.  Can't we do something... ?
Deal.
Goodbye.
Uh ... nah.
Guy or girl?
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
He's not here.
Is that what you're calling it?
What is wrong with you?
What... ?
I've done you enough favors.
I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
Marla...
I can't let myself see where you're going.  Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities...
You're a tourist.  I saw you at melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular cancer.
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
Somehow, I realize all of this -- the gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is really about Marla Singer.
Oxygen gets you high.  In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths...
Thank you.
There's always that.
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
I don't... think so.
Don't I?
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
No, I...
You get the idea.
This is crazy.
But a good strange.
The fight.
Anyone.
A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.
I don't know how Tyler found the house, but he'd been there for half a year.
"I get cancer, and I kill Joe."
Show-off.
I'm fine.
Listen... do me a favor... sit here a minute...
I don't know...
Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.
Fucking sweet.
You know what I mean.
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
I don't think that's true.
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
"Training?"  Tyler...
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
What about Marla?
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
Not an option, for the most obvious of reasons.  You need to get with the program.  Seven minutes.  Let's get out of here.
Please...
Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. 
Look at me...
Maintenance.
I... I don't know...
Exact order?  Then I'm next!  I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
That's what Alex used to ask himself right up until...
How can you say that?  What kind of monster are you?
So let's do it.
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
Speed up.
I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
Taken care of.
If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...
What about the rest of you?  Kimberly, you were driving to Daytona.  Was Route 18 your first choice?
Carter.
What about you, Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight-?
Yeah, you should have specified.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
But why single me out?  What am I in the great scheme of things?  You'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something... Fucking weird, man.
There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
You're not listening to me!  You have to do something!
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
Clean up?  I don't...
I wasn't worried about us.
Hey, Dad.  What's up?
I don't know what I'd do if I lost you.
Yeah?
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
Most kids never have it happen.
We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.
No! No! Don't!
I wish you were on the plane!
Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
Not with us in the fuckin' car!
That's right, buddy.
Ninety.
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.
Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
Alright.  Home run.
Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?
What... whattaya do?
Hold your pantyhose.  Here, gimme a hand.
Forget it.
Why'd they want us?
You think you are... .
Typical...
He... took it.
That's a crock.  We don't say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public?  The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom.  Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back.  That's billion, Colonel.  With a "B".  For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  A pain in the ass to everybody?  No way. There's no way.
Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.
I could a couple of days ago.  Gonna be... stiff.
Colonel.
Hard to believe.  You shoot up one little town in Oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun... one little dogpatch town... and everybody figures your wrapper's broken.  No sense of humor.  What did you expect?  An engraved plague from the chamber of commerce?
Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.
That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
I never really...went through a... dating period.
Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
<u>Oh my God</u>... <u>What did they do</u>!  <u>My</u> <u>God</u>!!!
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
...<u>Forget it</u>... <u>Goodbye</u>!
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
See, I told you!
Well, what the hell does that mean?
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
Okay... I know but... I met this beautiful girl...
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
Yeah, Edwin, <u>sure</u>... and <u>Pinnochio</u> is a true story... <u>Edwin!  Wake up!</u> This is a fairytale...
Tragedy?
He and his wife was were at some bar ..and some nut came in with a shotgun and blew the place apart. She was a beautiful girl...She never knew what hit her.
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
Yes... I... I agree...
Fine.
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
No, I have to work.
Parry.
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
Well, maybe he wants to stay here.  Do...do you want to stay here?
Happily married, probably.
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Sure...
Oh...like Moses.
Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.
Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
Divorced.
You have a disease.
It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
Well, lemme play the other side then.
Well, lemme sing the one I picked an' see what you think...  "When there's a fire in your heart/Break the glass/Sound the alarm..."
Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
I hope they do.
I'm going on over there...
I'm sorry.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
You got any change?
You're lucky no one was hurt.
Five'll do it.
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
Would you tell her Bobby's here?
You know who it once belonged to?
Don't tell me about this...
Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I?
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
What?
My turn.
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
And you no longer play at all?
Why?
What would I do with it? Run amok?
I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
Of course I do. It's music. You know...
Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...
I'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks. And as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day after tomorrow, and I am, unfortunately, seeing you... Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a bath.
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
Yes.
What?
What?! I can't hear you!
That'll make you happy.
I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry.
What?
Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
Don't call me "honey," mack.
I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
Oh, for pity's sake...
Not now, I'm busy
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
Is it true?
I'm wit' Carlos.
I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
Yo, can I talk to you for a minute?
She fucks it all up!
What you want with her anyway'
You sure?
Your friend must be misinformed.
By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
You mean her.
Sonofabitch.
I have no idea.
Not luck. They don't want me.
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
Full name.
Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights.
Ask anybody.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Just relax.
Fletch...
Affirmative.
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
Right. Fine.
Where am I?
It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
I guess not.
I'd have been long gone.
Harry S. Truman?
Right.
Velma.
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
I know. I got bad luck or something.
What?
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow and arrow. Strange.
I want you to murder me.
I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
That's right.
Shoot.
No problem, boss.
'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
I bet you do.
None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
I ordered lunch.
Yes.
Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
Yeah.
That's what I want to know.
You saw a forgery.
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
Very good sir.
Don Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's.
Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God.  I hope.
You're onto something. That's good. What?
All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.
Who? Donnie and Marie?
Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship.
Forget it.
But I ain't got you...
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy.  Can't we bring up the bass.
Right away!
Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
Then I guess her case is closed. Mine isn't.  I want to know why everybody wants Zuzu.  Why people are killing and dying for her.
Come again?  B.FL.D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U.C.L.A.
You didn't ask.  Have you ever thought about mousse?
Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
No, wait...
Ye-ah.
I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!  Get that stick out of your mouth.  These things are killers, man.  Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...
Did he just say what I think he said?
I don't need it that bad.
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
Yeah, go on...
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
'Booty Time.'
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
That's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of Spam like you.  You look at this picture and all you see is beauty.  I see the beast.
I'm off it!
<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...
Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.
I hope you solve the case and I know you will, because you're the best.  Ford, guys like you don't grow on trees.
Mr. Doyle.
There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
B.O.C.A.
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
Where do you want it?
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
Yeah?
Fuck you, Santa Claus!
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
Sois gentil avec lui.  On ne sait jamais.  Il peut te faire travailler à la télévision.
What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.
S'right.
Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
Des Moines.
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
Willie Mays.
When ya go back on?
Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off and I'll knock you into the middle of next week.
How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?
He coulda been white.
Not a chance.
He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.
This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.
Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.
I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
Whatta you got?
Whyn't you get it dry cleaned and burned.
Just for mistakes of parking?
It was a crematorium.
Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.
What are you saying?
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
I'll go find Hayes.
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
The game, Graham.  The Series?
Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
I seem nervous, huh?
Elvis has left the building.
Nothing.  I just wanted to see you.
You give him his drops?
Hello, Frank.
I think you know, Frank.
Do you know where I found this?
Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
Are you listening to me?  You're in a world of shit.  An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment.  We got your prints all over the place.  Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank.  You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe.
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
Frank, this is insane...
Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
What'd you say your name was?
W...B...2...YXB.
You just burned the desk.
Johnny...?
I'm thirty-five years old.
Fire.
October 12, 1969.
Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.
They'll question her.  Whatever they tell her could change what happens.  No, I want you to follow her.  See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  When they do, you call the cops.
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
Wow.
You all right?
What?
Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder.  John...
Go in where?
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
Nothing you're willing to do.
I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
Nah, just working the job.
I hear that.
Talk about dumb luck.  Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it.  Bets part is she's the first victim.  She knew the doer.  I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
I found this today.  There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe "he" wanted me to have this...
Not now.  I'm cold.
You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.
I love you, man!
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
It's Friday the 13th.
Your bed.
Have you ever made love in a hammock?
Hello.  How are you?
I don't know.
What?
Somebody was in here.
I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
Stick around and you'll see.
Yes.
Keep looking.
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
Whaddya mean?
Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
My ass.
Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
No, he was real.  Like on TV.
We'll scare 'em right back.
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
I think somebody's messin' around out there.
Please, Sheriff.  You'll see we dug it up.
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
Twenty.
Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
That's it, we're done.
'Night, Josh.
That's what I'd like to know.
For a good reason.
You think you can lock me up in this piss-ass prison?  Hell, this place is motel fuckin' six to me.
Her name's Stephanie.
Randy, c'mon!
Are you crazy?!
Don't do anything stupid.
-- Bad?!
Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out for six months after that!  They raised enough money to build a day care center.
Jason...Voorhees?
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
He bought you that?
Ask me in about five minutes.
Nothing.
Right.
No.
Oh dear God...
Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
Am I? Let's find out.
You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing?
I...I can't...
It's not that simple.
Hi, Sean.
I want to go home. I want off this ship.
What about you?
I'm not!!
Big mess every time.
Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
Shut up, Elliot.
Press a button and they give us money.
She wants a divorce.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
What happened eighteen months ago?
Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
What about the haircut?
Keep going west. Last building before the river.
Paisley Porter.
What do you mean?
She was very evasive.
This could be it.
Does what feel comfortable?
This could be it.
I hear Alan's sick.
I talked to her two days ago.
Our Peter?
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
About what?
What?
We're able to surprise each other.
Do you want to get some coffee?
I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
I have a class. I'm late.
Brilliantly moving.
What's sexy?
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
It's your best play, Nicky.
He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.
It violates so many trusts.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
I don't know if I can say that.
Washed away.
A thousand things.
This could be it!
Life is real.
It's me. Nicky.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
Show him who we are.
A grandmother. God bless you.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
Life is good.
Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
Why?
Yes.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
What?
Is what true?
Someone waiting for you?
I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.
One more.
Going nearer to God!
No -- neither do I. But...  but this man is a Christian and he has written --
I've never spoken for anything else.
That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world.
That's when you take advantage.
Ahh.
God, even <i>you</i> want to tell me what I <i>can't</i> do. In case you hadn't noticed, Anton, I don't need rescuing.  But <i>you</i> did, once.
Now is your chance to find out.
This is a murder investigation.  The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets.
It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
This time I will supervise each test personally.
Jerome--?
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
You had to be a right-hander.
Keep going!!  Keep going!!
They found my eyelash.
Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
Again?
It happened in Australasia.  He checked in yesterday.  No family complications, no record he ever broke his neck.  As far as anybody's concerned, he's still a walking, talking, fully-productive member of society. You just have to get him off the pipe and fill in the last two years of his life.  Excuse me, <i>your</i> life.
There's a way.
It was a mercy-killing after all.
Let's walk.
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
No, you don't understand.  I <i>can't</i>.
That's right.
That's your problem.
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
I want to take a walk.
Good.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
Really.
He might be ready to chop us up.
Do it my way.
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
If you don't start telling the truth... 
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
You bastard...
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
Let's do it.
I guess you're right.
You want to try with me?
Things can't get much worse can they?
You and me.
If they are not here, he must have sent them away.
I guess we are.
We walk.
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
You were with him?
Whatever you need.
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
He took the day off.
Can't leave the desk.
Just fine.
Why not?
Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.
You got it.
A Ford... We have a Ford.
That's good. That's very good. Now Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. One more thing... If anybody but you comes back...
I know. I know.
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
This is my brother's car.
Oh ay?
Yeah.
Well, he drove it into the river.
How'd it happen, then?
Never mind.
Christ, what...
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
He's got a new place at Burnham.
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
Nicer than most.
Once a week?
It's the truth.
You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
He was here for four days.
To the demon king's castle, of course.
Nasty.
Yeah.
And you didn't know her last name?
No.
Nice of you to come.
Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
No.
Thanks.
It just would. He was always the same.
Las Vegas.
Will this do?
No. Really, I am.
Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
Don't ask me.
You wouldn't.
Didn't you know this is my home town?
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
Yeah,  Come off it, Eric. Who is it?
Can't say I do.
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
Nasty way to go.
Yes.
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
It's too...
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
No.
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
That's the truth...
You...
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
What do you mean?
Yes...?
Huh.
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
What did you say?
Did you talk to Graff?
Is that what I said?
However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.
You're saying "me."
What?
No.
...and rob the place...
Absolutely.
That's ridiculous.
Well, they're old.  I saw the shit that they were giving you.
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
They stole...
They stole the...
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
...what am I going to do all month...
Yeah.
Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
Where were you?
Did they catch...?
Do you understand?  My stuff is mine, his stuff is ours.  I'm taking half of his commissions-- now, you work it out.
No.
Fuck.  I had them on River Glen.
We had a robbery. 
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
I don't want to go to lunch.
Would you excuse us, please...?
What about the other two?
...after the thirtieth...
You know what those leads cost?
John.  John...
I'll tell you why I'm out.  I'm out, you're giving me toilet paper. John. 
Twenty percent.
I'm not sure I have two.
Alright.
No.
I can't split them.
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
It's not impossible.
Mmm.
How do you know I made it up?
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
He told me my share was twenty-five.
No, I don't think so, Shel.
Hey, I don't want to hear your fucking war stories...
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
"Bruce, Harriet...Fuck me, believe in yourself..."
Shit.
They...
"You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
Yes.
Uh...
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
What do I...?
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
I'm not.
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
Tuesday.
Tell me again.
No, Jim.
I...
What, "this"?
What are the police doing here...?
When...
Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
Why not?
"Fuck the Machine"? "Fuck the Machine"?  What is this.  Courtesy class...?  You're fucked, Rick--are you fucking nuts?  You're hot, so you think you're the ruler of this place...?!  You want to...
What is this, your farewell speech?
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
What can we do?
 Then, after that, what?  Joe 'Little Knife' Pisani; Willie Bufalino, maybe, Mr. Maranzalla himself, c'mon!
Then why do you come to me?
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Tom is right.
I hated you for so long, Michael; for so many years.  I think I did things to myself, to hurt myself, so that you would know -- and you would be hurt too.  But I understand you now; I think I do.  You were being strong for all of us, like Papa was.  And I forgive you, and want to be close to you now.  Can't you forgive Fredo; he's so sweet, and helpless without you.
Yeah, but I don't want him to see you.
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
 My two friends have my share of the money.  I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
You know otherwise, Freddie?
But, you told me yourself...
The old man will never bring in the New Year.
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
Why?
Chi?
Within the compound will be fine.
How long does this go on?
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
I don't know.
Connie's outside.
But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
No, I have confidence in their loyalty... but this is life and death, and Tom, you are my brother.
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
Wait... there's something else.
Mike, at three and a half...
Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
I want it met.
They are everywhere!
Good.  Then you're staying.
I'm staying.  Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that.  Now, explain everything to me.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
Very well.
Is he related to the witness?
Whose orders are these?
I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
Why don't you sit down?
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
Get out of my hotel.
We do favors for each other...
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
Jake, Jake, come over here.  Mike, I want you to meet Jake Cohen; he manages the casino for us.
So?
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
After dinner.
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
Trust me; do as I ask.
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
Some water.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
Eh...  Five dollars more.
In fact, reduced, bu five dollars!
Why is everybody giving me crap tonight?
What's to be jealous of?
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
You did not know?
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life.
We have his note.
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
I stink to high heaven right now.
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
What did she mean by going flooey?
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
No.  I'm fine.
What?
Go ahead.
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
Or a husband.  Depending on which of us you asked.  My friend David. He lived here for many years.
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
But we have to match the other sketch.
Why not?
I like that.  But take care, Mr. Boone.  Freedom is a drug, much like any other.  Too much can be a very bad thing.
You were a soldier?
You're the one who started it.
I want -- I want...
Exactly.  Cukor was too cheap to hire music.  There's nothing but chin-wag.  The cold dreary custard of English chin-wag.
Monsters?  The only monsters...  ...are here.
Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
All right.
Good.  Fine.
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?
In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
So what do I do?
Everything.  Start at the beginning.
I don't mind.
I just need to -- lie down. Studio.  Daybed in studio.
Don't go away.
Sit?
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
Six years ...
We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
My version of "take this job and shove it..."
Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
You got no choice. It's over.
You spend enough time down a man's throat, you get to know his tonsils. Do it ...
You know my back -
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
You know my back.
No...
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
You know my back.
Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...
You, too, Ma...
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
He's in some trouble ...
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
You remember that, Kip?
NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.
You've been pre-booked...
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
Damn crooks is everywhere --
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
About what?
You?
Shadow games ...
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
Where'd you find this one?
Yeah. He's knows of one all right.
So I was replaced by Mitch?
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
No way ...
No. Open her ...
I know. But let's prep 'em. We could stay here all night... That wouldn't be good --
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
No. No. The guy from downtown.
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
Son of a bitch.
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
Who's gonna do that?
Oh no! No!  Noooo!
I got scared.
Have a drink first.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
Yeah.
Marty, please. Let me talk to him.
Tommy.  Come on. Relax.
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
Please?
Least I work for a livin'.  Why'd you get fired?
--or a tail--
No, and we got four of 'em.
Gone.
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
Why didn't you yoke him?
Ah, history I think.
Oh...
Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY
How much money you got?
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
Oh, Morgan.
Seven.
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
Which one's your building?
Hey fuck you.
Well... I'll be speaking to your supervisor.
That's right.
An integer.
Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
I told you to cooperate with these people.
It's right.  Take it home with you.
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving.
Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He says you start working for them next week.
I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
Is there someplace we can talk?
I've been busy.
Since Nancy died.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
Why me?
That would be fine.
I'll be okay.
It's a poker game with this young man. Don't let him see what you've got.
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
Never been.
Who is he?
Let's hit "Kelly's."
So what do you got, a fuckin' Hyundai engine under there? Can I make it back to my house?
Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
Will, your not getting off that easy.
Have you read all these books, Will?
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
That must have taken you a long time.
You think so?
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
No.
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
What does?
I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
No.
Why not?
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
Don't give me you line of shit.
Look at me. What do you want to do?
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
I know.
It's not your fault.
That's what you want?
Good for you. Congratulations.
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
What, five?
Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
All the time. We all live in Southie. I live with three of them now.
How the hell did you do that?
When?
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
I'd say...  It's only four in the mornin', they're prob'ly up.
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
Just for fun?
--When it came to stuff like that I could always just play.
I know. I just do.
What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
Yes, I do, Will.
Joe!
Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
Well, you ain't a-goin'! Ain't *nobody* else a-goin'! We *got* here an' we gonna *stay* here, together! As long as we got the fambly unbroke I ain't scared, but it's a long bitter road we got ahead of us--  --an' I'm here to tell ya ef anybody else tries to bust us up anymore I'm a-goin' cat wild with this here piece a bar-arn!
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Naw. They paroled me.
I didn't see nothin'.
Two.
Joad. Tom Joad.
How many of you?
Why, you're the preacher!
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
What you figger to do?
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
Hide in the willows. If it's awright to come back I'll give you four high whistles.
Casy! What you doin' here?
Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
You ain't got to get sore.
Yeah.
And I ain't gonna listen either. I tol' you what I'm gonna do.  And I don't give a hoot in a hollow if they's oranges and grapes crowdin' a fella outa bed even, I ain't a- goin' to California!  This here's my country. I b'long *here*.  It ain't no good--  --but it's mine.
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
I can't he'p it, Ma. It don't make *me* giggly an' happy.
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
Pa! Shh!
How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?
I'm ready.
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.
Forget it, Ma. Jus' think about the nice things out there. Think about them grapes and oranges--an' ever'body got work--
Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
Granma's dead.
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
You know, I jus' can't remember when I felt so good before!
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
I don't understan' it, Tom.
They come. They come and pushed me off.
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
Well, I'm right here to tell you, mister, ain't *nobody* going to push me off *my* land! Grampa took up this land seventy years ago. My pa was born here. We was *all* born on it, and some of us got killed on it, and some died on it. And that's what makes it ourn--bein' born on it, and workin' it, and dyin' on it--and not no piece of paper with writin' on it! So just come on and try to push me off!
Why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when I went up.
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce.
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
I sell BMW's. What do you do?
You could've been a contender, huh?
What do you want to do?
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
Correct.  That's for you. Keep it.
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
Okay... Hold on...
--She's not dead---
Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
It's something I do...
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.
What stuff?
Out Loud?
Do you like the people you work with?
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
Thank you, no.
Hard to get good help these days.
Excellent. Here they come.
--Yes. And the Munich Olympics in '72. A local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened.
He using her.
Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
No, I don't have one.
How did you get this job?
Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?
Look! Please! Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again!  I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
Well, that'll be a little complicated --
You can make it as complicated or as easy as you like. But she's the one who's gonna be riding him, am I right? So here's the deal. I'm not sure I can do anything, but I'm prepared to give it a go --  -- if you'll help.  You have a problem with that?
You ever just stand still for a minute?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
I thought you lived in Chicago?
Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
OK.
It is. It's lovely.
How did you find out all that?
Just make yourself comfortable.
I am comfortable.
Huh?
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
Okay.
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
What about him?
Maybe they should put me down too.
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
Fine!
Fine.
You were never thirteen, Mom.
Did he tell you that?
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
You already did.
If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
LEAVE ME ALONE!!
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Why should they?
Hi.
Go ahead...
Yes. We're suing.
David, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying I faked the figures. You're not going soft on me, are you?
Exactly...
Riding with Judith.
It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him...  ... Whether or not we were...  ... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch.
Sing it to me, Frankie!
All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
Night.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
No. I am a "tubab."
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
No. He had the choice.
No imposition. Plenty of food. Gonna get pretty dark soon. Hard to find a place.
No reason you should, no reason you should.
Frank's a good man.
Sounds like something Tom would say.
Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list.
Oh God, Annie, I'm so sorry. I... I know you're being hit with a low now, I don't want to take too much of your time but I have to talk to you about Pilgrim.
I understand, but Annie, please...
I believe women from New York eat mixed salads. Ain't that right, Tom?
That's what some folks say.
Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
I don't know if I can with my leg.
Not a question of if you can -- you are. Just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself.
Sure.
So?
How's Pilgrim doing?
How much longer do you think?
I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck.
The number's by the phone.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
It's not cool. It's commie bullshit!
Alright sir.
The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
Was that her top?
Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
Again?  Yeah sure.
That's far out!
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
Difficulty rating?
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run.  I mean... Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look...  "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers!
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
Yeah, mom?
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
Give it up! Just give it up.
What's this one eat?
Think you can do better?
I'll give it a shot.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
Name your stakes.
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
Love, secret, and uh, sex.  But not in that order, necessarily, right?
You think they're going to bust us?
Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
Pervert! What are you talking about?
All right.
Not without Jamie.
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
How do you know their not?
Outside.
Yeah.  Well I guess your happy to see him go.
Drive Carefully.
I can't sleep.
It's Halloween. I mean don't you want to get dresses up in a really scary costume and get some candy?
It was the nightmare man
I thought you said you were ready.
No.
Oh no you can't. I've just been there. That's the first place he'll look for you. Where's the school house? Where is the school house?
Why?
Just do it.
All right. Good Good.  Logan I want you right here by the front door. This is the dead bolt key.
All right.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.
No problem, Sheriff.
What are we doing?
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
Dear God.
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
Evil.
You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
Now you understand?
The only things missing were some Halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. What does that sound like to you?
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
Exploring uncharted territory?
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
Annie!
Yes, you can.
No, he's not.
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
Yeah.
Are you sure?
Will you call me tomorrow?
Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block.
TOTALLY!
Well, she's totally not here.
Same time, same place.
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
I don't like that story.
Laurie, what's the Boogey Man?
What about the rest of my comic books?
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe.
There WAS.
I promise.
I saw him...
Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
If you say so.
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
I can't believe it!
Well, let's do it.
Look at this.
A lot of works.
Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
Hmm?
And maybe my lawyer.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Is this your first job?
What makes you think we're more interesting?
And it's just in one ear?
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Well, are...are they big?
How's Frederick?  He didn't come.
Ohhhh!
I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?
No!  No...
Uh, yes!
Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
Oh, my God.
I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
It's so late.
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
No!
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
You're not lost.
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
How do you know?
Mmm, what am I gonna do with you? 
Mmm...
I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
What are you going to use for money?!
No.
I'm saying it now!
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
Like-- 
I can't keep my mind on the show.
Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
No.
Really?
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
Yeah.  I'll get some ice.
I know, I know.
Go out, go out by the Sung vase and, and catch this.
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
You promised to stay on the wagon.
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
True.
No, no, we decided!
Here.  Be careful with those.
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
Oooo.
How?
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
Oh, so loosely.
Well--
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy!  The room's alive with positive vibrations!
No!
My--uh...
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
I was so bored!
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
God!
Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
Well...
Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
Probably not.
No, well...I've been trying to write.
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
No, the reason I ask is--
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I--
So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
Oh, well.
I should have kept going.  I-I have a sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation I should've kept walking and...
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
Y-you used to-- Oh, no!  Yeah, I care.  You used to be so ambitious and...  God, you really liked it?!
Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago...
...which I did not get.
You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating. 
Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
...<u>please</u>...
...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
It wasn't my day.
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
You want me to be?
Rich, comic book freaks.
And why is it a vacant exercise?
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
Impossible.
Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. 
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
Starling...?
 He once made me an improper suggestion.
Am I on that case, sir...? 
Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
Reinstatement to <u>what</u>?  There ain't nobody there...
And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
You nervous...?
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
How's your <u>child</u>?
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?

It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
With Mama and Shirley and Stringbean.
Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat.  You have to go away.
You were given backup....
I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
Thanks to <u>you</u>...
...and my need for The Institution...
...but will that satisfy you?
Explain in depth the plan we have for him.  Until tomorrow.
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
Well.  <u>Excellent</u>... I'm...
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
Because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
...get me a cigarette.
Thank you.
...what a lovely perfume.
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
Brazilian. 
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
I can be a good pig. Babe. Charlotte's Web. Good pig. Watch.
Stop it, stop it, you satanic whore!
That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
Yeah, his lack of intelligence. Sorry, Wendy, but as learning disabilities go, stupidity is often overlooked.
I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
You and Wichita go to school together, right?  Have you two ever...
When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?

You know, this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing...
I love you. Don't say I love you, too. I hate that--"love you, too."
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
Do you really think I care?
This isn't about "doing it." I just think we need to talk some things out privately before...
Thank you, my love.                                         ]
That's okay. Your Mom said you had a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date.
Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day.
That's bullshit. Just shoot.
Uh-huh.
Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
Don't worry. I'll ask you to do me a favor. You'll get the negatives and everything back then.
You're not funny. Ouch!
Jealous much?
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
Maybe it's time for a vacation.
Killing her won't solve anything.
Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
Like a suicide thing?
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.
I think I know Heather a bit better than you, okay? If she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be absolutely spotless.
You didn't say Simon Says.
I thought I...you..
Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?
This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.
But my name's not...
I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.
Look who I've found!
Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?

Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
That idiot boarder?
That's great! We'll have the fare in no time!
Mummy!
I did more then that.
Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes.
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
Oh I see. That again. Trevor? I realize it must be hard. But Christ how long does it take someone to move on?
If what I've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time. Besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one. Clock's ticking. Tick-tock...
Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy.
What?
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
We're just gonna take some blood here.
Use your mind for something other than numbers dear Trevor. Think about people for a change. People other than yourself. Like the women you slept with behind your wife's back. You were always so confident you had covered your tracks. Always confident your wife actually believed your fervent denials? Part of you must have known she would find out.
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
I know a guy who only has one leg.
Hey, do I look crazy?  I don't go for that shit... interviews, media. They're manipulators.  "Keep a low profile," that's my motto.
The bathroom!  For two days?
Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
So now you gotta wear it, you poor bastard.  Everyday you gotta be everybody's hero.  People watching you all the time.  Waiting for you to make...  a slip.  Slip up.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Mister LaPlante...
Look, I got this kid.  We got a goddamn relationship!  I'm takin' him to a movie tonight!  He worships me.  If I go down what's this do to my son?  I'm his goddamn role model for Christ sake!
Spanish kinda guys!
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
Bill, listen...
Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?
The same thing that always happens! You blew it! And this time you broke your son's heart instead of mine!  He was so proud, looking forward to going to a movie with his father... and you let him down!  Like you let everybody down, always!  What did you do, take a mudbath?
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
Yeah.  I'll see ya... dad.
Goodnight, John.
You do?
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
That too.
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
We paid him a million dollars. You'd think he'd want to cooperate a little, help our ratings.
Listen, Gale, I know you're emotionally involved.  Don't be emotionally involved, be professional.  No, Gale, you are not a hardbitten, cynical hard-ass, you just think you are.  You are a goddamn cream puff!  Try and be a hard-ass!
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
I didn't ask him.
So this really does the trick, eh?
Friend, that animal will go after whoever's approaching the sound of that whistle.  And God help whoever it is.  Because that dog will not let up until there's dead meat on the ground.  Put your faith in that, pal.
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
It's a living.
Uh huh.
I think we should talk first.
Why are you mad at each other?
I've asked him what's wrong.
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."
I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
And it's a shorter commute.
Damn.
Huh?
There's no card or anything.
What next?!  -- A strange bra under my pillow!
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
Yeah -- she did a good job.  This glass looks brand-new.
I am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. <u>You're</u> the final straw on this back, baby!
I'm having the floor fixed,
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
Do you have enough money?
It's a double.
Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.
I don't need proof.  I know it.  Send it out.
That's what I figured.  Well, I have a little home coming present for you.
He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
Maybe he was a lousy shot.
Most people are afraid of death.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
Caution shows wisdom.
Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.
What else?  What else do you hear right now?
And what do you think you will find in another land?
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
No -- I will.
I stood up first.
No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
I remember you.
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
Because it's my name.
Then how did he know your name?
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
Is it?
Yes -- it is.
Conner?
His head.  Someone cut it off.
And this?
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
I do not know -- and even if I did...
It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
It's not for me to decide.
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
I guess so.
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
I took the call from Glen personally. They're still in Smith's house.
You're not goin' anywhere!  Get on the fuckin' floor!
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --
Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here!
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
You've already helped yourself once, Dennis; be smart again.  If you save his life, it'll help when you get to court.
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
I got the gasoline --
I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.
I overheard him with the girl.
I think you got no choice.
Where is it?
You'd better be kidding.
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
No!  I'm not going to leave Daddy with them!
Shh, they'll hear you!
Mars?  What are you doing?
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
I need to talk to him.  Alone.
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up?
Go, Chief.
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a break.  See your family.  If I need you, I'll call.
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
Don't worry about what we used to be.
Special Agent Jones.
Think of me that way and you won't fuck up.  I'll handle the Sheriffs.
They've been in there all day.
Where's the office?
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
Can you get into the office?
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
We, who is we?
I'll be back.
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
And four children?
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them.
Canadian Club?
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
Excuse me, Colonel.
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
Will you protect us.
I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
Watch everything? How? They are gone.
The police are very busy.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
I'll be over.
What do you mean, General?
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
I led no massacres.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
) You cannot kill them all.
They moved you from the Diplomat?
I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
Also, this is your bill for the last week.
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
Get in.
Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them.
So where is the lamb?
Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
What?
Why?
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
I cannot leave these people. I will wait for the twins.
I will follow on the next plane. Go.
There is one thing I need right away.
When?
As the trucks go.
So what stopped her?
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
You sure? You'll be alright by yourself?
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
And we get this money when?
Prove it.
Don't push it.
Why not?
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store --
-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
Everyone that was invited is related to one of the staff who was here when the place burned. There are five of us...
That's crazy!
-- was that??
For chrissake give me a hand!
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
I don't do groups.
How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
Haven't they already?
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
Then who are they?
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
-- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby --
Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
I think it's something better experienced then described.
-- even if I give you a million as well?
Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
Something....happened --
Colleen.
No, I live about in Wexford.  It's about a five hour drive.
Yes.
Where is she now?
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
Ok.
No.
Oh come on!
Know what?
What?
White meat will be fine...
May I come in?
Good night.
The amulet...
Oh.
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
Doc?  ...  Doc ... Hello?
It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
Right.
Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
I'm trying to quit.
Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You think you're going to live forever?
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
And he still sits there?
Buying some drugs, alright?
Here!  Here!  Pull over!
You gonna buy?
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
But how in God's name ...
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
Really?
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
C'mon.  It'll be great.
Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
Something like that.
Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just...
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look at this.
Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting out a fire with kerosene.
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things.
Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I...
You sound disappointed.
Don't worry, we'll get it...
You can be lookout!.....  Take Alex's gun.
I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...
You're a reed, man.  I gotta get Anna.  Hang in there...
Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb...
Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...
Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.
Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A million?
Because I didn't want to get hurt, taterhead.
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!
I killed some lovable working class Italian-diabetic, but you killed the most significant male figure of the decade and a kind, gentle lover.  So don't play with me.
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
I'm supposed to fall for that?
God, I miss communism.  The Red Threat.  People were scared, the Agency was respected, and I got laid every night.
If you do anything to my friend...
I don't think you'll appreciate their choice of weenie.
The Shazzammeter!
Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
Why yes, do you know it?
Well, I --
Well, she probably had a deadline...
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie...
You don't say.
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
Sure, Norville, sure...
Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
Now, Aim --
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
Watch it, Archer --
I got big ideas, though!
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Well, I --
But, buddy, you were --
Nah, that's all forgotten.
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.
Yes sir...
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
I --
Wait a minute!
It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
She's looking for her mark.
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
My brother's wife.
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
I'm sorry...
I've never given it much thought.
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
Technical responsibility, real responsibility -- what difference does it make?  Jessica lives -- or she dies. That's what we're talking about!
Maybe it's better this way, Mother. I'm glad you're going home, Betsy -- you'll be out of the mess.
Emotion tricks all of us, Mrs. Rand.  And you are a woman with a very strong conscience.  That conscience has been tormenting you. The rest is coincidence.  There is no such thing as a Zombie.  The dead do not come back to life. Death is final.
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
Betsy, tell them about the Houmfort.  Tell them what you saw there.
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
You go dry off now.
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot.
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
Fine.
Thanks.
Stay out of trouble.
Yeah?
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
Birth control.
Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.
Nothing.
Jesus all right enough!
What do you think we're doing, dad?
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
But what?
But I -- well maybe I love her. Elena.
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Yes. Well, I guess we can walk from here.
With Mikey?
Nobody.
Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner.
Social work?
Well I of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course I've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples --
They say you never forget.
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
I gotta get to English class.
See ya.
Do what?
Um, Libbets Casey.
Am I right or am I right?
Would it matter?  And what's that?
No!
It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
I dunno. I --
Watching what?
No.
Huh?
Sure.
I had him!
Do it again.
That must have been awful for you.
Five feet?  Seven feet?
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
What happened at that signing?
Even the best make mistakes.
You know what about.
When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
No way.
Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.
Huh?
You don't know.
That's a long time.
Long as it's fun.
Thought you wanted something fun...
Told each other everything.  That why your picture's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau?
She used some stupid code name.
Thought you might find that.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
Congratulations.
Then so was mine...
Ah! You have questions?
No.
Then I leave too.
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
I understand you only too well. You let them do it, as I let Lestat turn a child into a demon. As I let her rip Lestat's heart to pieces! Well I am no longer that passive fool that has spun evil from evil till the web traps the one who made it. Your melancholy spirit of this century! I know what I must do. And i warn you - you saved me tonight, so I return the favour - do not go near your cell in the Theatre Des Vampires again.
I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
Does it?
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
What plans?
Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
Louis, put me in my coffin...
What have you done?
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
He'll never let us go.
The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
Come, Claudia...
No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
What danger?
So you felt it too!
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
You asked for death. I didn't promise it -
The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too.
But how do you know?
But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we...
And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?
I know. Let her alone.
In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.
No...
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
Yes. I remember...
You have it...
Well, what a lucky break for me.
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
Yes.
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
He did it to make you stay with him!
Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...
Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.
Yeah, right -- whatever.
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
I miss Ray...I tried to call him.
Yes.
I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
I'm right here. Grab my hand.
No, you're not.
...Nancy?
It's okay.
What? The Bahamas? You're kidding.
Will you try...for me, please?
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
I told you.
I don't know.
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
Deep breaths --
It's...him.
Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
Are you sure? I really appreciate it.
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
I'll talk real slow.
We gotta get out of here. Now.
Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
How much?
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
What is up with that weirdo?
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
The Greeks thought death was beautiful -- an adventure --a journey to another world.  But I have my other guests to think of -- The General will be wanting to go back to his army. If you'll excuse me --
He's dead. I want the General to see him.
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
Thank you, I'll do that. Good night.
This was once a cemetery.
That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
Poor Cathy --
Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life ——you've ruined mine ——
Didn't you? But now -- what are you thinking now?
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect ——young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
No. I mean your other secret -—	the one you kept bidden even from my father. That old doctor in London -- he told me.
Miss Wollsten -— my secretary, she'd know.
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
Thea?
But that should make you like her.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
I had a notion you had become self—appointed chaperone lately — why?
When you make sense I'll listen.
Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
All I'm asking is thirty days more . . .
I hate to do this, fella.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
What are you, a mind reader or something?
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
Yes, George?
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
Sit down? What are . . .
Well, naturally. Of course.
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission –– I mean –– might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir –– and people are beginning to talk.
You can keep him on. That's all right. As secretary you can hire anyone you like.
All right.
Of course it's the place.
George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
Oh –– Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess we better run along.
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.
I'm all right.
Hmmm . . .
Hmmm . . .
Well then, how do you know?
Aw, get going!
Where's my insurance policy?  Oh, here . . .
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about –– build things . . . design new buildings –– plan modern cities –– all that stuff I was talking about.
Still after that first million before you're thirty.
Did you get a doctor?
Say, where's Mother?
Harry . . . Harry . . .
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
It's important.
Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
That way, huh?
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
When?
The whole town's gone crazy.
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
Well, I don't.
Me?
Well, why don't you say it?
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
About what?
Didn't you tell her?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Thank you.
Thanks for dropping around.
My baby.
Yeah, just started.
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
I don't care. It's George's tux.
Well, I don't know....
Soon, dark eyes, soon.
I'm supposed to.
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
I think we're changing course a little.
I hope that's the cousin.
We better go back in.
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
In here.
That one -- from the wreck.  You brought it up, did you look inside it?
But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
No place special.  Just hanging out.
No backtalk!  I spoke to Upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there.  You can work until school starts.
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
What else you got?
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
All of us thank you, okay?
It means I don't like all that grab-ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who's out to screw me here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there -- and I don't want to go through that horror again.  Ever!
Sound?
I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal?
Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
One what?  Ah-ha!
Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
No.
Do you?
That's great too.  Gorgeous.
Ooohh, nothing.  I just got fired, that's all.
Going out.
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
What?
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
That's you.
I've never been supercargo.
Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
I want you to meet my cousin.
Help!  Help!
Nope.
What's that mean?
I'll be right there.  Wait up.
Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
Coming about, then.
I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in the way?
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
What the hell is he doing?
Go on, you're tired.
It's easy.  Put a net on the derrick.  Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
Shit.
Don't forget you have your brother.
They just wanted to say hello.
Make up your mind.
What's that?
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
We'll go to Palm Springs, Death Valley, Arizona desert, anyplace where there's no water.
Okay.
Sure.  Let's go.
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
So tell Calvin.
... Okay.
I am.  You're not.
Yes, aren't we all.
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
What in hell is that?
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
Get ready to go.
Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it.
I don't know, what else is there?
The one that goes underwater?
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Now what's this do?
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
I am serious.
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
The world's southern most reaches.
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
It's not closing, Mike.
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
That's what grandmas are for.
No way....
Chicken....
We need milk....
Thea was attacked by a shark....
You caught me....
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
You make sure they come?
You have something to say about everything....
I'm hungry, Mom....
A small one...Your brother won't be here....
I won't....
I'd like that.  I need to be away from here.
Thank you....
Good night, Daddy....
What?
I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
It's Jake's actually...Our floating lab....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
You just got here....
I'm fine....
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
Why'd you take the boat?
You're impossible....
The plane's turning....
It's wonderful....
I'm terrific... Come on....
I like to travel....
I'm sorry...I....
You're the man who drives the plane.
You got a better idea...?
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
Will you get the bloody hell out of here....
You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel....
How's Ellen?
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
Will you leave me alone...?
If you'd leave me alone, I'd be able to get my work done....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
Where the hell's the beer...?
It's not a bad life, Jake....
You're afraid of the competition out there....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
As long as he's been here....
How long has he been here...?
What do you know about him?
Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
'A Moray eel....'
I don't like the song.
You jump, you'll kill yourself....
No way....
We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me....
Jake.
Don't flatter yourself.... 
You want to be careful how you talk to me... I'm about to become famous...You should see....
Good night, Polly....
Deputy Brody will take care of it personally.
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
Is it your vehicle?
No, my mother's .. You better stop in .. I'm just here to feed the cat.
Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
Since when did you drink diet soda?
It's a method for quitting smoking.
Because it's a ritual you gotta go through with. I'm down to 10.
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> ..
I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
It's twenty of three.
What d'you mean, "bits."
Have you got a match on the bullet?
I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
We have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere - <u>and a bill</u> <u>for seventeen dollars for its wig</u>!
Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
I'm talking, outside the girl?
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
Hamlet. Have you read it?
There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me.
Pray?
No I'm not.
Why does he want to kill me?
I know about alcohol, John.
Why?
Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
Come on, Michael, outta here, the guys trying to move in. I told you what we know, something else, you- 'll be the first to hear about it ..
No, Sergeant, I got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..
Two or three years ago.
Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
I think I've found a hand.
Ask him.
Ugh!
Okay, this is working.
Still going.
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
Now what did you lose?
My son... my mind...
Oh tsht. Yes.
-- the part about "we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm" --
No no, I know --
I just got goosebumps.
Well, I'm happy for you.
We will be fine!
Mission... statement...
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
Will you marry me?
Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
I don't need you to "stick."
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
What about Ray?
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
No--
It's only a half-hour show, Rod.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --
Call me tomorrow.
Uh, not today, but --
No, I air-dry.
No tell me. _ 84.
You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
Rod, get on the camel.
How do I know?
I'm a little worried --
I'm worried too.  I'm worried that the only reason I'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you weren't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago.
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
What --
Gorgeous.
Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
What DO you stand for???
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
Right up ahead, buddy --
I'm scared.  What is it?
It's in a cage.  Do not be scared of...
I'm not putting him down, I just have a commitment to the truth.
A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
Who's that?
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that’s where he's headed.
What about Eric?
Just hold on.
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
About a thousand feet above it, actually.  Most mountain-climbers remember how tall that mountains were.
I thought you were an expert.
It won't hold!
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
Yeah.
What did you think?
I want to be an astronaut.
No. I couldn't see.
Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute, would you?  They look worried.
No we're not.
This plane can not land!
Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane...
Sure you have. You wrote that book...
How do you mean?
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
Good lad.
I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
You're going too?
I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy.
I don't know.
What's that?
Because it exists.
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
What?!
These formations.  They're dried --
Birdshit?
Oh, no!
It's not worth taking the chance, John.
Damn!
The monitors are failing.
How would we cut off the lysine?
'Bout thirty seconds.
How am I supposed to transport them?
I got an eighteen minute window.  Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.
I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
Why?
They smell.
Sattler.
Say again?
And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.
That's right.  But they never attack the same place twice.  They were testing the fences for weaknesses. Systematically.  They remembered.
Alan!
I'm still not clear on Chaos.
It simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems.  It's only principle is the Butterfly Effect. A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine.
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
In a box under my seat.
Then they're expensive.  Put them back.
Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
A Do-you-think-he-saurus Rex.
Machines hate you?
You're sure?!
Relatively.
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
Dorkatops!
Please!
Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.
Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick!
Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
John, John.
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
Wait a minute?  What do you mean "worked"?  Everything is still off!
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
Ray, start the tour program.
There's no sign of him anywhere.
Why did you do this?
What if we fall?  I hate trees.
That means they only eat vegetables.  But for you, I think they'd make an exception.
You want to put in chain saws?
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
That's not true...
Get rid of them.
Great.
Yeah?
I know... but we left the main trail... and I can't find any landmarks around here... I've been trying to figure it out but...
I really think we should go back...
Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on?
He... he's here...
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.
And we're in the center ring.  You sure you want to wear that blazer?
That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed.
No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.
Doesnit sleep?
You're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. And you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  But it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
That doesn't make sense.
So what do we do?
Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.
Think it'll do any good?
And if he's not?
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
You were his friend.  One link is all they need.
Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
I do.
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
I've never seen you here before.
They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.
Why were you given notice?
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
Usually.
Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
Eight -- and seven months.
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
Ludwig?
Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
I think you're trying to run before you can walk, Ann.
These are priceless artifacts! They're ruining the site!
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
We're leaving.
Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
Jack!...  Jack!
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  "Skull Island"  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
An ape ... some kind of ape.
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
What?
What's compassion, mister.
I do not love him.
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
So do I.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
Why isn't he locked up?
-- We can talk --
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
My name's John Klute.
Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?
Mm.
Mm.
Most of them.
How would I remember?
-- You want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things --
Mm.
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
How?
How can you do it to yourself?
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
I don't like getting splashed.
I was wondering what that was.
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
You wanted to, or you are?
Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
OK.
What?
Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
All right.
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
No.
Thought it might. It's off an arrest report you typed two years ago. Man you wanted samples of everybody.
I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet.
He's in his room, playing.
My daddy doesn't hit me, silly. Why would my daddy hit me?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Show.
On earth.
Wow!  French toast, really?
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
Mom, I mean dad?
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
That's okay...
Good night.
I love you...
Yep.
Yeah, there was apple juice.
No, son, I didn't get fired.  I'll tell you what we'll do, okay?  How about if we go to a Burger King and then we watch a little T.V. and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow. Just you and me...How 'bout that?
Six years.
Objection!
No.
How long was that?
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
I'm not taking him with me.
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
NO!...Please...Please don't make me stay...I swear...If you do, sooner or later...maybe tomorrow, maybe next week...maybe a year from now...  I'll go right out the window.
Yes...How's Billy?
Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
What?
Only can I still see him?
I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
I don't know, Jim...
Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
No, but--
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
Slow down...Slow down...
Thel, listen to me.  If, on the million to one shot that I should--  That anything should happen to me.  Would you take care of Billy?
Khambas are wild men.
Tell me.
No cried?
Can I free the prisoners?
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
Chairman Mao can keep China. Just give us back Tibet.
I will not approve it.
Yes, but they say he did.
If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
Cow.
I pooped.
Not until you are eighteen.
It is an island. American territory.
I do not know, Holiness.
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
But you will always be here?
I have smarter men.
Ahh.
It may not be your decision to make.
It is possible, Holiness.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
Like my mother.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
The <u>reason</u> I lied is if I'd told you the truth, you'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you're doing.
Go ahead.
<u>So</u> <u>why</u> <u>are</u> <u>we</u> <u>landing</u>?  <u>Hector</u>.
He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
Mr. Cyr!
They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
You don't like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods--
Well until we see it, we're not gonna be convincing too many people.
I'm sorry but you're...
In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
Good luck.
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
Um... y'know...  Yeah.
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
Thank you.
Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
We could <u>not</u> say it and...  Well, that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to...
What?
Calm down.
Look.
He's floating.  Take it home.
Good thinking.
Where is he?!
I'll take it!
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
Well.  At wakes.
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
You like Jack?
I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?
She's worried about the cow now.
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
A jerk.
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
Part of our research--
I love it when you talk dirty.
Stay cool. Just remember to call him "God."
Why not?
It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...
Listen, I hope you never need a thing I've taught you. But you've got something... Jack sees it, I do too. If you ever need to, you can shoot.
Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.
Good idea.
Jack Gordon.
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me...
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
Let's get some coffee and talk.
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.
No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.
Did you ever work with her?
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
Sometimes you do.
How many women has he used, our Bill?
Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
I didn't.
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
If you didn't kill him, then who did?
That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
Who killed your patient?
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
They all were.
Did he try to?
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
On what basis would they reject him?
How would he test?
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
Promise...?  Then why not take your case file? I won't be needing it anymore.
I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.
I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
Can we rest soon?
Absolutely.
What?!
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
Thank you so much.
Because what I am interested in is right here...
What would you have me do?
Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something.
"Some"?
I am sorry, Duncan...
I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
Major!  Some day I think you and I are gonna have a serious disagreement.
Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
We'll see in the morning...
You're not coming with us?
No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
Atten-hut!
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
For Munro children?
Heart. Give Magua new heart.
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...?
My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
Granted, Monsieur.
For this...you don't need to be.
It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water.  Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... <u>adapted</u>.
How much time does that give us?
What's your air reading?
Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
That <u>thing</u> happens to be my friend.
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
He's tanking on us...
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
No fuckin' lie...
"Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
The air's stopped.
Your pocket?
Jesus, Tom, do they work?
I still will, if you don't mind.
And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know.
They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?
And Tom took care of them.
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
I think I can help you, as it happens.
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
They were going to pay, then?
I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John.
Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
All right, Dad.
Well, put your seatbelt on then.
That's no way to answer the phone.
I got the money to pay for 'em.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
Er well, yes we do.
But...  Give it us here, you dozy sod. You hide and get the guns ready. Wait until they are well in, then give it to 'em.
Even if they could they'd be too shit scared. They have got no muscle; they're gutless faggots.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
Do you want me to draw a picture?
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
Doesn't sound very good to me.
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
I think you're Nick the Greek.
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
How many feet?
We need fertilizer, Winston.
I mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your average hort-er-fucking-culturalist, that's what I mean, Willy.
Just shut up.
--you're going to be on your own.
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
That isn't true.
And what did she do?
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
Yeah, this is Skinny.
You got a cause of death?
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
I never met her.
There was a bunch of 'em You never met. Me neither.
They got tired of fighting, went to the Indian Territories for a while. But the slave-raiders were on 'em even there, and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle Pass.
But they were Indians themselves.
Didn't have a father?
He's still pissed off about it.
So I'm part-Indian?
By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
Dad, can I talk to you about track?
How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?
You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
Cliff--
Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
Sheriff Deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday.
Appreciate it, sir.
That's where he fell.
You get much of that in here?
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
Protection?
Aqui! [Here!]
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
I thought you were married!
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
Don't worry about it. He owes me some favors.
He was a unique individual.
Hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
That's a matter of interpretation--
We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
No.
He still living?
We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
Hey, Sam.
Open late.
Widow's benefits. He figured it would make the disappearance look better, and that Mexican gal was just scrapin' by after Charley killed her man. They didn't get hooked up till late--
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
He had the club out on the old trail road--
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
Not if I can help it.
You had to deal with him in running the club.
And my father?
And that was the last time you saw him?
Could of been. That was white people's business.
Yeah. How about that? People start digging holes in this county, there's no telling what'll come up.
Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
I only went for my last two years.
Three months.
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
I remember him watching me once. When I was little--before you and I--
Yeah.
I mean what did we know about anything?
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
Couple months before I was born--
He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.
Yeah--
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
Uh-huh.
They got telephones.
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
You'd do a good job.
I appreciate you telling me.
Just doing my job.
You suckers haven't had a good day since the Alamo.
That the problem, son?  You Slow?
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
What's up?
I haven't seen anybody come by.
So when did Buddy leave?
You think he killed anybody in Korea?
Houston, huh? I hear they let you boys run wild up there.
So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?
Yeah.  It's French.
That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
I told you --
What do you mean, "all of us?"
And are you afraid?
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
And you don't ask questions?
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
Harry.
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
Why?  Because he had you?
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
You said you weren't with him for love.
I think so.
New one on me.  Okay.  Let's see him.
Another fucking magician. Jesus.
I'd like to hear them.
He was a freak.  Everything he did was tainted.
Are you a gambling man?
Why'd you come here?
A ticket home,
Yeah, I know.
Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
What?
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
Sure.  Vivovich.
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
For an introduction.
Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
Looks that way.
You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
In my time, and nobody else's.
What is?
You don't think I've got it to give?
Binding you.
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
Bob, it's me.
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
Philosophy.
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
I know.
We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
How old is she?
Oh, she'll love it.
You think so?
Working.
Yes, but no, I can't right now.
Hi, Bob.
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
Yes?
Yes?
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
When are you coming home?
Great.
Hospital?
Good...I'm tired.
Are you sure you have to go?
It's cool... but,I don't know... I went to a shrine today and all these little monk's were chanting... and, I didn't feel anything... I even tried ikebana, ...   and John's using hair products... I don't know who I—.
No!  Hi! So great to meet you!
It's Susan's cooking, Claire.  That's why Uncle James lets them stay.
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
Claire...
I found them in your file box.
Yes.  It's exactly...
What time did you make it for?
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
You should know I never felt Mr. Birdson needed anything but professional psychiatric care.  And then, minutes after they left, he suffered a stroke. He's comatose.  No brain wave activity at all.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
He spoke to you?
You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself.  He created the voices after the fact.
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
Then why are you here?
No oxygen to the brain.
What did he say to you in French?
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
I'm not waiting until it's too late.
Lemme guess.  The lottery.
Thanks for having me, Sally.
Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that?
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
Don't curse.
So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
That's ridiculous.
But you use potato?
You're a caterer?
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
You want the job or not?
Gotta wait til the press conference.
Get used to it, babe.
You might be the only one with a job.
Mom's going to hate it.
Mom tell you to do this?
How'd you get him to say yes?
Too many times.
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
I know.  But chances are...
You were trying to make me look bad.
How's that been?
You're stupid.  And your Daddy plays for the worst team in the NBA.
Didn't know you cared so much.
Didn't know you cared so much.
You don't look half-bad.
You either.
You having fun?
None of your business.
That what you think?
You sure?
Clothes.
She understands.
I've been trying to find you all day.
What the hell's going on?
I don't think so.
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
Cause I don't get it.
What?
It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that was five years ago.  I moved on.
So?
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
I've been hearing you.
Sorry.  You okay?
So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.
Didn't we already have this conversation?
What?
Why?
Your door was unlocked.
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
You want me to fuck off?
You ok?
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --
Well what's the situation?
Sure is.  So why call me?
No.  No.
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
No one else in there with you?
Yeah, but I don't know --
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
No.
I was...he's gone...I mean it's not. It's over, y'know --
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
I don't have a boyfriend.
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
Good bye.
No, no.
I'm sorry --
Can I tell you something?
What?
I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
I'm sorry --
It's ok.
Yes.
You mind if I come in, check things?
I want a shot of tequila too.
It doesn't matter.
Ready to go,go,go?
I don't know, Richard, they need to talk it over --
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
No Can Do.
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
Now that shit will help you SOLVE the case.
What happend?
Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
Well --
You mind your own bussines.
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
Yes.
I need to sit down.
No.
She loves you.
How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
This isn't meant --
-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
I'm quietly judging you.
My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
And your father?
people die.
"Frank" was my mother's father.
Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
Uh. huh.
It's interesting.
Mmm.
...just wait...Dad...you want something...can you say...
You're here.
I'm not askin', Marcie.
I went out last night.
Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
No.
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
Yeah. Yes.
I won't.
I got in trouble at school.
As fast as I can.
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....
hey.
Just once.
Is it over 'cause you're sick?
I think that you know.
Maybe...I don't...
I don't know.
Not as much as I used to.  Ever since we started, I haven't really gone in to school that much because I've been getting more and more auditions --
When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
What does that mean?
....it's alright....
Phone number.
I'd like to get an order of...um...peanut butter.
-- talk in the car, talk in the car, moves your ass, c'mon --
Go to bed.
It's not right.
My guards are useless!  Take her from me!
Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
A body.
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!
Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
You can't do it.
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
Forgiveness?
I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
We go someplace dangerous.
I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
At a ball, everyone watches the King!
So what?  I'd rather die covered in blood, than an old man, lying in my own piss.
I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
Raoul, no... You cannot do this.  No matter how your heart is broken --
Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
Who came?
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us behave as if my wish is law.  And my wish is to enjoy this party!
I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow.
He is my brother.
Sire, I --
No, you may wait behind the screen.
What do you need?
Alright, stay on the phone.
Did you report it stolen?
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
Yeah...
Gotta come from somewhere...
Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.
Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!
Yeah?
Could explain why Fleming was there.
He said he was following up some lead.
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
LAPD data center reports a breach on the system.  An outside hacker has accessed files on Detectives Fleming and Stanton...and yours too, Marvosa.
Seattle.
I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
Jesus, man...
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
I'll access the LAPD mainframe, but we gotta be careful - that one's kind of tricky -
I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change, I guess.
Both at the same bank...
I'm not going anywhere!
Tubbs, these people mean business.
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
What?
I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
I wouldn't presume to try.
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
Could he handle a direct contact?
No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible.
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
'You're very beautiful.
I'll try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
What else did you keep out of the papers?
That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
It's your call, Will. What do we do?
I'll pick you up in...
No.
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
Tonic will be fine.
It's me.
Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
In a little while I'll help you understand.
Yes.
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
No.
Three, four hours.
Yeah...
Atlanta and Birmingham.
He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
Hey, baby! Where are you?
Me, too. And very erotic...
Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us.  And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay...  He's after you now, isn't he?
Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
Then why?
Is Crawford going with you?
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Will?  You could come up here.
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
Are you gonna kill him?
No.
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
What disadvantage?
Yes.
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
You got it.
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
That's... terrific!  But I got something better.  This is BIG...  You are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!!
What's up?
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
And that's great.  But do it in LA and New York!  There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage!  I don't care!
Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
So who's gonna pay for it?
Tony Clifton.
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
You were impressed with something. It's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television.
Yes.
You're a wimp.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Each show is worse than the next.
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
It's working for Elvis.
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
Why??  I... I attend every year.
I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
He said he's coming back!
SHUT UP!  I hate them Polish jokes!
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
He'll be contacting us again.
Oh shit.
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
Oh, God.
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
What are you doing?
You have to focus.  There is a phone.  Wells and Lake.  You can make it.
Go.
Shit!  Apoc?
You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
Wild, isn't it?
You -- you're too fast.
How?
No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
The beginning?
And you still believe I'm the One?
Yes I do.
Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
We're on our way --
What vase?
What do you mean, without him?
It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
Are you worried?
Yes.
What happened?  What did you see?
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?
What choice?
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
What?
It wasn't fast enough.
They're hacking his mind.
Depends on the mind.  But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
I can't!
Hurry, Neo.
Look who's talking.  Pretentious bullshit.  Who's the guy with William Blake and the tigers, eh?
So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
Yeah.
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
And say what?
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
What do you mean?
I could have told you that.
I'll be here.  Don't worry.
He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.
How much was the original loan again?
Charlie, this is business.
Fine.
I know.
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
No you weren't.
Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
What do they expect you to say?
Maybe, who knows.
No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
Ok.
No.  Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?
Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
Girls?  You call those skanks girls?!
 Shut up.
Hi, Allison --
No.
And you could care less --
A name?
Of course.
The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
He said he would be there with bells on.
9:30's almost 10:30.  Where I come from, the sun's over the yardarm, m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit.
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
I'm sorry, I don't recall --
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
Then why did you bring it up?
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
'Yes'.
Maybe, who knows?  You know how voices are.  Let's go.
Did you just hear something?
It's going to be great --
Like a marriage made in heaven?
Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?  Another one of his whoppers?  Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? No one knows who he is, but one thing everyone does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since.
No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
Yeah.
Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.
No, I come to see Doctor.
My Doctor Lady?
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
Can do no right by people.  Come to take, you wan' to stay, leave you stay, you wan' to go.  Rahtid!
Hi, Jennifer.
Nothing?
The Board is waiting.
I didn't know that.
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
I've got plenty of friends.
I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
I'm sorry to say I know what you're saying.
I don't mind --
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
Faster.  And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever.
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
'Love will find out the way'.
It's a saying.
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
Closer than that.
Not at all.
It is a deal?
What do you mean?
I understand.
Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
This part I'm interested in.
You were just curious?
Then I can't help you.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Good.  Tomorrow, after the party.
You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway?
Then what is it?
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
An offense --
Thank you.
What?
Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
Yes, Bill.  The question.
I am, this is it.  B Day.
Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
...Then don't.
Bravo.
He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
Then what is it?
Joe?
C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
I'm sorry --
Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
But we've got time.
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99
It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
I'm sorry... um... ?
He's not my friend, Burt. But if he calls, or if he turns up here, then you give me a call in my room, okay?
Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
Hi, Leonard.
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
You did.
Thanks.
Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man? Where the fuck's Teddy?
I don't want blood on them.
Look, there's two hundred grand stashed in the car. Just take it!
I don't want your fucking money!
Why?
It's isolated.
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
Yeah?
Shut the fuck up!
Why not?
My boyfriend told me about you.
So why did you come here?
Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please.
John Gammell?
Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
Why?
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
I'll ride with him. You follow.
I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
Who's she?
What sort of questions?
He knows you're no good on the phone, so		    * he calls you up to bullshit you.				  * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so			* he slips something under your door to			  * frighten you into answering your phone			 * again. He's been pretending to help you.		    * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.		    * being some local drug dealer.					*
Wouldn't be appropriate.						*
There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
Are you sure?
To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many		    * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
Your name's Teddy.
This bad cop. He checked you into the			  * Discount Inn. Then he's been calling you		    * for days, sticking envelopes under your			* door, telling you shit.						 *
His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check		   * your tattoos.							 *
Fuck you; I gave you a reason to live and		   * you were more than happy to help. You lie		   * to yourself! You don't want the truth,			 * the truth is a fucking coward. So you			  * make up your own truth.						 *
I was the kids' godfather.
I got to talk to my ADO...
Okay.  You got the "item"?
Two main players plus three.
Havana.
Where's she now?
Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
What do you mean?
Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
Alonzo...
Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...?
"No, viejo.  That was José Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
What's the point?  It's going down.
Then you should.
If you're down, we're down for the play.
This is Agent James Fujima.
What's your Miami PD badge number?
How do I know?  I got the call from Alonzo on an open line.  That is the hand we have been dealt at this moment, at eleven-forty-seven o'clock Friday night.  Okay?  I am trying to alert you, here.  <u>You</u> know whether or not...you have a thing goin' down.  I do not.  But we know this guy.  I think you know this guy.  Normally, he is cool.  Tonight he is distraught. That is atypical.  That engenders foreboding.  Do you understand the meaning of the word "foreboding"? As in badness is happening to <u>your</u> deal right fucking now?
We don't know.
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
Never heard of him.
From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.
Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
What's it say?
Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
Meaning...?
Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...
<u>You</u> give <u>yours</u> to me.  <u>We</u> position all the assets hauling our loads...
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
I know. Scribbage!
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.
You inviting shee-it.
Whatsa matter now?
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
Who'd you ever do a favor for? You just let some poor bastard freeze to death, wouldn't you?
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
You want me to leave?
This is terrible. I meet someone who -- then -- wait, I want to give you a present. For your trip. You'll let me please...
Yessir, I can see that.
Get down -- where?
Is he all right!
Olsun - "May it pass quickly." I'm Bell, Jimmy Bell. This is Erich something Swedish.
Listen!
The catacoombs?  Whaddya want, a door?  There's miles of em like a sewer system but they got to come up someplace in Istanbul.
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
Yes...?
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
I don' t know. It's someplace down in there....  ..deep.. A big door...a wheel....
What?  You gotta be joking.
Maybe he's changing jobs.
Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
Learn what?
I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
I pull.
Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
Even if they did... that's all we have, isn't it?
It didn't bite me.
I know.  But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
The scent won't last...
Jump in.
Gross. What is it?
I have no idea.  Are you ready?
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
What are they...?
It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe... 
You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
I don't have a title yet.
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
It has no nobility.
Your agent said she would tell her you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself.
I guess that means it's okay.
I know how that can be.
No big deal.
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
What's the matter? I'll tell you what's the matter. I go out of my way for you. I do everything to try and make you happy. I feed you, I clean you, I dress you. And what thanks do I get? "You bought the wrong paper, Annie. I can't write on this paper, Annie." Well, I'll get your stupid paper, but you just better start showing me a little more appreciation around here, Mister Man.
I can't write this anymore.
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
A toast?
The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.
Three more chapters to go.
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
What thing?
There's that spice again.
I don't know. Does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels?
Answer me a couple things?
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
Marcia, please.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.
Sean, please..
What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
To do what?
Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
Oh.  then you knew the only way could smuggle the live virus to the CDC scientists in Atlanta was by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a Petri dish, doing it inside of twenty hours so he could take the anti-virus and still have it be effective.  You knew that while you were knocking him off and destroying the very thing you came for.
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
Ninety-three point four million.
Which means, Mr. McCloy, we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options.  We'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options.  Your stock's never sold above thirty-one dollars a share.  We'll agree to buy at fifty.
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO.
I'm not ready!
No.  Should I?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh?
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
Oh, either way works for me.
Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
They've got a book for everything.
Five, six-hundred thousand.
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
Something like that.
Can you think of a better one?
Much.
Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
You don't trust me.
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
Just like old times?
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
Why did you phrase it like that?
Like what?
You gotta be kidding.
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.
Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
Very.
No.  I can't afford to be curious.  And neither can you, Hunt..
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
I do.
No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>
The satellite doesn't work as fast as I do.
Why not?
Roger that.
You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
Do I?
You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
Fold it.  Fold it tight.
We got it.  On your feet.
Talking's good, walking's better.
Sleeping's better.
Roger that.
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
Who is "they?"
Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
I'm going to answer it.
Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say that Claire.
Yes.
Yeah.  I follow you.
Why was there another team?
What?
I don't quite follow you.
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like you said.  You survived.
Certainly Ethan.
Information.
Profitable.
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
IMF mainframe.
What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
Jim we canít.
Why?
What problem?
Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
Sure.  If the main character does.
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.
Donít flatter yourself - six was for <u>Eastern Europe</u>.  You made a lousy deal - ten for the world?  What is that?  But I needed you for the transfer with Max.  I got a little extra change;  and you got a little extra too.
Ethan - Iíve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you.
Itís not working.
Phew!  Weíve got five minutes...
We will both have the Salad Ticino.
Why you drinking so much?
And go to confession.
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
What killed him?
I won't come.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
I got it done.
You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
Good morning, Lucy.
You are going to marry my brother?
You don't have to help me.
He knew my husband who died.
Yesterday.
No.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
Why you talking to me?
I'm telling you your life!
Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
I was dead, too.
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
I'll come to the wedding.
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
You look beautiful. Your hair...
Yeah.
And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
And you're not now?
Let me go home.
Loretta, what are you talking about?
Yeah, I'll be in.
Johnny.
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too.
My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
I shouldn't.
What?
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
I don't understand.
Alright. A month. In a month.
The waitresses were very nice.  My mother is slipping away.
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
We should talk alone.
I have no secrets from my family.
Pop don't like Johnny.
What! How do you know?
He's with his dying mother!
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
I know.
I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.
Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked my advice. If he asks my advice, I don't know what I will say.
Did you see the moon last night?
That's incredible.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
Of course I want to.
It was a miracle!
But absolutely!
I am alone in the world.
Absolutely!
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
Sure.
I'm a little cold.
Yes.
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
You're using coconuts!
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
What is that?
What?
What?
Come Here.
What are you going to do. bleed on me?
This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.
Behind the rabbit?
What?
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Shut up!
Bloody peasant! 
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
... Well, we did do the nose.
To find the Holy Grail.
What is your favorite colour?
Blue.
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
Why?
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
I can understand that.
Camelot?  Are you from Camelot?
What - the curtains?
You're not going to do a song while I'm here!
Until you, or anyone else ...
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.
I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
It's too perilous.
... I Bet you're gay.
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
Well, let's not jump to conclusions ...
You've said it!  Aaaaarghhh! ... We've said it ... Wwe're all saying it.
Brave, Sir Rob ...
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
Not bad, not bad.
So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
Get out.  Out!
It's what the maids are for.
I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
Louder, girl!
I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
It's so infernally cold in here.
... Least of all my son.  It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant.
Back and upper corridors.
You'll be sent a message.
I'm fine.
You're injured.
I wouldn't know.
I said.  I serve the Queen.
She trusts you, John.
And the pony?
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
I am told so.
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
I came as quickly as I could.
But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.
We'll see which way the wind blows.
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
How ill is he?
What is he doing there?
Why?
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond as fast as you can.  But what can I do for you?
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible.
How'd you know it was us?
Security camera.  Pulled your files before I came down. Be careful what you say, kids ... I know where you live.
It's the game, ARCADE.
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
Did you play ARCADE last night?
But you always lie, so you didn't come from there.  That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth.
All of them?
Like the fractals?
...but then it hits the relay stations...
The Police, then...
Then where do we go?!
They made ARCADE.  It's still a game, right?  It thinks like a game.  Maybe it still has to play by the rules. Someone had to program it in the first place, didn't they?.
And beat it at it's own game.
You didn't hear me?
Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
One.  In case...
Screamer.
I just thought of something.  If we came back from the game...  ...what if ARCADE did too?
I know.
Is it?  Why don't you see for your self?
Of course I can.  I can say all sorts of things...
I'm going home.
You're broke!
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
So why did you idiots bring me here? ... I'm in the middle of making a picture.
Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
You're an understandin' fella.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
Sweetie, look at me straight.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.
No. I can't.
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...
How do you remember how to talk?
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
Not that I can see.
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
"Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."
You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.
Those men in front, in the car.
Wally Brown.
Thank you... thank you very much.
Go ahead.
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
Well ... it's the second one I've had, but they were both the same......they start out that I'm in here but it's not day or night. It's kinda half night, but it looks just like this except for the light, but I'm scared like I can't tell ya. Of all people you're standing right over there by that counter. You're in both dreams and you're scared. I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are and then I realize what it is - there's a man...in back of this place. He's the one ... he's the one that's doing it. I can see him through the wall. I can see his face and I hope I never see that face ever outside a dream.
Right then.
Could be unrelated.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
Hardly.
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
Pick with expediency !
Jesus, my legs are asleep. I'll never be able to win this shit.
No time. Get him up.
No !
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
I'm not listening.
I'm listening.
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
Okay.
Fine...
I work here, remember ?
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.
When I think you're ready.
Trust is earned not given away.
Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.
Any priors ? Any police record ?
Checking........
Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
Bruce has just awaken.
I'll see that bet.
Well, Mr. Parker it seems that your is not the wardrobe of choice tonight. I'm quite confident that my tie is looking better than yours.
Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
Sure.
Why don't you shut up now.
I'm going to go ahead and go now.
Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
I don't think you're very polite.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
I already bought a ticket.
I used my own money and got a great deal, it's a Q47NR five day fare, which means that I have to change planes in Dallas and stay over a Saturday.
And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
Give my love to Shelly.
You can do anything you want. You're his sister.
Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
I'm sorry, it's just...I've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and...sometimes it gets out of hand.
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
I've got something better.
Honey I'd be proud to be your father, really. It just isn't so.
Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.
Ehh...I'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you're the best Jag people in town...so uhm.
Then I have come to the right place.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
Don't wake up Vada.
No THANKS!
Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
WHAT??
Oh my gosh, here it is!
I love the fragrance of chilidogs.
I think it's cool.
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
He's an undertaker.
Nick?
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
An adventure?
I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.
Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.
Bye.
Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.
Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.
Right now? An intimate border with...mechanical skills.
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.
Well you've gotta be prepared.
I'm definitely traveling some day.
What do you mean?
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
You leave your father to me.
Hey! Oh look.
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
The bee stings! I can't breathe!
I think it's still available.
The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot;
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
Really?
Pointing upwards Look...
I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
Perfect.
I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't ignore the living, especially your daughter.
Hand me the canula.
Is it for a child?
Sorry.
No, sweetie, not yet.
He was allergic to bees.
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to lie to your big brother?
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
Sure.
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
That's Suzanne.  She and I are gonna be married this Fall.
Why do you think she says that?
You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
That's really cool.
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
Can we look around in your camper?
What are they about?
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.
I'm hemorrhaging.
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
It's a mosquito bite.
No.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
No, I don't wanna.
Come on, it's fun.
Yes.
What do you think it's like?
I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll never find that streamer.
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
Go???
So?
But I have my clothes on!
Do it!
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
Uh huh.
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
What?
For what?
I'll call George's parents. Tell them I need a best man who actually looks after me.
He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
You have a real philosophy of life.
I can see why.
The man you love.
Needing.
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
No.
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
I just think you're wrong, is all.
... unless he has a hump.
... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
Nobody has.  So far.
Firenze.
Well.
ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
The most important thing. Is being together.
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
No.
All those people...
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
You remember what I said about the Vitamins.
Okay, I just wanted to see if I could help out at all.
He knows better.
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
What does he want?
I don't care. She's always been neutral in politics and that's not going to change.
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
Bill, he's a crazy man.
Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
Some guy was drunk and hit him. Accident. Haven almost killed him.
Haven's not going to talk to me.
I'm fine. Can I go up?
Let me see if I can get the doctor hold on one second.
A little. What do you need?
She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
That Tom sure is cute.
Who's that?
Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Next you'll be sick.
I feel really good.
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
Bye.
Well, can you tell me why?
It just is.
About three years.
Linnea?
I'm here.
Tom. You remember?
Yes.
Oh, Tom, of course. What are you doing in Nashville?
Oh.
I'm not sure.
Older than thirty?
Come on, you ever been attracted to a black guy?
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
Thanks. You are just a wonderful person.
Hello.
He's pretty well known down here.
Yes.
You're real favorites of his.
An album.
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
Hello.
Southern California.
Who?
I'll be dammed.
Is that good?
I know that you are an artist and I am sure you are very religious.
So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
Yes, you are.
What...
Don't stop!
Susanville, Soledade.
I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.
She was born without a tongue.
Do you have a back up.
Ready.
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
Was what worth it?
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
No.
Yes.
I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
Only on a much grander scale.
Schwartzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along.
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
It's hard to say Capt'n.
Jesus...
Thanks.
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
I assigned you Bingham and Washington to go along.
How 'bout Mallory?
Tomorrow.
But you'll never be whole again.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
And me.
I didn't mean they were assholes. I mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta here.
Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for you to film there.
You think so, Frankie?
Okay.
Where was that?
Make sure he gets those shots.
People seen him 'round.
Just so you do your work.
I don't know.
Like hell they wouldn't.
Oh yeah?
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
Oh yeah? That's good.
You work around town?
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
Scared, huh?
Okay, I guess.
You know, I been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?
Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
Don't push me, Duff.
Let's just see how the two of us make out first, huh?
Am I as good as they?
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
You still didn't answer my question.
My kids want me to teach them.
Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
Well, he ain't mine, so skip it.
Stop bein' so damn understandin'.
What d'you mean?
Nothin. Quit lookin' at me like that!
There's nothing to say.
You don' know nothin' 'bout it, baby. Nothin'! And don't kid yourself - you did your bit.
Why don't you relax, Frankie?
Take it easy, Frankie.
'Got a good thing, man.
Yeah. That's right.
'Don't sound so sure.
Beat it!
Just tryin' to be helpful.
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
It ain't in me.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
He's my son!
Like hell you ain't!
Better now.  Where 'you at?
Anything you say, baby.
You hate Raoul?
Sometimes.  And sometimes I don't--  Shut the fuck up!
Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
Since when?
I'm still on my honeymoon.
Don't play with me.
He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
Why not?
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
What's he doing to my gear?
Did you trace it?
No, but it traced me.
The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run.
Are you even really alive?
My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.
Yeah.
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
All things possible in Babylon.
The girl 3Jane. We need her.
Right...
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
Who got you into this?
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
You cruise A.I.'s, you end up on tape.
What are you talkin' about?
I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
Case.
What?
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
Why should I want to meet him.
What?
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
Too late?
Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera.
Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
No we don't...
What is it?
Who?
What are you talking about?
Sure. No problem.
This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
It is?
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
YOU KNIT?
If you say so.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Anita!
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
That is lingerie.
Very romantic.
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.

Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
Hey--I can be out of control.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Uhh, no.
Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
Cool. I'll catch you later.
Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
You're twenty-three years old!
Really?
College. Haven't really thought about it.
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
Why do you do that?
That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
Yeah, I have.
I don't know.
You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
<i>                      Three of a kind...</i>
If you went away, what would become of me?
I know.
Taste it.
Why not?
Can't you make other creations?
Experiments?
Who's Lisa?
Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
I don't know!  I just know he needs help and we don't know how to give it to him.
Only the wet ones.
No!  I don't know - everything's all mixed up.  What difference does it make?  I'm in trouble here.  I need your help.
It's happening again.
I know.
That's typical.  I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
I don't know.
I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!
Make a left at this corner.
I thought you might be able to make a connection.
I killed him!  I killed him!
Eggs?
Fine.
Okay...thanks.
We're going to bed.
Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.
I'm sure you would.
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
I am not going to let you get me into an argument, goddamn it.  Not tonight.  Now get in bed.
Please Mom?  I just don't want to be alone.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Yes.  I'm going to see her tonight.
But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
Let's try this way.
So...got the keys to heaven, baby.
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
Anything?
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
Didn't get much sleep.
Must have opened while I was away at school.
I'm serious.
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
That's right.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
Remember -- open mind.
Everybody take five.
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
Cooling down.
Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
This is stupid.
And then I... right.
Films mainly.
Do you always say 'no' to everything?
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
Okay.
No, I didn't.
A bath would be great.
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
Well, get a message through to him too.
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
Oh.
How do you think I'm doing?
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.
You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
What's the thing?
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
I haven't decided.
Crazy.  Go along Bayswater...
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
Ah... yes, enormously.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
So it could have been neither of them?
I suppose so.
Not classic, no.
Can I help you?
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
You see -- it means 'yes.'
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
No, don't think I do.
Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath.
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
Good luck.
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
Which was?
Sort of.
I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
Spike!
I'm sorry.  Which hospital?
Yes.
No. Mister Harding, that is not true.
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Will you come with me, please.
Yes... We were discussing Mister Harding's problem with his wife. Now, who will start?  Billy.
What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
I hope everything is settled.
H-H-Hearts.
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
So long, kid.
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan...
Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
Ca-na-da...
Let me get on your shoulders.
Right, Mack!
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
Huh?
Lemme see...
I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
That!
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
With your own two hands?
I'm busting outta this place.
I was open! Come on, let's play ball!
Scanlon out!
What's he talkin' about?
Hit me.
Me. Hit me!
No! I wanna go!
No. Me! Me!
He's not!
In what way?
The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that?
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
Are you a doctor?
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
Shhh!  This way!
Sure...
Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
Yes, ma'am...
Oh...
Jus' playin' the game, sucker...
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first...
Your mother.
I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass we can't let you on the plane.
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
Yes.
My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
Dwayne Pinsley.  From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport.
I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
Amazing.
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
Where's Positano?
Nice dress.
No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Are you asking me out?
Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
Very funny.
There is no us.
Tonight?
Well, not exactly...
Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Don't worry about it.  You're my guest.
Mommy, this is Faith.
No.  He smokes.
I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
You don't have any idea?
I know...  It was.
You don't have a passport.
Of course not.  I told him I was going to visit a great aunt.  And don't tell Larry, either.
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
Live happily ever after.
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
So?
A Butterfinger wrapper.
Right.  My brother.
You're right.  At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  Smile.
Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
And then what, Faith?
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
I didn't expect you back so soon.
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
What?  You know him?
Larry, you've got to tell her.
She's not here.
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
That's all. Next witness!
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local— that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady— well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out— we take our cut.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the— er— as you put it— main order of business?
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
I don't know— I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped—
Don't say that!
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in—
Man, you were a mess!
The moment I saw you.
With a little more patience and kindness. That's what makes people mean and difficult. Nobody cares enough about them.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
How do you like that one?
Oh she's a beauty.
Want to go out and have one with me?
How do you like it?
How about another one?
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But— I didn't stay in shape— and—  —I had to take a few dives.
What made you want to be a fighter?
Much more, Terry. Much, much more!
You... .
I know what you want me to do!
Edie...
I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
He wanted to see me again.
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
Your gun.
What did you say?
A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley— and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom— with the truth as you know it—  Truth is the gun— Drop that thing and tell the truth— a more dangerous weapon than this little —  —cap pistol.
I can? Okay.  Okay...
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
Such as what?
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and—
Yeah— us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
My favorite little cousin.
Well, no, Johnny, I just thought I should've been told if—
Keep Charley out of this.
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
Then..then what's that music?
Something's making that music.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
Nothing is worth your life.
The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.  Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...
Oh, if there is only time!
You better hope there is.
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
What do you suppose for?
Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
I said not as a rule.
No, thanks.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
You did work for Emil, right?
Go away, or I'll call the police.
Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
Shit.
Uh-huh...
She just sat there, looking right at me.
She came up here on her vacation, 'cause she likes shitty weather.
Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.  Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it.
I saw Karen Sisco.
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
That's all I wanted to know.
Yeah, why?
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
Another C.
Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
I've seen 'em used on TV.
In my bag, in the car.
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
And your gun.
A girl.
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
Or once.
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
The backseat.
These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
Of course not.
It's a big house.
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?
Meaning?
I don't know.  It's a long way down to Florida.
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
Really?
Me?
I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
I think you're forgetting, this is my car.  I drove it up here.
No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
How you know that?
Flyweight.
You're not my type.
I'm looking for Maurice.
It's a --
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
Technically.  They're separated.
Can we change the subject?
Off a tip?
He's pretty laid back, confident.
My little girl, the tough babe.
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
That's right, just me.
No.  Course not.
So the woman's married.  She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.  But you don't reveal her name, you protect her.  It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.  Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
Still...
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
Where you been hiding, Dick?
Where the fuck is Foley?
I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads.
You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.
But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
Sir?
I was grieving too.
Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
Home of the brave.
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
Bullshit.  We've played with each other, pushed each other.  This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me.  Who's that for -- Evelyn?
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
Thank you, Sir.
You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together.  Do you know what top secret is?
Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
Sorry to trouble you.
What do you get for winning?
You too, 'Mam.
We're all going away.
But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
Do one thing for me, before you go.
Nothing that won't heal.  I guess.
Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
That's what I have to tell you, Rafe.  It wasn't a choice.  It --
There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
The time has come to strike!  Or to sit and let the Americans cut off our oil and our future.  I know what you whisper to the others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans are strong.  Yet look at their leader.
I remember that book!  Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something.
The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one.
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
Don't say that...
...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something.
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie.  Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway.
Pretty strange.
Maybe I blocked it out.
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
Charlie. About last nights..
Why?
I have to talk to you..
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
You're going to listen to me.
What?
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
I'll never give up.
Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can...
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
Test?
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
Touchy, touchy!
First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie.
He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.
Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
Don't you get along with your parents?
Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.
What?
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
This morning was good.
The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
I'm home now.
I don't feel very festive.
Okay, what do you want? What dumb favor do you want me to do?
They're bad for you. They cause...red lips. 
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
You're a sweet man, Richard.
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it four—thirty. I have a rocket club meeting.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
I don't know.
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
What do you know about hypnosis?
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
Exactly! I thought it might be some sort of blood condition... immune deficiency or...
Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
I'm not hungry.
You never get over it.
Go later...
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
I miss him too...
You know everything, don't you?
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
A reaction to AZT...
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
I hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on.
More than your friend. Family.
Your Honor, I submit there were no complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. Each time it has been examined and the results...
One week old.
Little baby girl.
Makeup.
Rayisha.
Rayisha. Very nice.
Not bad.
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
What impressed you about him?
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens.
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
Absolutely.
Objection.
Your earrings?
I'll rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
Wyant Wheeler represented us.
That's correct.
According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
That's perfectly clear.
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
You had one guy "like that?"
Beckett?
Jesus.
Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive.  Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed.
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....
Can we switch?
Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
Tell me it's not a mirage.
So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
Well, don't ask me to.
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock.
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we're in Skiff City! So why don't you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get --
How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
Company's not here, is it?
70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
Quiet, please. Everyone.
He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
Like an emergency life-raft, right?
We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
Wanna rag your fat mouth?
Said "looks clear."
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
Like who, Mr. Chrislam?
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
Do you have any weapons?
I know ... Nevertheless, I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there.
Good luck then.
What's so special about him?
Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
Geiger counter?
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
Blessed are the vegetarians.
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
Huh?
To Earth! That we've landed!
We're here to stay.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
But I'm not prepared to die.
Let's take a look.
You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
Yes, I can do that.
Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
What about it?
Okay.Up to the cave.
He doesn't know.
In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
Whaddaya talking shit for man. Hey Junior! Y'ever smoke any shit?
Das right dude. You be tryin' to string de black man out on dat shit and keep him DOWN. Time's be coming, my man, when de black man's gonna throw off that yoke.
Barnes comes from Hell.
You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.
I suggest you watch your own asses cause Barnes gonna be down on ALL OF 'EM.
Jes' fine man, jes fine! Ain't never felt better! Both of us two timers man, we're out.  See you at the hospital man, we gonna get high-high yessir... 
Yeah.
In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
Go on, whatcha gotta lose, yo' here now...
Fuck it, don't mean nothing, no such thing here as a coward, done your best man, next time y'do better.
Well sometimes a man jes don' wanna go back. How you gonna talk to civilians man? People back in the world just don't give a shit, y'know what I mean, to them you're a fuckin' animal is all -
Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
This is one time we could sure use Elias.
I'll make one for you.  I live there.
Well..
I don't know.
Not tonight.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
I'm sure you have.
Immigration Officer?
Crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. You'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. They might even want to know why you're in such a hurry.  Otherwise they might think...
I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.  Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
You're drinking it.
Do you think I don't?
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
I didn't notice him.
You don't know who he is?
From you, I like it.
You're probably mistaken about that.  Let's get together sand talk it over.  There's always a solution to these problems.  But it must be near the water.  Quite near--  Yes, if you don't mind waiting.
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
There would be a moon tonight.
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
Me?
Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
Where's you get it?
You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
I don't want to talk.
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichés, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
They call me Jeff.
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
Time's up.  I'm off the case. 
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
I can't answer that.
You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.
There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious, take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters.
Goodbye, Betty.
I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
What are your rates?
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
What's a buzzer?
So you're not a cop.
How's life treating you?
I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
I have a warrant for her arrest.
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
No idea.
What?
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
If you're asking my opinion, no. I'd read it to Greer over the phone. Ask him if he had any objections.
How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
Do I know who lives down there?
I've got to find a way to handle it, openly.  Like Brandon.
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
Thank you very much, Mrs. West.
She might.
I hear she's a very pretty girl.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
Two.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
Nice.
You ought to know why.
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
Correct. I couldn't even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me.
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
How about your new friend?
I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
Tom, Daddy would like to see you in the garden.  And will you ask Betty to bring us some coffee. And remember to say 'please'.
And I'd like you to call me Ann.
Yes.
We'll see you next week, and if--
Well, we were just...
Yes.
Very good.
Keep me company.
I see.
Good.
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
That's her.
Oh, but he was terrific.
I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
How nice.
That must be rather nice, in a way.  I mean, you don't have any--
In radio we're different.
I know.  I'm sorry.
The Argies.
You're so hard.  All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up.  I expressed an interest...
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
I'm off.  Let's meet.  You promised to tell me about Norfolk.
You're a piece of shit
Thanks.
I'm not here.
Come into the kitchen.  I'm just making your mother's tea.
Oh she knows you're very busy, especially now, with everything going on...the doctor said to try her on solids, but she's been right off her food...You take this up to her.  Tell her you made it.  She'll like that.
Oh no!
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
You first!
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
I'm not FBI anymore.
You never were...
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
Zero distortion, sir.
Babes.
Caught my first tube this morning.
Welcome to Sea World, kid.
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
Thanks for the tip.  I needed this knowledge.
Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
They took a left at the next light!
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
Catch of the day.
Meaning you were expendable.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
What?
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
Something... in the trees...
Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
The best friend I ever had.
I can't tell.
I think it's Hawkins.
There's no sign of it.
Philip!  We'll need shoes!
He's not really my uncle.
Not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights.  I'll get used to it.
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.
So do day jobs.
You mean they don't have hookers.
Exactly.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Do you plan everything?
Uh-huh.
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
Why?
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
I'd say you give a good dollar value.
"Occupational hazard".
I'm in town until Saturday.
Of course.  How much?
Three.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
Oooh!
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
Good.
Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it.  My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
What id we run into someone I know?
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
It was a business decision.
The young lady staying in your room?
Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
I'll bring it back.
I'm here.
I know a lot of nice girls.
No one you know.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Doing what?
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
Let him answer.
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
Dummy.
I pray for that.
What kind of school?
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
Vivian.
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
Miss Vivian.
I was in here yesterday.
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
He's really very short on charm.
If there are, we'll all be dead.
Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace.
Yeah. It's really good.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
You want me to read this or not?
I tell you once again -- surrender!
I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
Who won? How did it end?
The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
Of course.
I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? --
-- power too -- promise me that --
The King's stinking son fired me. And thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it? We're closed!
We're really in a terrible rush.
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
You never had it so good. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.
I'm not listening.
Nobody's hearing nothing!
An hour.
"To my honey I'll croon,
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
It's nothing ... nothing.
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
Aaaaaaaaaa!
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
Two pistachios, my good man.
I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.
Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
Come on.  Let's get going.
You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
By the sacred memory...
Of Siegfried...
Wagner...
Wagner...
The Graf Spee...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Heil you know who!
OH.  "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is not place to talk.  Come! 
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
What do you do best?
Send for Goebbels.
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
How early?
No.
What?
Anyone at home?
That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.
Money.
Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.
What are you talking about?  What is this?
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
Buzz me the minute she comes in.
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
He said he was dissatisfied... and was going back.
Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!
She haven't even called you?
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Sam.
Without calling me?
Huh?
I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
What?
Bates never denied Mary was here.
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
Why not?
We could laze around here a while longer.
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
Sam!
I can come down next week.
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
I'll lick the stamps.
We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.  They moved away the highway.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
I'm looking for a private island.
No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
Well? You meant well?  People always mean well, they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that...
Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
You slept here all night?
I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
Frankly, yes.
Please... I'd like to go...
Now wait just a moment! Turn your motor off, please.
Now what?
You didn't!  It's tinkerbell.  Al wants to be sure he'll hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night.  Well come on in, at least!
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
Maybe you saw Mary!
I'd know the difference between Mary and an old woman.
Arbogast.
Better sign in first, hasn't we?
Satisfied with your cabin?
Mother, please...
You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
Did she talk?
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
You--a friend to me?
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.
Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument.
Yes!
But ... the dogs...
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
Well, I do say it.
I'm not quarreling, only ...
They are.  My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night.
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
Are you giving me this straight?
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
Nope, I'm through!
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
What!
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
I see. Was that all she said?
You go in for dangerous things.
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
Thanks.
You taking any medication?
You did.
It's an experiment.
How?
I said she isn't here. NOW you go home. Be a nice boy and go home.
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
Nobody.
Did they try to induce you to become a prostitute?
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?
I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
What are you going to do, Rose?
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
Well, a little.
Well, yeah.
Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
And there's only one reason anybody would want this ladder -- to get up into Rose's bedroom in the dark of night! I am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it! -- and that is not all I am going to do!
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
Oh, yes, it's Thursday.  Hello, Rose, dear...  ... my, you're... looking pretty...
I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
Yeah.
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
Let me see!
You shouldn't watch such things, Doll.
That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
If it isn't a baby... what is it?
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
Is her husband sick or something?
It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
I don't see any bruises or broken bones.
Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.
Boys? You say to me boys?
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him.
Do you know what a friend you have got there? Do you know she would fight for you like a tiger, that she would fly to your defense in an instant with all the courage in her soul if anyone tried to hurt you? Is this any way to repay her trust and love? Are you ashamed as I am ashamed?  Don't cry, honey, don't cry. But let me warn you, damn your hide, this is Thermopylae and I am standing here. Do you hear me, damn you. I am standing at Thermopylae and the Persians shall not pass! Now get your tail out of here and go wash those dishes, and stop crying!
Is anything wrong?
If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
You don't know where you're going?
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
Your baby?
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
She looks terrible, just awful.
Exactly, and that's why she couldn't possibly have come from such a farm.
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
She's an adult, Mrs. Hillyer, I was merely giving her the facts.
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Well, you run on now.
Oh-hh, ohh-hh, Lord, he's gonna kill me.
Yes, ma'am.
I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
Abe Lincoln...
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.
I can not even begin to imagine how much that must have hurt.
What of it?  Haven't we waited forever... ?  Haven't we, honey?  Haven't we waited long enough to get this scumbag?
You big, fat sonofabitch, if it weren't for me, you'd still be sitting in the file room where I found you.  And you... Nena... you've still got needle scars from where I pulled you out of.  You of all people...
Yeah.
The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
Entertainers don't count.
We're gonna rain on Zimmermann's parade.
I'm not taking a cigarette break, jackass, just give me one!
Birth control's important.
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
Hey... HEY!    Cool down, Jumbo!
I'm waiting till the time's right.
We've got the tape to prove it.
Not like this.  Are you even listening?
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...  "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."
What are you, communist?  At least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them.
All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
I can't believe I'm hearing this,
Dead.
How'd we do?
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
Billy!  Billy!
Well, let me tell you how it is...
Yoda will always be with you.
Yeah, sure.
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
You love him, don't you?
I'm trying!
You, too.
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Tell me.
Your father?
It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
There is no conflict.
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
I told you, my car broke down.
He might be.  I don't know.
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
Well I want to leave.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
You're OK by me.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Goodbye
Want to come again and stay
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
Oh no no no no.
The delivery boy.
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
And our World will do the Time Warp again.
...I'm sorry.
I think mebbe we're early or somethin' --
By accident?
D'you really wanna call?
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Ya puttin' me on, right?
Yes.
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
-- The legs.
Ya right --  Mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty, y'know.
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
...I can't beat him.
Apollo?
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in ya pants, didn't ya!  Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!!
You's the novelty, Champ!
I'll carry him 'till the third.
Get that doctor.
...Thanks.
...Still don't feel no heat.
Where're you off to now?
...Stay in school an' use your brains, dig -- Be a lawyer, be a doctor, carry a leather briefcase an' forget about sports!! Sports can only make ya grunt an' smell -- Be a thinker not a stinker!!
Of wa?
Does that bum have to say that?
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
Bob.
Look, Bob, if ya wanna dance, ya gotta pay the band -- If ya borrow, ya gotta pay the man... Me, I ain't emotionally involved.
Do I have to pay juice?
Did you hear what I said?
...Yeah.
Come July, twenty-five.
Yeah --
Ain't they?
Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.
...Shrewd.
Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
Great, kid, great.
It ain't your locker no more.
Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
What kinda business?
Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.
Maybe ya better forget it.
He's takin' cheap shots.
I'll do okay.
Sure I like her.
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
...It's cold outside, Paulie.
Maybe --
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
Yeah...
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
Not for long.  We're retiring the Red Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they'll have to.  And when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.
Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
He made me laugh.
That's what you woke me up for?
Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
So what do you want me to do?
Stop what?
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
Take it easy.
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
Two bits.
... I'd head for Cucamonga.
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
From this box here...
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Uh? Uh?
Romeo will answer it?
But new struck cuz.
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
No, cuz, I rather weep.
Farewell, my cuz.
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
Welcome.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
A most courteous exposition.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Here's goodly gear!
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
I am for you.
His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague; The only son of your great enemy.
As my American friend Larry would say: are you fucking deaf?  It's under your seat.
Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
I don't know.
I'm up for that...
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
Is that right?
Exactly.  And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me.
Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
Don't do it, Sam!
I think not.  After you...
There's been a slight problem.
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...
Now that is an interesting proposition.
I don't have it with me...
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
So what do we do?
There is one other thing...
Of course.  Don't you?
Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
Not for long.
Everybody.
I don't think so.
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
We live in a singular world, my friend.
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
I'm going with you.
If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
Do what?
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
Very ugly.
You were behind the door?
Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
So I do it.
Finish the job...
And now...
You better get some sleep, alright?
A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
Why don't we step into my office...
Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
I might know where you could get a copy.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
I want to get some hounds down here.
Don't lie to me!!!!
That's what everyone thinks.  But according to him, when it's the real thing, it's quite an intimidatin' environment in which to concentrate.
What do you mean what are we going to do?
All right we will.
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner.
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
Well I mean it this time.  Come on.  Let's get this over with!
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
What do you mean?  Look.  We can make still make it work.
Rock solid.
Denning was wearing a bug.
No.  But he would, probably.
Hi.
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
OK.  I love you.
Nothing happened?
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
I know.
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
What did he buy?
Why would someone do that?
Dwayne.
Lingerie...
I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye won’t immediately look.
All right you’re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Sort of.
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
I don't know...
I didn't say that.  You did.
Well I got the tires rotated, I went shopping, and I made dinner.
Dwayne -
You'd do this to me!
Calm down --
Anything in it?
Money.
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
We're going to find out.
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
I'd like to see you try.
How'd you know?
So tell me what you know.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
El Capitan?
Your friend's ship?  Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work.
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed.
I'm calling for back up!
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
You sound like that all the time.
He'll be back soon.
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
No.  It was my singing.
I don't need a turn!
What's a Chinese heaven?
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
Follow me my Asian brother.
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
Yes.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.
That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
It's my responsibility.
The Secret Service?  Why?
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
Shut up!
Sir, I can explain.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
They asked for the best street man I had.
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
Did you make the plate?!
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
What?
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
Yeah, it's good.
No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  Œscuse me.
It's him.
I am from outa town.
I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
You know him?
Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
I could get promoted right out of here.
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
Not to me. Never to me.
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
Eleven thirty tomorrow the Ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is.  He said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
Let me take you back inside, okay?
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
"Sink the putt."
I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
You're coming here?
Then come for dinner.
Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
Then you'll be my best man.
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
Oh, please!
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
About her upcoming wedding and all.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
A little longer for me.
Me, either.
I love you, too.
I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
Ya think?
No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
But I'm weird.
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
Okay.
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
Is there somebody else?
You don't love me, is that it?
No, that's free.  He's an architect.  Used to do big high-profile projects.  He scaled it all back when his wife died.  Now he remodels people's homes.  He works in a small firm, makes a good living.
Am I what they had in mind?
Nope.
Happy New Year.
We'll stay at the Plaza --
That doesn't make any sense.
Okay, okay.
What?
Well, I did.  And you know what I think? I think that it was almost... too perfect.
It's so beautiful.  It's just what I would have picked out if I'd had every ring in the world to choose from.  You see what I mean.  There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of them.  Surprises are highly overrated.
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
I should say something in this about magic.
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
I always wondered about that too.
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Made for each other.
I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I feel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone about what happened.  "Sleepless in Seattle" is history.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
Howard.
Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
It wasn't a sign.  It was a coincidence.
You know.
The cabinets have to be redone --
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
What's she talking about?
I don't know --
No.
Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
You'll like it.
You think so?
Do you want a fruit plate?
I'd rather die than eat on an airplane.  I'm telling them you're twelve so you can fly unaccompanied and they won't make you be carried around by a stewardess and everything.
What is it?
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
I'm starting to notice that.
Whose show was this on?
Jed's got cables.
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
Is that what she used to sing?
I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
Now I'm late.  Bye.
She's going to cook something for us?
It's only ten o'clock.
This conversation is finished.
Goddammit, I am sick of this --
When I found you?
Okay.
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.
You look good yourself.
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
It never ends.
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
What do you mean -- sex equality?
You know ...  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
An American.
Don't you worry. We'll get some action.
Because if we lose, we lose more than a strike. We lose the union. And the men know this. And if we win, we win more than a few demands. We win...  ... something bigger. Hope. Hope for our kids. Juanito can't grow strong on milk alone.
Can't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time?
Can be what?
No, no ... we wouldn't do it.
That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
No. We can't can't go on this way. We can't go back to the old way either.
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
You mean you're ready to give up?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
What are you saying?
Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
What attitude?
That's it?
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.

I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.
Leave me out of this.
Nothing.
You don't understand.
You get off on abuse or something?
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
That's long enough to get out of town.
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
How much time do you have?
Therapy session is over.
I'm kind of busy.
You always been this stubborn?
I just can't. Okay?
I don't want to.
I don't want to leave you.
Your daughter needs you.  Go.
I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
Sure, Jimmy.
Yes, Jimmy
Hey, check it out...
Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
The good stuff.  Can you handle that?
No, I'm good.
Pull your pants down.
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
Uh-uh-uh ...
Just some buddies.
Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.
Soon. I promise.  We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear.  In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.
Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
To who?
You mean like the Donner Party?
Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
What do you mean?
Here it comes, poor Tom.
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
...alright, let me know when.
Respectfully, sir, sending men all the way up to Ramelle to save one private doesn't make a fucking, goddamned bit of sense.  Sir.
What about the Captain?  Where's he from?
Yep.
Shut up, will you?
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
They don't send planes to put out machine guns.  Two flank runners with surpressing fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!
That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
You think the rest of us were?
It seemed appropriate.
Did he see any sign of them?
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
But, sir...
Goddamn it, sir...
We in radio contact with anybody up there?
That's not what we're here for.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
Nope.
How about you take your position?
About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
Out of the mouth of babes.
Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
Huh?
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
You have orders, too.
Get back to your positions!
Alright, come with me.
Yes, sir.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
Yeah?
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
And your former wife.
I still am.
He's a mess!
I'll be home soon.
Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
That's just so embarrassing.
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
Meaning?
You're an inspiration Lloyd; you should go on the seven hundred club or something.
Wait a minute.
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it.
Oh god, I don't need all these presents.  I don't know any kid who got a car, I mean...
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
Crash paranoia.
Dad, I'm sorry.
You're not listening to me.
Dad, why are you acting this way?  Is this because of the other morning?
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
So you're monumentally busy?
Hmmm....
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
Nobody knew me before tonight.
Yeah.  I'm so glad we did this.
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
Job?  Being a great date.
Or, or I could always wear this one.
Won't you see me later?
Yeah.  With potential.
Friends with potential.
Well no, it's not noble, but it's a good aid to your lesson.
Then why are you shaking?
Why didn't you tell me?
Well, I need to study, and...
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
Yeah, uh-huh.
No I didn't.
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
Okay.
No.
Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
No, really.
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
No way.
What?
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
Yeah.
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
I called her up.
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
Sir, the list is correct.
What -
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
You're kidding.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
I just told you.
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
That's great.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
Things are great, things are great.
I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.
Christmas presents.
It's dangerous.  It's dangerous, to me, personally.
I think it's too late.
Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  Look at them.
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
Would it do any good?
No.
Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together.  What is this?  I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad.  We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.
We're aware of that.
No, he quit - the whole God thing--he has issues. The previews for next week...
I can't believe you're alone in that house.
Hang up...call...
What if I said goodbye?
No, it's me.
Fair enough.
Tons and tons.
And are the police sure about that?
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
She dumped me.
I think it's out of your control.
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
What guy?
Miss Weathers.
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
And Joel's pre-med.
Don't worry...
You're pretty when you're angry.
You're getting obvious.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
Gotta.
Yeah, right.
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
It's documented. Most serial killers are attractive--slightly off white males in their twenties.
I just love being a sister.
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?
You are so not funny.
But your voice sounds so familiar.
No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
Nope.
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
To me Hollywood is about death.
I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
Sid I can see you!
What about me?
It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
Honestly, my life.
Sure.
No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
No really?
There a story in that building?
Possibly.
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to make you all repent for your sins, and now I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye.
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
Who's this?
But you know my favorite name?
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
W-what do you want?
The final act? Well let's play asshole!
WHERE?
Who the fuck is this?
No one's saying you did.
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
And if you get it right -- you die.
That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
She looked dead. Still does.
You rode your bike out there?
Now that it's out of your system.
I'm going... I'm going.
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
It's okay. We need to talk.
But you're right -- enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
Who is this?
They'd never make it in time.
Sure...
Come on. It'll be fun.
I'll even give you a warm up question.
No it's not. It was Jason.
Your call.
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
Can I bring Kenny?
I don't think you're so bad.
Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
At the airport.
Yes, sir.
Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
Has his story changed?
So who are you?
Hello Sidney.
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
Because, obviously they don't watch enough movies. This is standard horror movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited.
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
Are you serious?
No way.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Do they know who did it?
It's past seven.
No, nothing's like it used to be.
I knew this guy was too perfect. He was destined to have a flaw.
But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
And you believe it?
No way.
Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
Greed.  It was written in blood.
It's always been like this.
I'll see you.
David... please...
Spit it out.
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
Oh, don't worry. You won't...
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
No one yet.
You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
Forced what?
It's got to be.
No.
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
The fingerprints.
We'll tag along.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
Him?
You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
We had him.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
Where's the victory?
Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man.
Why don't you shut the fuck up for a while? You bitch and complain... if I thought like you, I would have slit my wrist already.
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
Give me a break.
It's a nice name.  William, I'd like you to meet David.  David... William.
Really?
I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
Crime of passion.
This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
Why don't you finish the job?
That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
I ain't wearing no gun.
Well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'...
Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
I figger a man's only good for one oath at a time...I took mine to the Confederate States of America...  So did you, Reverend...
...like a flower and is cut down... <U>Amen</U>!
You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
Now mount up, son...
Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
Scar! Where's he holed in?
Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
I beg your pardon?
No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.
No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
Think she means for us to follow?
What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
She's been with the bucks! She's nothin' now but a...
You've seen her!...She's alive?
We got two around that age...
Come on, say it.  You know...
Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think?
1976.  What happened back then?
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
Very funny.
Oh
Ah
Sir Robert De Lesseps.
Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
Never!
What is the chief part?
No, no. You have a wife, children
No, your marriage bed.
yet cannot love nor write it.
Who is that?
Who are you?
As soon as I have found my muse
She is always Aphrodite.
Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
No, then.
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
What? Who?
How will it?
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.  Yes, I know.
A different one you haven't written?
Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!
It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master.
I would have made you immortal.  Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
"Oh then, dear saint, let lips do what hands to: They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair."
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; And but thou love me, let them find me here.
Is she obedient?
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
Oh but why "alas?"
Oh--I am him too!
Even your play.
Oh
Oh, but it will end well for love?
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
You cannot marry Wessex!
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
And break her heart and mine?
I … Her letter came to me by the nurse.
Your aunt?
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
You are on my ground.
Serve.
I don't have time.
I'm only asking what you think.
It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
When are you going to let the police know?
And what about you?
Then what? Who's going to do what?
No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
They know.
It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
But more laughter than tears, I think? Yes. On balance? I mean, remember that time when -- oh, we could talk all night, but we have to go. Don't we, Juliet?
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
Well, then?
That's all?
Sorry to waste your time.
What?
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
-- which is a hack.
Now?
I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
What? What's wrong?
I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
It's the only way.
No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.
You mustn't take it so badly.
I see.
You were going to say something.
Can we come in?
Of course.
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
Yes, absolutely.
You're sure of that.
No.
And you need your sleep.
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
What're you talking about, George?
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
I just thought you'd like to know --
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
I don't want to place you in any position --
No, I know.
I know.
That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.
No. You know too many sick ladies.
God, I adore you.
Did you hear me?
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
Yeah.
Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
Yeah -- he doesn't happen to know that we went together, does he?
Can't you do it out here?
Yeah... I mean great.
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
The shrink? Many times.
No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
Did you?
Did I what?
Well, did you or didn't you?
You did, didn't you?
You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
You're a genius.
Jackie, can we --
-- what?
-- oh I thought you were --
-- mmm --
-- ass and legs --
I want to marry you. I want to take care of you and I want your children, and I want you to be my girl. That's all I want. That's all I want out of my life, and it's a lot.
Don't leave me...
What for?
I don't know -- I've got to.
No, man.
-- Oh yeah.
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
-- took a bus.
I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
Here in the canyon.
You said somebody... who?
Now, George --
Fine. How are you?
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
You're different.
I am?
Yeah.
Why am I great?
Hey, I'm, you know --
Okay.
Honey, have they offered you the job?
Who?
-- go ahead.
-- okay --  -- I'll see you later. Your house.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
What do you wanna know for?
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
George, now cut this out.
Yes, yes, I did.
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
No?
Said what!
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
Thank you.
You're right.
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
See she doesn't drink too much.
Well... who are those guys?
I said sit down!
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
What can I say!
Me!
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.

No you won't.
And?
I'm not jealous of the dogs.
Of course not.
Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
You're really a love -- you sure?
We don't think marriage is important.
Honey?
Didn't you have any panties on?
What did you do?
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
Well did he go in there with Jackie?
Thanks for coming by.
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
You mean they ate each other up?
They had to, in order to survive.
Yes?
I'm not supposed to.
Who's Tony?
Room 237?
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Yeah, I know.  It always takes a little time to make new friends.
Okay...oh!
I won't make a sound, I promise. I'll tip-toe.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Red Rum.
Because he hides.
Thank you.
It's okay, really.
Awfully nice of you to say.  Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet.  I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.  So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice.  You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?  You're not to busy, are you?
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
That's swell.  I like you, Lloyd. I always liked you.  You were always the best of them. 
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
Your money's no good here.
Wendy,  let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration.
Yes.
Fine.  Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm?
Yes, I did.
You mean just leave the hotel?
Yes.
Jack...
Wendy, I have let you fuck up my life so far, but I'm not going to let you fuck this up!
I just want to go back to my room.
I'm gonna go now.
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
Royalty?
Oh, I'll say.
How do you do?
Well, that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first.
Sure, Uncle Al.
Brady's a booger and so are you!
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
What's that?
What kind of noises?
And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's-
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable.
We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful.
Save this one for last.
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
I told you!
There! You see!
And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
And you listen to that?
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
Then stop trying to memorize it.  Hit the road.
What?
You can handle this.
I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.
Oh my! 
Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but...  Could you help us?
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
Pay attention...
Like this place?
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
Wet behind the ears.
Babies
What?
That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
Give me a C.  A C!
What?
Would you like that?
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
Your cell.  Your room.
And whom would you call?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?
Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen!
Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
I must go where I can be of use.
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
Think again!  And get out of here.
Screw you!
No nothing.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
Like what?
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
I know, I know.  I'll be careful.  I'll try.
What?
It didn't work, Vince.
No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
Neither did you!
That's what I figured, too.
But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
He's kind.
It's better than ice cream.
We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
I lied.
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up.
Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
What of it?
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Your superiors are two days away!
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
A fine idea.
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
Not for lack of trying.
Believe?
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
No, I couldn't...
I hear nothing.
No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
Did your father take a loan?
Lady Van Tassel.
Tired.
I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
It might have been more.  Might have been positively grand talk.
Yes, he does.  May I try?
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
It was not butchery.
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
Keep climbing.  I will follow...
I... I can't do this.
Let her go!
Yes... yes.  I think I will...
Yes.  Here...
Doctor, he is awake.
This whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon.  But... I am not going to kill you.  Not me...
There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, "Boy this water's cold." Old boy from Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep too."  Get it? That's a goodun.
See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.
Naw, we don't have biscuits.
They was a boy. We made friends.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
Yeah.
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
Don't tell me what to do.
I'll be back in a little bit then.
No sir.
You enjoying yourself, Karl?
Sarcastic right?  You know the boys in the band are probably gonna stay over tonight. We'd be glad to have you.
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
They're from the Dollar Store. I'm not an idiot. Besides we have a garden full of flowers.
I did live there in the state hospital.
They let you out?
How come?
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?
Yeah, I did.
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
I like the way you talk.
I like the way you talk.
Where'd you get them flowers?
They ort to. You're a good boy.
Oh, jackin' off?
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
So it died when it come out?
A little ol' boy.
I reckon.
Is that right?
If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye.
Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken leg.
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
I ain't got no boy.
You better go get 'em.
I'll be.
Tolerable, I reckon.
Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle. Frank, why don't you and Karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin'. Vaughan, you ready to go?
Right now?
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
What brings you back?
Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
An invitation?
And what are you, his chaperone?
Actually, I'm his father.
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
Thanks. I knew you'd understand.
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
Anything good?
Ready. Any time you are.
Okay.  So this is the story of how it happened.  Okay.  It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial.  A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first....
Yeah, probably.
I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
Eighteen and a half years.
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
It means "happiness."
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
Yeah, like what?
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
No you're not.
For keeps?
Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?
Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you'll grow up and become a great man like me. 
No, it's five thousand dollars.
Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.
What can I do for you?
How the hell did you get into the building?
You mean Rashid?
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
I just want to know where he is.
I shouldn't have let him go.
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
It'll cost you five bucks.
Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
Benefits?
Well what?
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
Drawing's a good thing.
Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
Thanks. 
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
Don't worry about it. You've got friends now, remember? Just behave yourself, and everything will work out.
I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
Fries?
Lettuce and tomato?
Oh, yeh?
You scraped the dried blood from the <u>butt</u> of the gaff.  Where a fella's <u>hand</u> goes.  And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...?
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
It is.
You done your math right.
It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
No sense to have <u>any</u> at all., even the right size.  It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car.  Nobody does.
Closer to eight.
So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
Why not?
The Japs did it.
I did.  But the jury won't s...
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.
My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
You're right.  I better use two.
He hit his head.  On the way in.
Well, anything coulda caused that.
Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.
Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
I think you like learning.
That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
I want you.  To tell the truth.
You have to wonder.
Possible.  But not darn likely.
As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that.
Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same.
If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
I wouldn't say encouraged.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
That's the way I like 'em - big and sassy.  And get rid of your roommate.
Funny?  In what way?
Fresh!
Those two musicians from the garage!
Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
As far away as possible.
Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
I'm Josephine.  Sax.
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
We would be caught dead with men.  Those rough, hairy beasts with eight hands -  They all want just one thing from a girl.
I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
And where's he going to be?
That's right.
Oh, no!  Not tonight, Josephine!
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
I'm engaged.
Security.
What?
Get me Room 414.
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
I'll say.
If there's anything I can do for you -
Stay as long as you'd like.
And you've got cold feet.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
No fair guessing.
I'm just going to get some ice.
You're so flat-chested.  Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
What's with him - he drinks?
Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
Who?
Yes, Osgood?
Come one!
You ain't going nowhere.
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
What kind of band is this, anyway?
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
I play the ukulele.  And I sing too.
That so?
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
What's in Florida?
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
So do I.  But don't worry - we'll be seeing a lot of each other.
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
I don't think so.
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -
Up, up, up.
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
You collect shells?
It's been delightful meeting you both.
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
Three?
Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.
Bon voyage.
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
Oh, no!
What else is there for me? 
What is it?
Let's make it an even million.
From a rich millionaire.
I'm afraid not.  I can't make it tonight.
What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present.
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
I come to the old lady's funeral.
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
Big joke!
Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
That's an opera, you ignoramus.
Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
And who runs it?
Well, we all got to go sometime.
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Don’t worry about it.
So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
Sure, disappear. We’ve been walking away our whole lives.
Or Kat....
And she wonders why I swim to the bottom of a Lemondrop every time I see her.
Your probably best off pretending you’re asleep.
Jeffrey told her last night.
Why, with you.
Why should this be any different?  Besides, I have to initiate Nick into the family.
Yeah, kind of.
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
Lasik surgeon, actually.
Maybe not her least... There’s always--
Kat, we must talk. This guy, there’s something not quite right.
Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
I’m compulsive and weird?
I’m desperate to start but I don’t have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I can’t get enough of.
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
A weekend?
A wedding.
I have a friend at the magazine.
What?!
So, why’d you say yes to me?
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
Let me see it...
I don't live far from here. You and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we'll talk about how to get you back home.
That's right--
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!
And so you did your job, right?
Means you keep me using my head, and that's good!
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
Now look, Rita, I don't make the rules -- you puttin' yourself on a limb, comin' here, askin' me to do a thing like this. And I be damn if I'm going to jeopardize my job because you are in love with a little colored boy!
It was too dark, Daddy.
Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
Hi to you, son...
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
Great, son -- not like wakin' up in jail. For a minute or two, didn't quite know where I was, but when I saw your face lookin down on me, made me know right away the day was gonna be a good one, and it all belonged to me!
Sunday...
David!
Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
Yes, ma'm...
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
Maybe soon--
The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard.
Is that a blessing, Reverend?
Will they give him a trial?
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass! This whole thing has gone too far!
I saw him last night!
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes.
You bet your fucking ass it was!
Oh.
What?
I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire and now he's all pissed off!!  AGH! I can't say pissed off?!  AGH!!
God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.
I know what it is!
Something big, children.
Baba mama!
Uhh... I don't know.
FREEZE!!
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
Kay.
No, I mean WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT YOU - we don't know where the hell we are!!
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
Yeah!
How do we do that?
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
She's Not! But if she WAS it would be THAT little asshole who's fucking it up for me!
Okay...
Wow!
Yeah, so what do we say?
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
Yes ma'am!
No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
Hello, Brooke Shields!
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!
<b>Hey, guy, relax, put out! You gotta relax, shut your mouth- Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time-</b>
And the butfor?
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
10-4 good buddy.
The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!
That's clear.
This is my second commercial flight.  I used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast.
Really?
Fat chance of that.  Even if we had C4 and a laser torch these doors wouldn't budge.  That son of a bitch...that stupid son of a bitch.
Close every door behind you!
One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
There's only room on that pod for seven.  That's you and the others.  I'm counting on you to get them out of there.
I can't!
Hopefully sooner than later.
Marry you?
That is one of my priorities.
Send it back if you don't want it.
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
A bowler.
Find your bowler?
What do you want with old man Faz?
Are you guys bruddas?
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
Oh, a professional man. What'll you have?
Wish me luck.
My mom was there. She told me about it. The 'Fazeli Split.'
Who gave it to you?
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
Don't say that about my mom!
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
You shouldn't touch her.
Junior.
He's earned an early retirement.  But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future.  I wanna show you something.
What ever happened to just bowling?
He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
She ran away to be with that...  that Motocross champion.
Line up where you want it.
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
I'm a bowler.
Where can I find him?
Mine, and they never tip.
What do you want with my dad?
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Where did your brother escape from?
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
Not while I'm in training.
No. Not at the present.
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
No, I'm fascinated.
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
...lane six. Yes.
Tell me what happened Theo.
I didn't stop to take his pulse.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz.
Breeze, give him his ball back!
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
Wait a minute --
Any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up?
How about I just press the button?
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
Two and a half days?
What if it attacks?
Thirty yards.
What team?
Storm?  What storm?
Then why am I here?
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
It's impossible.
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
I don't know.  But it's something alien.
What do you mean, he's missing?
He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
-- and then brought her down here --
What am I -- a dog, now?
Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions.
Nothing, sir.
Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
Yes, Harry.
She's not gonna know, sir.
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
I am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named Jerry.
Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
That's quite a secret.
Wait -- down where?
Yeah, it was awful.
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
What are they?
Eggs.
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
The refridgerator.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
You don't believe me.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
What?
Page 87.  "I could never read that far."
Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, "Stop calling me Jerry".  And --
You think, in the sphere --
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
A synthetic opium analogue.
Three to six hours.
Only lab rats.  Here.
For what?
Not believing you.
I did do that, didn't I?
You know what I mean.
Don't you?
No, he isn't.
And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
That's bullshit.
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
Shut up, Beth --
"It's not me, Beth.  It's not me.  It can't be.  I'm not doing anything." Just like Harry said before I stabbed him with the needle.
You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
It's not safe for you to be either.
Get away from the door, Beth.
I'm not fucking with you, Norman. You've fucked yourself.
Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
Leave me alone, Norman.
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
Get away --
A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood right there --
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.
I'm fine.
Look, would you --
Our present.
Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
You don't remember that?
I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine.  Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic.
Beth left?
You didn't say that about the food?
How do we decode it?
Don't have to.  Watch.  It'll do it for you.
The three of us.
I heard!  I heard!
Her legs are in the way.
You got her?
No idea.
Well, press something!
Wait!
Nine hundred feet to surface.
Look closely.  That isn't writing. Those are grooves.
It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.
They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
What was that, sir?
About the time paradox.  How we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive --
What report?
Who's everyone?
Like what?
Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
Was it a military crash?
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
This isn't a game, you know.
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
You're lucky those Tuskens didn't boil you before they hung you out to dry.  They're not the friendly sort. You'd best be moving on before they come back.
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
You mean I generate an energy field?
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm not going alone!
Yes, sir.
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
It's automatic.
You don't believe in the Force?
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
Why didn't you say so before.
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
Your father's dead.  Don't ever forget who's taking care of you, giving you food, giving you shelter, and giving you the allowance in the first place. If you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here, you won't last very long.  I don't want another word.  Finish your dinner, then finish cleaning those 'droids.'
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
Death to all bugs !
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
It looks like an... asteroid.
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
You're upset, that's alright.
I thought you were going to help Carl.
Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here.
Thank you, ma'am.
He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
No way, ma'am !
Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
Hut... hut !
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
Keep trying, Sergeant.
I wouldn't mind.
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
Not a problem.
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
What's going on, Diz ?
Give'em hell, sir !
KIRK UNIT! DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION!
That is how V'ger will survive.
Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
Yes.
Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
You saved the ship.
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.
The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
No!
V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension; V'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the Creator.
Viewer ahead, sir.
That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
I want him here.  Sit down!
... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
High mag, Mr. Sulu!
Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
Why aren't you on board?
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
Helm ready, sir.
Tractor beam remains constant...
I'm goin off-shift.  Come on...I'll walk you home.
It's about life.
It was either that, or a sardine.
Of course.
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
Goodbye.
Mmm.
I love your script.
Me?
They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.
What are you doing down there?
You got a paperclip?
Better idea...
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
Later on.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
Go you Huskies!
She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
...yes.
Hi.
Yep.  N'it's for sale.  One of the few things money can buy.
I'd love to.
Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans...
You know what else a man can do?
Sleep well?
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
What I am <u>saying</u>, is, we have to Look Out For Our Own...Now:  they want to close down Main Street...
Where have you been...
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?
It's all over between us.  I've found someone else.
Who is this person that you've found?
No.  Don't tell me that.
What?
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
They know what her tits look like.
Wat...
Whatever it is.  GO <u>do</u> it.  How you doing on the permit?
And I need a drink.
Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
And a <u>fantasy</u> object...
What'll I do for fun?
Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
<u>Bobby</u>...
I've always seen that.
Well.  What seems to be the...?
Could I see it please...?
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
It's night.
We know that you weren't.
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
I like you, too.
But not that <u>way</u>...
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
Yeah.
Is...Is the Movie!
I...I...
...wants a piece...
Yes.
Find out when Marty Rossen's arriving, get him a bunch of lilacs to send to the broad.
This young woman.
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
My wife's going to have a baby.
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
Who's White...?
Sure.
Did you, where are we going tonight...?
I...?
I...
Um, no.
Why?
I hurt my finger.
...she keeps her back to the camera...?
I'm gonna nail it.
How was your flight?
I'm gonna' bring it off.
That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
Waal, then, you know, you do whatever would make you happy.  Sher.  This is your party, and whatever...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
It takes all kinds.
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
I don't <u>want</u> to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter <u>how</u> much I like chocolate.  I want to be a stud.
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...
During sex.
Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!
She is but an arriviste.
Not with my mouth open.
Nothing sweetheart.
I'm not.
Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.
You owe me a quarter.
YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
There's worse things.
Cos she loves you.
Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
What honey?
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
I have cancer.  Do you know what that is?
Oh.
I helped.
Half.  Of him.
No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.
Let's take our best shot.
Have you still never told him?
Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
Not to me.
Don't do this.
It's a huge moment in their life --
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
Get out!
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
I didn't do it for you.  Believe me.
She was angry at herself.
When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you...
You're not dying.
Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
And you said...
You mean, after I'm dead?
Feeling the pressure?
Who in the world <u>is</u> he?
And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.
Neutral ground.  What's up?
No, there isn't.
Maybe I was wrong on that one.
I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.
He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...
We have the kids.  Next weekend.
Rache, it may take time.
I know that.
Well, they will be.
No, she threw you out.  What a difficult woman.
Don't ever say that.
Oh, yeah?
Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
I'll be your guest!
Nice to have you here.
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
Who is Jesus?
My baby.
My grandchild-baby.
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
He wasn't.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
Oh. What happens now?
You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.
I'm going in there.
Yeah?
Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
You're welcome.  Dad?…Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
OK. Stay there. I'll be right back.
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
Say, Ni...
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Yeah.
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
Oh, I don't remember that...
Great. How old are they?
Wow, that really is great. In a few years, who knows, maybe they'll want to be in my documentary!
How'd you get it?
I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.
He did?
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Times up!
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
We're outta here--
You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
What's that supposed to mean?
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
Where does it lead?
You're going to pay for this...
She's still alive.
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.
We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.
I say we head out.
I have your word, Mister President?
I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
Give that back to me.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki- Tavi.  R...T...T...There's only three combinations of -- T...T...R, or T...R...T...
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
Didn't they tell you?
He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
That's government property, Major.
Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
Thank you, sir.  But what shall I tell them to do if they are denied entrance?
This is General Ripper speaking.
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
No, sir.
You're right, sir.
Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
I know that, sir.
You're damned right they are.
Just a squirt.
To peace on earth.
You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
Yes, sir.  But so do we.
But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country, Major.
Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
Major, you're talking like one of them!
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
How long will it take to receive them all?
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
He says they've only shot down three planes.
General, stick to the point, please.
Can't help it.  What's the wind like?
Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
Call them every five miles.
Thirty-five, still straight.
Maximum ECM!
Sure, I'll take her up right now.
I just got another blast on the CRM-114, and the damned thing decodes: Wing Attack, Plan-R.
Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry.
No kidding.
Master Kong.
What do you mean?
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
Like hell it does.
Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.
There's no other way, boys.  I'm going to have to take her in...the hard way.
Can I have some?
How long were you in there?
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Mm-hm.
You know, like, like, I would always think, uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn't any right move. You know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same TV. Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. "Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?" And see, that's what makes me freak. Because I can do anything I want, as long as I don't care about the result.
Yes.
Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
Do you wanna go to the van?
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
No, he's not with a girl.
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
Huh? No, alright. Well, you know what we need? A hot cop of coffee. Hand on. Ohh, hey, I was up all night too, man. A long, long, long night.
Good.
Sure.
No, no.
Oh, and guess who showed up.
Tim...
Pony, what would you say our relationship is?
Alright, Pony!
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
I will.
This is private property, my friend.
Glad it's okay.
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
I just started it.
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
Okay.
Okay. We'll go for a ride.
Hi.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
Yes.
He is.
A Porsche.
Mm.
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
It's nice to do a lot of things.
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
I'd love to read that.
Hi, I'm Erica.
It does look good.
He causes problems. He was here earlier.
Who were you talking to?
What?
Well, w-what happened?
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
You don't know?
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
Well, then, there now, why don't you go inside and call the cops and I'll come in there and blow your fucking brains out.
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
Yes.
Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
No one does nothing, Jeff.
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
God, you smell like whiskey.
Wait. What, what are you saying?
You did, huh? Good for you.
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
Yeah, they could be songs.
Yeah, really.
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
Why don't you come with us, man? I mean, I want to hear about those songs you've been working on. You too, Buff.
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
Like?
Yeah?
And you know why it's so good? See, because, see, you guys are real. No, man, I mean it. You guys have a sense of humor. You live your lives, you know. It's simple, you know. The guys on the road, I mean, the band, all they talk about is scoring chicks... and Danny, all Danny talks about is money.
You done?
I'm moving.
Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.
"I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how"
It's none of my business?
Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
Come on, Jeff.
Jeff!
Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.
Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
I personally think of how Conan started as a writer, then became a...
Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.
Well...
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
I sure do.
Oh, Jack...
Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins.  Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these.
We're here for you, Diane.
And if the O.J. trial taught us anything, it taught us that in America, you can cut off someone's head and still be found innocent if you have enough money.  Your mom only shot a guy...
Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
Fern!  C'mere!  She's siphoning tanks - takes a sec to cap off the cyanide hose.
I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...
That's okay, Hannah.  It was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies.  Sex - you can learn from movies.  But robberies?  There's no way.
'Cause I will Jerry Springer you faster than you can say "Fat-assed lesbian!"
Your help.
Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
I didn't mean to --
Action! The scene starts.
Let it ride for a while.
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
What teacher?
I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
What has Artie to do with it.
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
You're tough, all right.
And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
Gordon Cole... Look, Norma, I'm in the middle of a rehearsal.  Make yourself comfortable.
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
Sure.  Wait a minute -- haven't I seen you -- ?
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
You are! Writing words, words! You've made a rope of words and strangled this businessl But there is a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles, and Technicolor to photograph the red, swollen tongue!
Yeah?
Fair enough.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
Now you're being silly.  We don't need two cars.  We have a car.  And not one of thuse cheap new things made of chromium and spit.  An Isotta-Fraschini.  Have you ever heard of Isotta-Fraschinis?  All hand-made.  Cost me twenty-eight thousand dollars.
What's wrong with It?

I understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the Metropolitan and sat there listening to La Traviata, all by himself.  He was afraid of catching cold.
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
You're a darling.
It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
Good night.
Of course you haven't.  I wouldn't let you.
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
Wanted what?
That isn't true! Max?
Dressed for what?
Madame is waiting.
They found your car in the garage.  They are going to tow it away.
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
No, that was me.  I said, Who wants to see a Civil War picture?
You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
Gillis, get this through your head.  I'm not just your agent. It's not the ten per cent.  I'm your friend.
Yes.  Madame.
Paramount studios.
They have?  Thank you, Max.  Tell Mr. DeMille I will be on the set at once.
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
Have fun.
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
Am I? Still?
Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
Western Europe.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
Later.
When can I see, you again ?
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
You don't like me? You hate me?
No.
Terrific.
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
Just like that?
I don't see why not.
She has hostages.
How do I fight it?
I'll mention it upstairs.
I bet they do.
And you think you're in love.
I could force you.
You vicious--
Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
Yes.
Oh, sure.
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
Why didn't you tell me?
Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this.
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
Must've been a defective puck.
She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.
Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.
Cigarette?
I could teach you a thing or two now.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
Are you happy, Zaltar?
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
Better than when I was a child.
There's no vodka in it.
The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
Oh...I came close once.
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
Me neither...
Kent!
Mmmmm . . .
What are you doing?
Kitchen. . . Technician
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
So where is all them half-centses?
One.  And a half.
Yeah. A raise . .
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
Everything.
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
We gonna crash?
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
I didn't have my camera with me.
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
You just did, with that great dinner.
And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
Turn on the light.
Superman. The boy you left behind.
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
Missing????
Blizzards! Heat waves!
Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Maybe I could try --
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
Superman? Oh, was he here?
And you weren't. As usual. What do you say to that?
Oh come on, that's ridic -
Say you love me.
I know that, Lois. And I wish he were here . . .
You're not selfish at all.
Oh, when it comes to you I am. Not that I don't understand why they all need you. but they can't need you more than I do.
Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
Everything on it.
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
Dickens! The whole world's about to blow up and you're reading Dickens?!
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
My kind of people.
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.
He has powers as we do . . .
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
Australia.
Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home.  Until now.

"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
That's just it! You don't have to flaunt it. You're no slave to fashion ... although ...
Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
Clark. . . !
I'm not so sure you do.
Absolutely!
Who?
Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. It's like you come from two different worlds.
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
Silly me. How do I ever think I can fool the super guy. You're right, no bomb. I just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call.  I confess . . . I tricked you. Hey, you look great!
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
I take the man out of Argentina - and it was no picnic finding him y'know? And what does he think about? Bunkers. Still living in the past, when I am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world!
Nobody else.
Thank you.
Albert!
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
I know you're a good boy, Clark. No mother could ask for better. It's just that...
Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
I know.
He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.
Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
Don't you ever give up?
Jealous? Of what?
Okay.  Take me to your leader.
I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
Is that an innuendo, Miss Teschmacher? Because if it is, you are about to experience the heady thrill of being hurled from a moving vehicle.
But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --
You?! How about me?
I knew you'd hit me.
He always shows up when somebody's in danger.
What's your name, boy?
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
-- as we will be.
Well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.
Wha'...what are you doing here?
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Do you like pink?
Very much.
I gave him this new face.
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
Then...when did she get better?
Yes.  Do you find there's something strange about this meat?
Nothing.  We made it to the hospital.  I didn't have to go as far as I was prepared to.  But I was prepared to go all the way.
I understand.
Why are you telling me this?
I'm not sure.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
No.  It should be dry by now.
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
Berries.
Yes.  Like I was putting them into my big basket.  Clearing the hillside of its children.
Were his parents...attentive to him?
That would complicate things.
Yes.  He does.
Mrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.
Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
You hate it.
We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
It's interesting.
Did he say what about?
Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left.
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
Unless the report from the National Weather Bureau for the district on January 23 goes into the record, I will object to that question.
Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
And what was the weather like at this time?
Indian?
Here we go.
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
Yes.
Yes.
Do you have the blood test?
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
Please.
Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
Positive.
Yes.
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
You remember this?
Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm telling it.
Nothing.
Pretty slick, eh?
It's okay.
Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
But you didn't lose me.
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
That's the horse!  Shotgun - Shotgun in the fifth!
We're on our way there now...
Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
Give me a chance --
Hurry back.
Well, just be careful you don't knock her down, huh?
No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
Wait a minute, I haven't handed over punishing privileges to you YET!  Put the whip down and I might respect what you're saying...
Son, you raise your voice again and you'll be outa here on your golden pratt!
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
I'm taking up the situation with you now...
Susie, I want to help you--, there's nothing I won't do for you. You're all I've got in the whole, wide world.
A man couldn't ask for a squarer shake.  Let me have Billy Van Cleve...  Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how I'm tied to your apron strings...  Billy!  J.J.!  What's this about that boy?  What boy?  Where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? You're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!...  No, don't explain your point of view, but...
Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
Why does everything you say sound like a threat?
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
A pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match!  It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's "integrity".
Don't go wild, Sidney.
...And he's got them on him.  I appreciate a thing like that - I appreciate where you are looking out for the virtue of the city.
Dallas?  Could be.  He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...
We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house?
But, Sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning!
Help me with two minutes of silence!
Take a top coat.
Yes.
Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya?  How do you like it?  He comes to my office and -
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
Good!  We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the- Portisan.
What ship?
I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have these two children?  You don't need us.  Your heart and your mind are in here.  But it doesn't love you like we do.
I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it.
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
Max.
Right.
Chill out, dickwad.
No.
No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
Remember what I said, you can't...
I have to go away, John.
Gimme that Phillips right there.
Where'd you learn all this stuff?
Alright, it!  We need it!
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
Uh huh.
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
On all what?
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
Respect your elders and your betters!
I'm very sorry.
So, what does the Russki want?
It's a bet. You're the witness, Emmi.
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
You bet.
With more what? More what?
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
No can do.
Then you're going to kill me.
Yes.
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.
Of course.
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
Sure.
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
You didn't complain about the racial policies, just about the musical standards, is that right?
Who?
What telegram?
Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
Tell me about von der Null.
Von der Null?
I have no idea.
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
Of course I know what that is.
Excuse me. Did you know that he refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler was present in the audience?
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
Yeah?
Yes, Dr. Furtwängler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
Yes.
Nope.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Alright!
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
Great.
You're a big help.
Come here.
Kyle.
Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
You'll learn.
You like it?  It's my first.
I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...
You must have had a fun child-
Hot dogs?
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
We did it, Kyle.  We got it.
Yes.
They've already been identi- fied.  There's no doubt.
Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
Like shit, boss.
My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
Did you?  Kudos.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
How thoughtful.  The gift of inconvenience.
It's much easier this way.  Come on, step up...
Consumer Recreation Services.  It's their building.  They...
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
You're the one who started running.
Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
Nicholas Van Orton?  What are you, a czar?
Why... ?
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
Keep it.
Can we talk?
It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  You're saying it's not you?
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
Get out.
They did the same to him as they did to you.
I didn't say anything.
It might be best if we didn't talk.
Scams, con games.  How many?
It's mine...
Guess you missed it.
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
Stop talking...
Shut up!
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
Claire.  Pleased to meet you.
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
Originally, Connecticut.
Boyfriend?
Always.
So do you.  And to think I was worried...
About me?
Never better.
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
It's a profound life experience.
Do it for YOU.
What's this all about, Connie?
Who?
You dodged a bullet.
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Yes.
Yes.
Of course, Nick...
Yes.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
It's different every time.
Humor me with specifics.
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing.  Second, you don't have to decide today.  Take the silly tests, fill out the forms.  One day, the game begins.  You either love it or hate it.  Decide then.  We're like an experimental Book-of-the-Month- Club; drop out at any time with no further obligation.  That was my sales pitch.
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
Is there a room key?
No, you didn't...
Ilsa... you're alright?
Did you worry about him?
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Cancel lunch.  Make reservations at Campton Place for me and Mr. Butts.
That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
You know you can.
It's what they do.  It's like... being toyed with by a bunch of...  Depraved children.
Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
Sure.
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
-- how much is this car worth?
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
That smell... oh, God.
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
Like she smelled it too?
I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her.
How'd I know it was for you?
Who?
-- no one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.  No one will come any nearer than that.  In the night.  In the dark.
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
Then what good is he?
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
What kind of food?
Oh, god.
Who?
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
Because --
Where do we go?
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
That's why I'm letting you take care of this.  I'm the one with appearances to maintain.  But who gives a shit about you?  Not even God.
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
Our black friends?
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
Been to the Boat Show.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
Huh?
What?
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
Probably.
Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.
Hell, no.  I started writing.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
What was that, then?
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
Now who's being sarcastic?
I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went.  It must've been the bars.
How'd you manage that, then.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
-- Mr. Lindgren.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
Are you serious.
Get seven years, did you?
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
Stick with me, kid.  Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes.
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
Black market during the war.
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
How far?
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
So what's your beef, pal?
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
Where is he now?
Could do, yeah.
Hey.
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
That don't mean nothin'.
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
Something's on.
While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
I doubt it.
Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
Susan.
Oh, I think a shake-up was in order. Definitely.  Otherwise, people get lazy, don't they?  Forgetful.  Start thinking they can get away with things.  Gotta shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay attention.
Be seein' you.
Tell me.
At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
He didn't say that.
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
Ah... it's nothing.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
You're an enthusiast.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
Did she make mistakes?
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
Yeah.
Cash.
It's OK.
And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
How's business, Dave?
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
Uh-huh.
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
Told what?
How's that?
So?
You don't have to tell me anything.
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
*I* was with her.
He and Doris... were having an affair.
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
Sure you don't need one?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Sure, go to the store. Go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed...
Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.
What the--
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
Birdy...
Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam? People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth...
Homicide.
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
No.
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
Do they have to wear uniforms?
What's the combination?
Let's go!
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
Night watchman who found the body. Sweet old man.  Been tossing his cookies for over an hour.  Not a likely suspect.
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
The sub-basement?
I've been down there.  It links up to the old sewer system.  I can guide you out.
I hope you liked it.
Lovely bouquet.  After our last case, Vince took me out for a draft beer. As I recall we split the check.
Right.  The entire brain appears to have been extracted.  May I see it, please?
We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
Let me see the plant press.
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
Don't stop now.
They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
Yes.  John made quite a study of the whole museum.  He had a copy of my original plans.
I don't believe it.
Footsteps!
Big as a house.
Margo, you haven't heard?
So what?
How about lunch?
How did you know that?
I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
How?
The answer's right in front of us.
Oh God!  Help!
That thing is John Whittlesley.  I should have seen it before!  The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA!  He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states.  He probably entered the country as a man.  It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how he got from the boat to the museum!
Today.
Why wouldn't I?
You want to book the flight?
He was tidying up his garbage.  I was going to call you.  But half-way through, he gave up and fell asleep.
All prop cars accounted for?
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
It has to be the reality.
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
Shhh!
Outta my job, outta Seahaven, off this island...<i>out!</i>
--Truman, what are you doing here?
I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
I've been thinking--
How do you know?
I'm not hungry.
See you in a minute, sweetheart.
What's the hurry?
I don't know--
--we need more charcoal.
You got it.
Well, thank you for your help.
There's no one here.
You're not FBI agents.
When was that?
Me?
They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  Maybe a small roadside memorial.
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
No. Just fossils, far as I know.
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data -- if you ignore it as we have done -- the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost --
Oh yeah. Had you big time.
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
Something sweet.
I'm in the vending room.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
Get dressed, Scully.
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
This is great. This is fitting.
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
On whose orders?
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
I want to know where Scully is.
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
I do it all the time!
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
Peter, okay?
You're the shrink, you tell me.
's broken.
Already there.
That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
Das worren nooh zeiten.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
I was told there were only two men there.
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
Yes. He moved his head, but the rest is good, isn't it?
Tell me more.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
We're both in it, Harry.
What's the matter?
Why?
Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
I shall be all right.
We loved each other, do you mean that?
What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
That's what we want to find out.
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
They'll be returned, miss.
They are - private - letters.
Good-bye.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
Where?
This is forgery. It is very clever.
Martins.
Schmolka!
When did you see him last?
Holly Martins.
It wasn't petrol.
Thank you. Excuse me.
Well?...
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
She's right. It's none of my business.
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
This way, miss.
You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
Heard of Harry Lime?
Goodness, that's awkward.
It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
Listen...
Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
I told the police.
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
What did you expect me to be - part of your...
Coming to the point, please.
You remember me? Upstairs...
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
The Roumanian?
No, no. He came late after they carried him to the Joseph Statue.
Joseph Harbin.
Joseph Harbin? No...no.
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
Okay.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
What!
A fin!
I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
Swim?
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
What??
Who the fuck are you?
Yes.
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
Billings, if Hitler didn't kill six million, why is he your hero?... Concentration camps all over Europe, and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand.... He's a putz.
The mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters. They thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there, with secret, alternative meanings.
Are they still together?
Bigger and better.
It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...
What's it about?
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
No. What are you looking for?
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
And be crushed.
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
No, but deep down, beneath the "tolerance" they learn on television, nothing's changed. The very word makes their skin crawl.  It isn't even hate, really. It's more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor. We want to step on it. Crush it. We don't even know why. It's a physical reaction. Everyone feels it.
They're liars and cowards.
What's that?  Okay. Surprise us...
Danny, what about the Jews?
And? WHat did you notice?
Look at me.  DO I look Jewish?  Look...
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
I can't say that.
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
So what Jew would you kill first?
Fine.
What is happening?
Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
Steve's going to explain it.
I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes.  He doesn't want me around.
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
<i>New York Times</i>...?
It will.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
JTS...?
You want to kill a Jew. I already did.
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
Dennis Leary.
And let us say...
What do you mean?
Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
And so, on this, the most solemn day of the Jewish year, a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that --
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
Johana, am I boring you?
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
Hello!
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
Don't you agree, Jacques?
Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
What else is there?
Why?
How many are, down there?
It isn't lit yet.
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?
People say that?
Well... about everything.
As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
What is it?
So what!?  His job is to hand out the paychecks.  And he does that very well, let me tell you.
I don't want to erase anything.
... I was right about what?
... It is much better down there. It's a better place.
I don't know... why?
Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it.  It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous?
Thank you...
Give it to me.
You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!
... The way she moves.
Aren't you happy?  Don't you feel proud...?  I feel proud and all I did was watch.
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
No... tell me.
I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.
No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand me a glass of water?
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
Ah?!
Of course, that's what they're for.
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
That'll work. Get them out to the Jewish community stat. We got an epidemic on our hands.
It's Esther.
He works too much. God forbid he should have a nice Jewish girl come eat by him once in a while. Take his mind off his work. Maybe a blowjob here and there.
He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.
Afterwards they'll make the decision as to whether or not they'd like to continue their religious studies in Israel. Because, hey, after all we'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism.
Kiss me you Semitic stud!
So don't show a picture.
Happy Hanukkah Morty.
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
No, he wasn't kidding. I'm sick. Claw women? Hurt little girls? No!
What arroyo -— how did you get to it ——
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
What are you doing that for?
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
I'll take you about. Got some nice things.
I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
Various reasons.  But I can't see why you'd be interested in the rather dusty career of William Galbraith — teacher, naturalist, curator -- when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself.
I know all that, chief, and I don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else --
On his back, I suppose.
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
No —- not yet.
Get it out of here!
And not a sign of the leopard?
If that's being a softie -- there are two of us.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
You a tourist?
When will they be back?
I work here, sir. I’m here most of the time.
That depends what you’re looking at.
Well, Leon does not need money for prints, Mr Lombard. Does his own printing. Wouldn’t want anyone to interfere with his ‘Art’!  Which, as he subsequently vanished, raises the question: what was the money for? Perish the thought.
I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning?
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
Perhaps I should come back when you’re...
No. You’re fired! Get out of my house. And take your sick tape with you...
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
Who is Friedman?
Huh! Really? Hotels?
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. I’ll give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
Why don’t you ask when I left the Mondrian?
I’ve had a long and unpleasant day. I’m tired and I’m angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leon’s boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why haven’t you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
Leon hung himself.
Adonis thought your brother’s body’d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn’t he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Leon hung himself...
Leon’s not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leon’s found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned I’d exceeded his expectations.
Leon didn’t hang himself, Deborah. Your husband killed him and made his death look like suicide. How did he do it, eh? Strangulation? Drugs? No doubt an autopsy will tell.
Leon could still have hung himself.
Is there anything to understand?
You bastard...
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child supplier’s being tailed?
Should I?
Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. That’s when he hit me, and told me he’d killed my brother... “You don’t know what you’ve done,” he said.  “We’re in deep trouble,” he said. “We,” he said. “We.”  We’d both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
What do you suggest?
Your parents arranged the visit to my office?
You wouldn’t understand.
Yeah.
No. A poor little rich boy who thought he’d save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
How come you’re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. There’s a dirt track with a ‘Closed to the public’ sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you haven’t heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
Who’s the guy? Who’s the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate I’d have had to kill him.
Do you know a friendly cop?
Then find another way.
Yeah.
Yes... Good, good...
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. He’s got a safe...  I need a doctor...
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, I’ve got to get to...
Where is it?
Good.
It’s Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, that’s what they do to their employees, isn’t it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining people’s lives. Thanks for the lift!
Thank you, Jane.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
I presume you checked your son’s apartment...
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
Is my money in there?
Uh-huh. You could’ve waited for me inside.
I don’t know what your problem is, but...
Right now your big friend at the Diplomat is bleeding fast, Martin. He might still possibly survive if attended to soon. And he did cooperate.
Maybe I don’t.
Hyatt... Friedman’s... at the Hyatt...
Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He...
I’m sorry. It’s just you don’t look local...
He’d come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... ‘Sleeping Beauty’. The Disney film...  Well, it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldn’t watch...
He... Apparently the hostility was all hers. Leon didn’t... It hurt him. They used to be close...  Their parents were in their forties when they were born, you see. And mostly away. They grew up in a Scottish mansion with old nannies and servants. He... “Our world was so old and cold, we shone for one another,” Leon used to say. His sister cut him off after she got married. He never understood why but thought it was because she had no children. Was bitter...
... No.
... No. In fact, I’d seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasn’t getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
Three days and that’s three days too many.Come on. Get your ass up.
Los Angeles?
Excuse me?
No shit... Well, I’m afraid I can’t help you.
Eh bien... T’es sûr que t’as besoin de moi?  La petite m’a l’air assez bien foutue, non?
That’s the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what you’re up to, eh, French-fuck?
That’s what he said...
Don’t tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
So... pretend it's not a game.
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
Do you think I could have some water?
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
That's an order!
You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and...
I'm staying, Jean.
But that was her order!
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?
And?
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she...
We want her burned as a witch!
God defeated the English, not me.
In a village called Domremy.
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
You have nothing to regret...
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
I'm... I'm not the king...
I know you're not yet -- but you will be, soon.
I didn't wait long.  One day I was going to Mass, like I do every day, when the same strange wind started blowing again...
She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
No doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier?  They don't fight for causes these days. They fight for money.  Who's going to pay them?
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
Yes.
That's not a lot.
I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
Knowing what I know?  Enormous gratitude.
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
No... not like this...
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
That's now what I meant...
Yes, but...
That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
Playing...
No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
Why would they?
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
What for?
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
Are you sent by God?
Whose were they?
Oh yes... very.
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
Him?
Why did she have to die?
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
Yes!  It was...it was unforgettable.
Wladek, please.
What are you doing?
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
What?
Funny time to say this.
Do they?
Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
I can look after myself!
Yes, but what good did it do?
You're amazing, Jehuda.
I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
There are always notices going up.
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
Where are we going?
I'm not going anywhere.
God forbid!
We're getting out.
Not yet.
Watch your feet!
That is good, yes.
Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys
The piano on the beach? Ada's piano?
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
No, words. You have never heard words?
Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
What will I play?
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
All of it.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
We'll be waitin'.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either.  You played the Big Con since then.
Yeh, it was easy.
No.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
I also gotta win.
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
Raise 5,000.
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
Where you goin'?
You doin' anything tonight?
He'd like to kill me.
You move right along, don't ya.
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
He cheats.
Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th.  She got me with her ring.
I don't know, figure something out.
No.
I'll make parole.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
Do you suppose.....  ?
Don't cry.
Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
Oh, here she is.
Nothing.
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
She... she fell over backwards.
Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
Take a good look at him, Dad.  Now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son- in-law.
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
A new invention?
You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
Only in bad weather.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
Not at all.
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
No.
He's holding out on you.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
Chris -- Chris -- !
So I see.
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
Go ahead!
That's all right.
Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
Well, let me do that for you.
What'll I do if something comes up?
That's all right.  What are you drinking?
It wouldn't hurt to put it in.
Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
Yes...
Oh, did he?  What did he say?
He didn't say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
All right - you didn't.
I had him out this morning.
Much better, thanks.
Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me.
Room service, please -
No.
No thanks.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
That's great.  I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
Yes.
Your guess is as good as mine.
Oh take it!  Please take it!
No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
Say you're the one who got me in this!
You dog!
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
I did find him!
What do you mean?
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
Why not?
What are you going to do?
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
Yes.
I hope you're well.
How did you get in here?
You worked here?
Yes.  Nick!
He's a good guy.  He sent me up the river once.  Hey, Nick!
I wouldn't know.  That time he caught me was a accident.  I led with my right.
Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right -- 
Y-yes.
Wha...
Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.
You don't know he isn't.
Then step aside.
Get out of my way.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
What about Jaeger?
Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
What are you doing?
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
I'd like to go home alive with a couple of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt.
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
They're not going to--
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
You can't tell anybody about this.
Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you.
Get up and dig.
Is it dead?
Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.
We'll find our way.
We'll find our way!  We'll...
Forget Wes.
What if he's not?
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
I don't want to die.
Don't you touch it.
Epps.  What if they're not Saudi.
We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
Why do I have to lie in the road?
Really?
I could use some recon photos too.
Just...want to be ready when we do.
People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
Naw, nothing.
You will.  You'll get it.
I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
Like I said; so?
Yes!
Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
Lines up with the map and the photos.
I think we found something.
He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
I'm not wasting my water on him.
triple three, triple three! easy.....
You've seen enough.
He wants me to come to his quarters.
Don't go.
I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
Look,dirt!
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
Don't let them separate us.
What?
No, look!  Three degrees from the central azimuth.
Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
What?
...and you're not lost now?
What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore.  Who are you?
What kind of answer is that?
Oh, That!  I'm 5555 SRT Entron..
....going well.  How could I be so wrong.  SCO 1202 cross wired a 904.  He's been receiving extra credit.  He offered me some.
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
Aren't you on suspension?
An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel.
Don't touch that.
What's wrong?
Which one's which?
What... ?
No excuses, just do it!
T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
Hey, I'm next.
Taylor's dead.
We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.
Insurance?
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
Fuck factor ten.
You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
That feeling won't last long.
It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
Report on the case so far.
It's our only option.
Where did you find it?
erect in sweater, arms folded.
He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
Constantinople?
And harems ... ?
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
Yes, Baron. Thank you. 
Just a second.
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
What do you mean?
M'sieu Monescu!
I would like to.
You're very welcome.  Countess, believe me, before you left this room I would have told you everything ... And let me say this with love in my heart-- Countess, you are a thief.  The wallet of the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine is in your possession. I knew it very well when you took it out of my pocket.  In fact, you tickled me.  But your embrace was so sweet ... 
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
Last year? It can't be that long.
Right.
They're all right, aren't they?
Darling, remember you're Gaston Monescu. You're a crook. I want you as a crook. I love you as a crook. I worship you as a crook. Steal, swindle, rob--but don't become one of those useless, good-for-nothing gigolos!
Five, seven, and nine--
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
You like that statue?
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
What shade of powder do you use?
As you like. 
It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
Isn't that wonderful!  You see, madame-- 
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
But attractive--
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
Instantly.
And you expect me to believe that?
Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of Colet and Company. Honorary president of the Orphans' Asylum. Adolph J. Giron--distinguished citizen! ... Well, shall I call the police?  I see! You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up--a self-made crook --then you say, "Call the police! Put him behind bars! Lock him up!" 
Yes, madame!
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
Yes, my bag!
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
...Mrs. Calvert?
It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.
You wanted to see the propellers?
Good. Settled then.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
Of course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night and surprise them all.  Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
No.
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
Worse I'm afraid.
It is that simple.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
I see you.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
Sure. If you like.
I promise.
It's so unfair.
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
No-o!
We'll be expecting you.
You work too fast for me, young man.
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
Thanks.
You don't know anything about me. If you did, you probably wouldn't be here.
Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
My change.
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Much better--thank you--
Think again--
I'll go with you--
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
Sure, I'll go.
Swell!
Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
What's that?
Your wife knows that, don't she?
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
Cut it out.
Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
I was never stiffer in my life.
All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot--
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
Is this your gun?
Will be--as soon as the ship sails.
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
I'll never love anybody else.
I don't get the humor of that remark.
<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
You can't bluff me any more.
That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
Sure, Sis.
Hey--you! Where you going?
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
You will after tonight.  Bet on it.
Credat Judaeus Apella.
In pace requiescat.
Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
Revenge?  For what?
I don't.
Good God, you're really-
I know.  Me neither.
He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him.
I know what it means.
Fun though, wasn't it?
You're a little touchy about it.
Doesn't suit you.
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?
Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
Fortuitous even.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
Did you ever see the sun come up Over the Rockies?  It hits all of A sudden and below there's California and you swear you're Looking at heaven.
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
That what you got me up here for?
McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious!
I'm the one made a mess.  Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing.
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
Isn't true.  I can't see a damn thing.
Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.
So to speak.
You are the one, Wyatt.  You sure are.
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
GET BOND OUT OF THERE.
Come. Let's get out of the noise.  - I'll give you a tour of the building, then we'll talk.
Sightseeing.
...Words to live by?
I appreciate your time -
Where can I find him?
Not all of us, 007.
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.
Is this another one of your games?
How is old Q?
I see...
... Kids?
No.
Have we met?
Thank you.  "Now hear this: Drop dead."
Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.
Up.
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
The Queen invited you to dinner -
Chew up a log like that in the propeller, you end up with enough paperwork to go from here to London. Twice.
It's Bond!
Who is it?
That's a lie.
Here I am thinking about myself when poor Harry is resting on the floor of the kitchen.
I told her I would if she would give me time.
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
Babe Brother.
Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor.
Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
Now how far would further out be?
It would be nice.
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
Let me get you a cup?
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
Of course not. Have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people? No you ain't.  You have to take just one and fatten him up. When you spread help too thin, you , you just nickel and dime the situation. If you try to save all, all die but if you save one life, life goes on. You just have to remember, medicine that works leaves a bitter taste.
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
Some folks take that natural stuff too far.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
Where does her get the power to summon all his old raffish friends? They all smell of moth balls.
He is in his pigeon cage.
You can bring ONE toy...
But what if we leave them behind?
Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
No, you can't.
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
Sorry there, old Spudhead.
How 'bout three out of five?
NO-O-O... Don't touch her!  NO!
She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
He tortures toys -- just for fun.
All right, that's enough.  Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
No, no, no, wait!
Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
Uh-oh.
No, Slink --
Slip up and change into a skirt, else he'll create something terrible. Don't you want to make a good impression on your first day?
What about school?
What did I do wrong?
Finn -
Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
Do you think we should take her up to bed?
Did you now.
All the time.
So did I.
Storms?
Victoria -
I don't know what you mean.
Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.
Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
Me, too.
I don't know.
Caroline --
Just watching you.
We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
Fine -- legalization.  Okay, forgetting all of our international trade agreements, legalize everything today.  The Government inserts itself into all drug transactions.  The U.S. becomes a giant pharmacy.  Our borders are mobbed, lines of people from here to Europe wanting to smoke, snort and shoot themselves into oblivion.
Oh, yes I can.
Sixteen
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
Have you done your homework, honey?
It's a funny fuckin' joke and it's quick.  Why do women wear makeup and perfume?
I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
She knows Arnie Metzger.
You want to make a wager on this?
Medicinal marijuana initiative.  Or am I being cynical?
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
Nobody said shit, Eduardo --
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
So go shower already.
Yes, sir!
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
Anyway, I don't think we'll ever see them again.  Everything's back to normal.
Then I guess I'm going by myself.
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
We agree.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
What is the name of your informant?
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
What is it you want me to do?
A small thing.  Nothing really.
Only if he can be trusted.
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
Just tell me where she is.
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
We sometimes went downtown to score.
The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
I'm sorry... Did I wake you?
Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit storm here right now.  When are you coming back?  I don't know what to tell people any more.
What kind of research?
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
I'm sorry.
You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come back --
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Ninteen.
Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.
Can you not go yourself.
What's your name?
Where are you going, Diane?
Out.
Well, it isn't.
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
Hey. Right. No problem. Whatever you say, man. You're the man, the governor, the dude in the chair, like. I'm merely here. But obviously I am. Here, that is. I hope I'm not talking too much. I don't usually. I think it's all important though, isn't it?
There's no need.
Right.
But try too hard --
Another dab?
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
Screenwriter?
Eh - Ian Fleming?
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.
OK, so who was it, then?
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
I'm cooking' up. There is a silence.
Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that?
So we've just come from Tommy's funeral and you're telling me about a skag deal?
Sounds great, Swanney.
No joy yet.
It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in.
Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
And that is?
Ah, Captain?
Are we leaving, Captain?
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
Goodnight, Doctor.
He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
Fascinating.
Yes, Captain.
If you think it would help.
I ordered you to defend this ship.
I have a half brother.
That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason Sybok left Vulcan.
It must be all those marsh melons.
The emergency channel, open.
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?
But I thought Captain Chekov..  I see. Very clever, Captain.  Spock, it would appear that you've been given a second chance to join me. What do you say?
In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
Now learn something about yourself.
You are mad!
No conditions.



Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
Why not?
Sybok, we must find a way...
Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has "invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?
Hello, Alan.
No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
Flynn?
The Pentagon?
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --
I, uh... I'm a program from a User that... knows Alan...?
No good...they might block off the old chip.  This way.
Greetings, program...
Yeah, I... oops!
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
Let's get some power here.
Jump.
You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
Alan-One...
We have to talk.
Are you kidding? You guys'll he running this joint by then...
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
Strategic Air Command.
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
Then I owe you some thanks...
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
I'm shocked.
Mom, wake up!  Dad barely knows we exist.
Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
Yes.
This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was.
What?
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Yep.  Sleep fast.
Here, check these out.
She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
Gonna try to get a closer shot of				* Beavis & Butthead.							*
Okay.  Here she comes.
Just hang a minute.
Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
What are you talking about?
You didn't have sexual relations with him?
You're welcome.
It's show time.  Don't look at					* the flash.  Do not look at the flash.
I don't know.  I guess... I wanted to see what would happen.
No!  Never!
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
It's okay, don't bother, Harry.
Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park.
Not because you were attracted to him?
No.
No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
I think so.
I don't take those assignments.
Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Fuck you.
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
Helen.
Find out who this Renquist it.
Knock wood.
You can't have just one.
And here we are.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
I'd love some pie.
What's your favorite color?
What kinda music do you like?
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
"Heroes For Sale"?
Uh-huh.
You better not be fucking teasing me.
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
With a vengeance, I hated them.
Why Cancoon?
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
Can you live with it?
Live with what?
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
Who the fuck are you?
Ask him if he got the letter.
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
Tell me.
Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.
Elliot.
The zoo.
Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.
In case of what?
This is our last chance to play "what if". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught.
What are we gonna see?
A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".
Unloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime.
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
That good, huh?
Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
What makes you think I could do that?
Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.
I give up. Who are you?
On their honeymoon.
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
They didn't tell me.
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
You and Robin moved?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Sure. No problem.
Could we try it now?
Not a tiny little vial -
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
He produced "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.
I'm not wearing a bra.
How do you know? You been there?
She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit!
And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
What kind of information?
They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
Do you know what year it is?
What year is it?
No, 1995 is the past.
What?
Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?
And I was in it?  What did I do?
What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.
James, why don't we...?
Lock it now!
You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
It was some kind of...war.  Never mind, you wouldn't believe me.  Turn off here.
That has your name on it.  Give him cash.
I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.
It can be dealt with, but only if you want to.  I can help you.
It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn, those words on the wall -- I've seen them before...  I...I...dreamed them.
In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.
What are you talking about???
Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.
Yes, sir.
You're insane, Jeffrey.
No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
Yeah, yeah.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
I'll bet my watch against your pay.
I'm a rich man off of thirty bucks?
I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
Yep.
Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Nothing.
You son of a bitch!
Sweet talk me all you want, I still want my hundred-forty-five dollars.
You've been there?
You believe that?
It is morning.
I want my car.
What's it to you?
You spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  But then you make friends so easily.  Don't you, Grace?
Uh-huh
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
Jake.  No.  No!
I got it.
You should be more careful.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?
You just walk away.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
What are you talking about?
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
Don't yell at me!
Where are you going?
I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
Yeah.  Good thinking.
Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
Just drive.
He was going to--
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
Grace!
John, you have to throw the keys up to me.
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
You idiot!  You'll kill us both!
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
Live there?
I was hoping we could talk.
That's a bit much.
Do we shake hands?
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
That's what I like about you, Jake. You're an honest man.
Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to ask you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?
How about I pick one out for you?
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Give it to me!
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
I know, Mr. Vesci.  I know.  I was on my way to you, it's just . . . what a day I've had.  You're not going to believe what's happened to me. I had the money, I swear I had it. I was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
Killing Jake McKenna's got to amount to something.  He wasn't much of a man, but that don't give you the right to murder him.  And don't tell me you didn't, 'cause I know you did.  I was there.  Like I said; I been watching you.
You want something, old man?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
You can't do that yourself?
All right, old man.  Christ.
Christ!
That's 'cause he's dead.
Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
...And everything is nothing too.
More or less.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Stand up.
Give it to me!
Who the hell are you?
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
How do you know if you've never tried?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
You love her, but you hate her?
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
...And he thought he'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000...
It's the truth, Jake.
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
No.
I'm just going to my car?
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
I just drove in this morning.
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Where'd you learn to do that?
Those are white words, not ours.
I have an idea.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
Try me.
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here.
Stop it.
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
I'm not coming back.
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
My mother died in this canyon.
That's a nasty cut you got there.
Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
"Arkady"
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
How much?
The ticket is 30.55.
Oh?
You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police...
I want my lawyer!
Yes.
Yes. Is this David?
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
It's finished. I won.
That counts.
Seventy-five percent.
Was it serious?
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind.
In the passenger car?
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
You told them cowboys you had it.
Thank God.
Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
You ain't dead.
I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
You could run off them two cowboys.
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.
I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
Letters?
Uh... Duke.
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
Duke.
And?
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
They got a sign on him in front of Greely's?
Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...
Sorry, Ned. Guess I wasted your time. See ya, Kid!
He got the boy's horse.
You missed him? You didn't...?
I got him.
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
Huh?
This Kid, what's he like?
She gave me the evil eye.
You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
You ain't like that no more.
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
Sometimes... yeah.  I don't miss it all that much.
Yeah.
Yeah?
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
Tom?
The Kid, yeah...
Only he wasn't carryin' no pistol this time.
All that money... I mean... did you...?
All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
I love you.
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.
I don't know. This is bad.
I can run. I got no problem with that.
Did you hear what he just said?
County. I was in for fraud.
We'll make it.
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
This I had to see myself.
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
Business or personal?
Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
You didn't know.
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
Where?
NOT FROM ME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. THERE IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME. You atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. Every criminal I have put in prison,
Came from Redfoot.
I tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn't have it. It was too far-fetched for him. Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop. To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated. It's always simple. There's
I don't have a minute. Are you saying it was Keyser Soze? You told the D.A. you didn't know who it was.
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
Because he was my friend.
I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
What did he find?
As far as we know, nothing.
Four cases in three years ...
No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
And no one will know the truth.
Mickey told him to call.  'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth.  He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye.  You meet him at the hospital.'
What does it mean?
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
Yes.
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
I'm going to uphold that.
I wouldn't do it.
I...yes.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
No, you did fine.
No.  No.  Thank you. You go home.
And you wrote that...
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.'  Is that what happened to Deborah  Ann Kaye?  She aspirated into her mask?
That's perfectly all right.  I'm kind of rushed.  Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
Right.  Who called?
You're going to settle out of court?
) I'm sorry ...?
I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
Who are you protecting, then?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him...
How come you're calling me from...?
This is Miss Costello...?
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
You just got lucky.   D'you eat yet?  Come on.
What happened...?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
Not if you don't grow up...
No...no...
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
What do you want?
I'm going to help her.
Admittance form is wrong.
Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
I'm going to get laid.
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I'm swell.
That's right.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
Read me what she said.
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
The 'History'...?
...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
... I'm sure you do ...
... fifty thousand dollars?
... I understand ...
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
She told me.
She did?
Yes, the roving nurse...
We, we were rather busy...
What happened in those three...
What happened in those three minutes...?
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
You don't have to do it for a living.
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
You're not far wrong.
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
You won't have to.
-- and how you happen to be living here.
I told you! My name is Judy Barton! I come from Salina Kansas. I work at Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I have to prove it?
Because I remind you of her?
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
Why?!
Yes --
No, it's not right.
You can.
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
Wherever you'd like...
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
But why? Why here?
I need you.
-- and wanted to go on loving you." And I said, "I won't lose you."  But I did.
And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
When?
I... didn't know where you lived.
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
Well... anywhere in particular?
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
No... no, I don't think that's necessarily true.
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
Where?
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
Vaguely...
I know.
I'm so afraid...  ...you won't let it happen...
Yes?! But --
I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up...
Where?
Why?
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
What is her name?
When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
What's tomorrow?
More than you think.
How do you know? Personal experience?
I had to quit, Midge.
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
That!?!
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
Do you know him well?
I'll take you home.
Think?  Well, what do you think?
Carlotta?
Oh?
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
Why?!
You're not a team player.
You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
And you're a little fucking reject.
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
What are you talking about?
Just giving the facts.
She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down.
You got us into this mess.
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
Don't talk to me about character.
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
It has worked.
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
They're singing.
I know and I'm honored...
I know...
What.
What does that mean?
I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?
Sweet deal.
Fish?
Give me two more.
Well, I didn't mean it.
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
Shut up.
So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them.  Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that?
No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
You always were a jealous man.
Shut up Boyd.
What did you ask me?
I don't know! I just want to get married.
What you just said. Say it again.
What are you going to do?
You got a nasty side to your thought process.
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
Fine? Fine what?
You need help.
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
I never heard that.
You have a King fantasy.
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
Lock up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico.
You said nobody would miss her.
Give me the Valium.
How about my Fatburger?
I love you.
The rings?
I'm not sure.
Why what?
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
What else have you forgot?
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
Right before the wedding?
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
Who else?
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
I've seen it on television.
Problems?
Hi.
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
Now?
Yeah. Look honey, I'll be right in. I just...we're just taking care of some Groomsmen last minute business.
Are they fighting?
Talk what out? We are locked and loaded here. We are non-refundable. I've got relatives on the airport right now! I've got...
Don't even.
What?
What are you talking about?
The prostitute.
You killed a prostitute.
The only proof is those bodies.
Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
I love you dad.
About what?
Same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button...  Micheal Brenn. Yes...Yes...  Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6.321 at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at 3432.343.  Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor, hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it. You're getting married and I'm not going to candy-coat it. It just gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body.
He's your brother.
That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
I got to agree with that.
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
I guess.
I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?
Okay boys, smile!
We will.
Then I'll get you in the fields tomorrow ...
Was that difficult to get?
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
Whatever you like.
What's the matter?
She won't even know.
No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving?
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
Where's the dough?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
Mother.
I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
Today, a good girl.
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist.  LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.
You think he's smart?
I need your help--
You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
Of the six prison inmates you've tested —— all of whom have had at least some military or survival training -— only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
I'm still making adjustments...
Do I get to see it or not?
Bastard...  Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
It's nano—technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
This is supposed to be years away.
How do you kill it?
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
How should I know?
Go to hell.
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better —— to improve upon what was already done.
Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
How did you get your hand out?
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're re—adapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
I'm doing the best I can!
I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
<u>Lure</u> him. 
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
<u>Hello</u>.  What?
Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
Gonna be fine.  Gonna be fine, people?  Are we getting there...?
...can we have a white one...?
All we have to do now is sell it to the President.
...and...
<u>Fuck</u> the world.  Try a ten A.M. <u>pitch</u> meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the <u>material</u>.
How do we explain that?  Ah, well, you see, Wilfred, this is where you've never been at a <u>pitch</u>.  You see? His <u>records</u> say he was in prison ... as they must, as <u>all</u> the records of Group 303 have the men and the women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere else, the <u>secrecy</u> required of....
What rig?
Okay.  And she's alleging...?
Who's got the story? 
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.
And you?
We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
<u>Who</u>?
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The Ribbon Manufacturers.
Waal, that's where you <u>want</u> em...
<u>Yes</u>:  she is saying this in Albanian, <u>but</u> she's doing it not to be uh...  But because, she explains, that is the only way it can be understood by her Aged and Sainted Mother, who is standing there with her, dressed in her Traditional...
Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
We're gonna do the <u>Team Song</u>.
8 days and we bring it back home....
Brazen it through?  Brazen it <u>through</u>?  They're going to hang us out to dry like the <u>laundry</u> --- do you know what we've <u>ddd</u>...
Hello?   No, operator...
Oh.  Hell.  And what do we do now?  What do we do <u>now</u>? Boy Producer?  Mister Win-an-Emmy, Social Conscience, <u>Whaleshit</u>, save- the-rainforest, Liberal hire-a-convict <u>shithead</u>? Mister Affirmative-Action Peacnik.  Commie... <u>shithead</u>....?
How do we explain <u>that</u>?
ON CAIN, AS SHE LOOKS AROUND.
It falls to me to <u>reveal</u> to you a <u>secret</u>.  To reveal the existence of a secret group of warriors. Men, yes, and <u>women</u>, trained and pledged their <u>strength</u>, their <u>skills</u>, and, if called upon, their <u>lives</u>, in the service of their fellow Americans. A group so secret, its very existence has been known to just a few, and known not by a Name, but by a Designation Number, Three-Oh-Three...
...we own it?
..."down safely," crew perished in the Crash....
Shoe, boy...?  You know, you were telling me you wanted Beans?  Remember, you were concerned about the Beans...?
...what is this?
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
Yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  How the hell, n'nu'n', I don't get what you want <u>me</u> to ...
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
It's not "war."  It is a <u>Pageant</u>.  It's a <u>Pageant</u>... Like the Oscars... why we came to <u>you</u>...
...it's a Teaser!
Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
Ten Days.  There going to be any Back End in this thing?
I gotta protect the Canadian Horder,
Where is he now?
Oh, you're gonna love this:
Mmm.
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
Of what?
Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
Eh?  I'm like the Rest of America.  I don't <u>care</u> -- I'm just <u>addicted to it</u>...
Some'b'y'll have you killed.
Ha ha.  No, no, not <u>now</u>, not <u>now</u>, of course, But Someday... when they tell <u>this</u> story...
He raped a <u>Nun</u>...
A proud tradition.
<u>Money</u>?  You think I did this for money...?  I did this for <u>Credit</u>.  <u>Credit</u>, paalll...
It's too clean.
Keep Talking....
Military Special Programs... <u>Programs</u>... No, I am not Shouting at you, I'm... I'm sorry.  Anyone named <u>Shoe</u> Schumann?  <u>Schuster</u>... uh
See y'at the Finish Line.
You like it?
Jim Belushi...?
And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...
...their Leopard Skin Berets....
...you're gonna Punch in a Kitten Later.
...gimme some help...
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
Forget charts! We're not fund managers, Bud, churn 'em and burn 'em. I'm offering you the Knicks and chicks. God save you before you turn into poor Steeples over there.
Lynch is giving him the boot... He's not pulling his quota.
Coulda been a contender.
...Work okay?
Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. We'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need. We're gonna compete with the big boys now.
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
I guess it's time to hit the road.
Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
What are you doing here?
Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here?
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
...finish out the game, Bud, push yourself...
Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.
Yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon: rule one, capital reserves. This company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. That buys us a lot of credibility...  ...and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker...
What does that mean?
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
Why do you need to wreck this company?
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
Where is it?
Break it.
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
...how do you know? You wish...
Old values. Buy.
No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.
...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of.
He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
Hmm.
It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
Thank you Jenkins
Thank you
Good evening sir.
You don't happen to have the address do ya?
Vell.  Goodnight.
What?  Tony and China, together?
A little?
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
Go away.
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
Oh! The virgin has spoken! SARAH Stop it!
Then we both are.
Because he was worried about me.
Your husband?
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
No.
Have you been hurt?
You were in an accident?
No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
I am.
Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
The wives.
When...when will she be back?
I don't know.
I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
No.  No, I don't.
Claire.
Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
I didn't sleep with him.
...just so she could cut them off.
Stop.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
Do we have to?
Okay, I'm a little tender.
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
Thanks, but I'm fine.
What?
Seance.
Jody, wait.
Then what was it?
I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
Adamant?
Why?
How is it?
No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
After that.
I'll be there.
Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
You didn't?
Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
This is the Feur thing?
We had a seance.
Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
Sweetheart--
Claire, please...
Call ya later.
I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now.
How did she know where it was?
Claire...
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
What?
Huh.
I know.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
:Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
Nothing was ever more false.
What are you talk---
He made that quite clear, yes.
Gifford - that box glued to your hands...?
Nothing worse than a common tool.
Who the hel1 -
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
Put your hatred for me aside, so you can clearly see what is ahead-
You're a monster.
You have the Mayfair eyes.   Tell me, Rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom...?
'He'...?
Stop it!
I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
The door, Michael.  find the key...
He just went out like & light-
I'll tell OR we're bringing -
Like this...?
If you knew how I yearn for that...
It's too soon to know.
No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
But have I...?  Ever...?!
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...
I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...
Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
You don't know what you meant -  because you don't know me.
You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
That's GREAT!
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
That's cause we're below sea level.
He's got great hands.
Is that a crack about our singing...?
Don't give me shit - what do you want?
And it can't be forged?
All the time?
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
What's with all the locks - and hammering
Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
then why did you marry her -
You've killed but you're not a killer
I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
Open it...
But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
No thanks - 
What was I supposed to do?
CRAP! - I wish I had taken a photo of your face when I gave some to that DETECTIVE - What's wrong ELLEN - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning?
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
One thing for sure, Christy Malone ain't lookin THAT good naked.
I defy any and all limits.
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon, you are extremely uptight.
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
You'll never believe who's in there.
Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold.
Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
You're way ahead of me again?
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
Whatever helps you cope.
That's me.
I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
Just a formality.
"Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
I don't get the distinction.
Interesting.
You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
Whatever.
Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
Well? Where the hell are you?
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
That's refreshingly deviant.
I'm very aural.
Not a chance.
Come on.
You think you're working with chimps here?
Keeping your word is something I can actually respect, Ted.
Only the best for my mother.
Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
If that were true, this would be one seriously constipated town. Most guys in Xenia have been looking at naked girls in "Heaven" since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress.
Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
You called the cops on us?
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
Really? You'd do that for me?
What kind of ideas?
--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
This is insane.
About Suzie?
He used to come around here.  He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.
She still work there?
I'm fine.  Nice TV.
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
He was large?
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
We don't know that, Ray...
What if I'm right, Gloria?  What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong?  What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
Whichever one I want.
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
Okay.  I love you too.
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
There's nothing for them to get.
Just like that?  These people ruined your life, bro.
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
And she wanted to talk.
Yes.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
That was the same thing Ray said.
We?
Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
Didn't you see her this morning?
If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
You go ahead.  I'll stick with Loveless.
My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Really?
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
Fine, I'll stop.
Private train?
He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.
When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
Yes!
We'll explain on the way.
It is?
You're not going to use it, are you?
They're not after me.  They want the baby.
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
What is Tir Asleen?
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.  You must learn to trust your intuition.
Why not?
I'm not going to let this baby die.
Say what?
I have no family.
I will!  But I need help!
Where the hell did you come from?
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
I thought you had her!
You?
I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle...
That's all I ever wanted!
Then I will teach you.
We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair.
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
Courage, Willow.
You're the guardian, aren't you?
Why not?
The sorceress.
Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
Oh sure, Fred.
Okay, Mr. Book.
Are they going to kill you?
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight – street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
Don't try me, Johnny!
Move! Or you die right here!
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
No.
Only the elders.
How long?
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
But you can't.
You tell him. When you're able.
What else can you do?
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
But... You may not be well enough.
I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea.
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
Make that 1790.
Probably.
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting!  Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!
Lean on him.
My son is out there!
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
If any!
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
You are?
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
Oh!  Well....
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Me?
Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
Oil can....
Well, you're perfect now.
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
What sort of an animal is that?
Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
You've had plenty of time already!
Oh, my!
Oh, my! 
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
I'd sooner wait outside.
But why?  Why?
Ohh!
Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas.  Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.  Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
It's pleasant down that way, too.
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
Where's Kansas?
Yes -- that's true.
To Oz?
Yes.  Oh -- look --
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
Did you just hear what I just heard?
It's too late!  There they....
What was that?
Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
Now...
Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
Yeah!
It's a whatzis?
Not nohow!
I want to see you and your wife right away....
You mean she bit you?
It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
Dorothy!
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
It's a whozis?
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
You put up a great fight, Lion.
Well, I --
It’s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
Like riding a bike.
Perhaps after this ... test?
Yes.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
Yes.
Partially, yes.
It’s my father’s pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
It’s not the pin your father wore. It’s an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
That’s every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? You think I can’t do it. You think I’m going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King’s daughter.
You’re not going to.
It’s the only way out...
I have to go to work.
A little. Does it matter? After all, what’s the point of living if you can’t feel alive?  Isn’t that right, Elektra? Isn’t that your motto?
...what?
Oh James.
Where did you get this?
Istanbul.
To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
Bond!
Please.
Someone will come.
Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
Still no contact yet.
Please.
Don't call me that.
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
. . . And just how would you manage that?
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
Because --
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
The missing scientists.
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
Memory lane.
Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
Did you know he was back on the streets?
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
Am I free to go?
What is that ungodly smell?
Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press.
Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the problem is. I wake up drugged to find what? You've got a "salesman" over here reading a three week old newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a "trucker", who happens to be packing a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. How's that for twisted logic? How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I "walked" in? And if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money? Then I notice how beefy they both are. Hell, even the waitress is cut. All three of them look like they went through the same training program. Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. That's how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day. Why?
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
Yes it does.
Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
They come in any other styles or colors?
I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money...
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does?
Of course.
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
We all do.
For what purpose?
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
I'll tell you one thing though.
Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
I felt like she almost killed me.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
And who might you be?
Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
Yes, sir?
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
Yes, sir.
Love me oodles and oodles?
Surprised?
I promise.
Does that mean you love me?
Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
Why does he call you 'master'?
Darling, you mustn't worry so.
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
Good.
A week.  Ten days at most.
Break that old man's violin.
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
I beg your pardon?
Did you hear that strange music??
What?
I want that brain.
Thank you, Master.
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
You can say that again.
That sound good, boss.
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
There's only one way.
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Soo -- pah doo -- per.
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
I don't know.  It just woke me up.
All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
And look at this, Doctor!
Good night!
I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
I see what you mean.
Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
There must have been someone else down here then.
The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
Yes.
Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.
1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
Our friend Colonel Dumford will be  should be   at this minute approaching Pulleine. I think we'll eat here. I want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour. .
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
They come well recommended do they? DURNFORD
And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40
But will they make good use of them?
A large party of Zulus have been sighted in the direction of the King's KraaL Getting up, CHELMSFORD moves over to look at the map on his desk.
Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
