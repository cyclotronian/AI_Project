Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
You know Chastity?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
Hi, Joey.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
That I'm used to.
Why not?
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
You got him involved?
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
You makin' any headway?
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
I'm on it
How'd you do it?
Are you lost?
Who's that?
What's this?
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
Pick you up Friday, then
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
Why?
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
No, you weren't
Start a band?
What are you doing here?
Unwelcome.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
The duck?
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
That ' s completely adorable!
Wait I...
My insurance does not cover PMS
Then tell them I had a seizure.
When I go?
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
What plan?
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
In the microwave.
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Did I have anything to say about it?
He's the devil's child...
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
I know.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
May I ask by whom?
How far from here?
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
To bring the word of God.
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
I suppose we're both old men now.
How old are you, Senor Colon?
Thank you.
We don't need to know.
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
He must be replaced.
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
What about Oleg?
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
But it's...
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Divorced.
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Do you have coffee?
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Who do you think, Chief?!
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
You goin' to the escort service?
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
So am I.
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
I'm not.
Okay, til tonight.
See you later.  Good luck.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
Where's Czech girl?
How long are you planning to stay?
Speak English!
Whore?
Get in the bathroom!
Let me get a shot of it.
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
As a plumber?!
It's easy to learn.
You've got a call.
Well, he...
I want to hear everything he said.
No.  Go ahead.
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
Well, he killed my partner!
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
What the hell happened?
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
CONTINUED
It's about my salary cheques.
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
Two more.
I guess not.
What is it, Hal?
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
CONTINUED
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
That's true.
Five by five, Frank.
I understand.
Roger.
Name?
Vodka.
Now how's your memory doin'?
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
Whaddya mean, buy?
I'm candy...
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Hello, again.
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
You lying son of a bitch...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
You here to write my life story?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
Must be billy's girl.
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
Not likely, convict.
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
No class...
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
I lost them, that's what happened.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
Yeah.
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
So do you...been a long day.
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
I don't think your gun's loaded...
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
You sure you want me to?
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Hey...
What do you want?  What's goin' on?
Keep stallin'.
You chickenshit punk...
How much?
Five bills.
Corn-i-Lius?
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
Why?  What's wrong with me?
You are a monster, Zorg!
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
Good luck..
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
Where's Leeloo?
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
...Priest...
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
You little sleaze bag!
You know how to fly this thing?
What mission?
Dinoine chagantakat!
Apipoulai!
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
I want to sleep... forever...
Exactly.
Not going to open?
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
Drink!
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
I don't know what to say
Don't...
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
Machine.
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
Yeah, who's this?
Don't ask questions.
I want his name.
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
I was well compensated.
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
Not quite.
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
You're learning.
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Alright, I get the picture.
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
What's next?
My condolences.
My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.
No.
Nothing remotely like this.
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
Hello... ?
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
What was she running from?
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
What are you talking about... ?
Who is this... ?
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
None too discreet, is he?
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
Rick...I can't.
I can't go back to sleep again.
We'll figure it out.
I'm sure they're around.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
Here we are.
Enough of that crap.
Hey, Rick!
So?
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
What?
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
I gotta get out of here.
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
She doesn't want me around
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
You're right.
I've got to go.
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
Who's Jacob?
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
Who?
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
You, too?
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
What course, Skipper?
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
Obviously.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
What happened?
This way.
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
Yeah.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Open the door. We're late.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Why do they do that?
You know.
Was it funny?
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
What then?
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
It belongs to Pop.
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Something bugging you?
On what you pay me?
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
Lillian!
We should talk.
Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
Did you get his number?
Good. Who?
I still don't understand --
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
I'm sorry about what I said.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
What happened?
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
It don't look right.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
Yeah.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
No shit.
Well, it was an accident.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
No thanks. I don't drink.
Then who shot him?
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
I'm sorry, honey.
How was...  ...the ballet?
There they are!
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
You read my mind.
Put your pilot on.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
Stand by.
What do you want with us?
I know he left you behind.
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
Sir, we stay with the President.
May I speak to you for a moment?
She's a big girl.  She understands.
Did they say anything about my family?
What's going on?
Where's my family?
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
My god. I think that was a MiG.
Shit.
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
Did you feel that?
Te...!
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
Elaine!
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Simon just ejected!
You mean...
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
I think so.
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
Go ahead.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
Request; life support systems check.
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
I don't want to hear that word!
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.
You folks need any help?
Striker.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
You got a telegram from head­quarters today.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Yes, Captain?
How ya doing, honey?
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Oh, I'd love to.
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
We have clearance, Clarence.
He's not here.  Why ask me?
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
William Harcourt?
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
Well... yes, quite possibly.
What is this?
And that fits?
Did you talk to him?
Back off, George.
... and so, and so the doctor says, "If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?"  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.

How do I look?
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.
Yeah, I heard of it.
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
Yeah, Sykes?
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
Now, wait a second --
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
Yes, Hicks?
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
They'll get us.
Hicks, don't let him leave.
Fuck you.
Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!
You're just reading me.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
No, it's different, honey.
Mommy...Mommy?
Why won't you check out LV-426?
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
No.
Did you know? Had you heard?
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
I want to go!
Now?
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
Yes!
Tell them to go!
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
Who was that?
I can't write it!
Tonight?
But! I'm a married woman!
He asked me to stay.
Oh, yes.
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
I said play!
What a strange young man.
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
Yes?
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
Where?
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
That's right.
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
Can I see it?
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
Did you like it, then?
How could I not?
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
Of course not.
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
You burned the score?
But what is it they don't like?
How long will you give me?
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
I do.
The doctor thinks I am. But -
Would you? Actually, you could.
Yes.
What time?
And that's all?
Do you want to rest a bit?
What for?
That will do, Herr Mozart!
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
So?
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
Where?
Oh my son, my poor son!
I'll call tomorrow.
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
What happened to them?
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
And what else?
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
What shall we do?
Mr. Kessler?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
Aw come on, Miss Price!
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
Hello. You all right?
That's easy enough.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
But, David.
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
The zoo?
Why on earth do you say that?
Who is this girl?
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
You've never had bad dreams before?
Did you see Jack?
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Go on, ask them.
Beware the moon?
What do you think was wrong?
There aren't any coyotes in England.
Pecos Bill.
I don't know. Come on.
It sounds far away.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
We were attacked by a werewolf.
Nurse!
What are you doing here?
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
You don't have to say anything.
If I was still alive, I probably would.
You look awful.
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
Then you have some hot tea?
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
Oscar, what's the matter?
Matt?
What do you mean, help?
Oh!
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Line?
Why are you so anxious?
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
What's this?
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
Much better this morning, thank you.
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Yes, of course.
Oh!
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
Yes, sir.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
Hello, Helen!
With what?
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
He was here?
What time did Matt Brown get in?
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
Yes.
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
Uhh, yeah it does.
Swear.
I swear --
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
What?
What you sayin' boy?
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
Not now.
She had a moustache.
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.
The James-Younger Gang.
I got seven thousand.
It's not a bank.
Jesse, we got to have a word.
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
A bad idea.
Dammit!
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!
I think one of 'em's glass.
Of course!  Uh, sir?
Of St. Louis?
Hell of a war.
You can shut up now.
You've killed your fair share of men.
We're drunk.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
Can't argue that.
Uncle Frank?
How much of that story is true?
A fair number, Ma.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
Jesse, is that your hand?
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
Where will you find such a girl?
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Zee.
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
How can that be?
I want them arrested and hanged!
"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
Stop it. I'm...
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Pick me up?
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
Yes, darling?
He's rich.
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
Where are you going?
But where?
Picked them up from the printers yesterday
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
Listen, what about dinner?
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
It's just not.
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
Patrick? Is that you?
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Where are you going?
Patrick?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
SHUT UP!
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Dorsia.
We are totally booked.
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
What is it?
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
Yes, Patrick?
Oh no. I have no plans.
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
Jean? What?
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you.  You don't want to get hurt, do you?
Patrick Bateman's office.
What are I doing?
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
Who?
Paul Owen.
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
No.
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
So, what's the topic of discussion?
Understandable.  Lime?
No, I guess it's okay.
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
Actually, yes.
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
Great, yes, I'd like that.
I'm so hungry.
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
No, Owen.
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
When's Brian coming for the TV?
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
...Whaddo I do?
Nothing.
I remember.
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
Milo --
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
Milo?
...wanna savor this.
Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
And Outpost? You're happy there?
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
He's pretty tight with his family.
Who's that?
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.
I heard what happened.
'Have a look?
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
...You wanna work -- here?
...Were you?
...Something like that. Yeah.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
I snuck into #21.
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
...Milo?
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
Jesus, Teddy.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
What does that mean?
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
Maybe he'll get back to work.
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
Come in.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
Or sometimes not at all.
Care for some saki?
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
Be careful.
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
Thank you, Exposition.
She's working on another lead right now.
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
Carnies.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
My God, Austin, what have you done?
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
That does not compute.
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
My mother's told me all about you.
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
I haven't had fun like that since college.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
Kiss me.
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Ow! You shot me!
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
An evil vet?
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?
Great.
He's asleep.
Well, it's kind of weird.
We don't judge here.
... love ...
Promised? Who promised?
Mr. John Steed, please.
You are female?
As you see.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
This isn't a game.
You're mad.
Such as?
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
For a man in my position --
After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
No thanks.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
Not quite. This is my field.
Do you always drive this fast?
This must be the last straw.
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
To kill me?
No trouble.
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
Not for a moment.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
It's called Black Leather.
Trubshaw again? What now?
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
Where's Mother?
I shall need a small plane.
We want Mrs. Peel.
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
Weather's turning nasty.
I feel sure of it.
No, please! I beg you ...
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
The last one you'll ever see.
You're better than I expected.
I was at Harrow ...
If you say so.
You said ... one shot.
What's happening?
Does Cole know about this?
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
You're kidding.
Hey, you guys, what's going on?
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
Five thousand dollars.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
Mr. Thomerson.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
Cole?
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
What are we having?
Good...
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
Can't I just go with you guys?
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
Yeah.
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
Why is Cole here?
Gary, you're quite an animal.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
I just want to be alone.
Really?
Ed... you're kinky!
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
Reach out and snort someone.
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
Did you do it for Tim?
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
What, you've never seen one before?
In the Field Museum once.
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
Thanks.
...Not now, Brian.
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
You think that's really any of your business?
Thanks for the invite.
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
Hi.
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
Yes.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
I need another one, sir.
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
And the putty around the door?
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Aren't you even curious?
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
Tell him about me, Shadow?
Got a cause?
People.
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
I forgive you.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
Do you have the money?
What money?
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
What case?
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different.  Can you do this for me?
Well you did.
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
I'm out.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
How long has my father been like this?
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
Do you know how you will use him?
I'm in till the end.
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
What is this?
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
This is crazy.
You sound like the media.
What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
It looks delicious.
Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
He said that?
Where is he?
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
Yes you!
To come back to our roots.
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
I thought you got rid of...
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...no, she didn't...
...too late, maybe around...
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
The good stuff.
What else?
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
And?
Don't try to change to the subject.
Good day to you, young sir.
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
Both of us ride home with Best here.
Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
Sir, I'm a British officer.
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
And his baggage?
And so I am.
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
Not even that.
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
How so?
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:
All the same, you must name an amount.
Was he cheated?
Then this must be done tomorrow.
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.
Would you have me spend my life all alone?
The milkmaid's daughter?
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
I asked for a policeman.
I just don't like it.
Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
Some.
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.
You saved Kendall's life --
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
Epilepsy.
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
What the fuck is going on?
So you killed him?
Where have you been, Jay?
You hated West more than any of us.
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
Oh, come on --
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
I didn't kill him --
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
What the hell are you talking about --
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
He's in interrogation?
Move him.
Why?
Something like that. You?
The very same.
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
You couldn't have known --
Four --
Hardy, what are you doing --
What if I don't want it?
He was your friend.
Pike, please --
The faggot speaks.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
So you took off your shirt?
He said what?
No one else heard it?
What happened with Nunez?
What the fuck happened to you --
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
Bloom like a flower?
You were expecting me?
The poet? What ever happened to him?
You get the eye?
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
The one about the witch.
Really.
Why not religion, Dad?
But the real story is how I got the car. You see...
Son?
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
I'm sorry.
So what are you up to now?
Do you like it, being pregnant?
I talked with your father last night.
You never told me how your parents met.
You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
Did you and Dad have any other property?
You know what for.
No I don't.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
Do you want to stop?
You can see why it's sensitive?
Tell me what he said.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
John.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
Yes.
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
Give me some money.
What?
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
I don't hate you.
Why?
What?
It wasn't what I wanted.
You don't understand me.
What?
I don't want anyone to die.
I don't know.
It's not mine.
You have excellent English.
What are you doing?
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
You liked what I brung ya?
Hey.
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
Hi.
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
Yeah.
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.
This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
Better than what you give.
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
Don't... don't say that to me...
I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.
Uh-uh.
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
They sure liked them devilled eggs.
What is it?
Sorry.
How you feelin' today?
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.
Why you say that?
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
Nuh-uh.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
The hell is this shit?
Keep the change on that.
Thank you.
Rae don't do this now...
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
Yeah?
Ronnie. Please, baby...
Didn't know you was workin' here now?
I just wanted some make-up.
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
What are they doing now?
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
Let's go.
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
Are you expecting anyone?
Nick!
Give us a break...
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
Nick --
A resort city, Beppu.
Big enough.
It's illegal, Nick.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
I don't know.
Think we'll get him, Nick?
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
How big a package we talking about?
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
I planned on catching him, Captain.
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
What's this?
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
I took Kobo from the street.  I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man.  Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun.  He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired.
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
Good.
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
He knows what he's doing.
Then go get him.
The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.
What about E.M.S. recombination?
Just thought I'd...
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
She's not with you?
If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?
Well, when do you get paid?
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
It's okay.  Forget it.
Sorry, don't have the time.
I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you like my new suit?
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
What's suck night?
Does it eat?
Me.
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
I'd take him to the doctor.
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
You use your equipment, don't you?
I can imagine.
What do people do in the afternoon?
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
Bad?
But in your profession that is a risk.
If she is, the machine works.
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
Of course.
Beautiful.
You like it?
My office.
For how long?
How do you do?
Get out of here!
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Oh, that's nice.
Yes, I'm right?
Again.
What is it?!
Over this?
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
I think it's the eyes.
Watching television in color.
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
This is for me.
Sure.
I didn't know that.
One who's not a mutant.
When do you need her by?
I thought only hookers drank those things.
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.
May I please be excused?
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
You wanted to see me!
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
What?
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Hi, Eve!
No.
Is that a birthday cake?!
What?
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
I've got to go, now.
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
Tempus fugit!
Why?
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
Not particularly.
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
No.
Yeah?
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Not on him.
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
Almost all of them.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
Good-bye, Adam.
Bye, Adam!
Thirty-five.
Say what?!
Oh. A nice one, I hope.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
Are you in trouble, son?!
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
You got a light, honey?
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
No.  They all do.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
The locks?
You have tranquilizers?
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Calvin!
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
Well, I am the head of this household--
I thought ten years.
Or have perfect table manners.
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
Where did he get all that information?
And if we can't find him?
What's wrong?
Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
Tower, say again!!
Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Who knows you have these?
That oughta do it.
Jeffrey.
THEN WHAT?
Don?
See my nipples?
Yes, I like you.
You don't?
No. What is happening?
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
Oh shit.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
No. I should go.
Come in.
It used to make me laugh, but.
What do you want to do?
Beeeee careful.
Alright, suit yourself.
Oh he forced you, huh?
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
You want to see him too, right?
Look at these. What are these?
What are you lookin' at?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Yeah?
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
That sounds great!
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
So, what's next?
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Okay, yeah, call.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Well, how did it go? What happened?
He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
Yes.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
No.
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
I need Il Duce.
Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
What?! What are you doin'?
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
We paid attention in school.
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
Be careful.
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
Nine bodies.
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?
He isn't to be touched.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
So, what do we do now?
It was... It was...
The Greeks. The Italians.
No way they could have seen it?
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
Who the...
Chief, what the fuck is this?
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
A couple of peons for the mob and...
Liberating isn't it?
So?
What is it my son?
You feel?
Has he now?
You gonna do what I say, got it?
Yes.
Don't do this my son.
Have you no fear of God?
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.
Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.
Fuck you Vincenzo.
Making Hutch David Soul?
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
Would they do that?
That sets it off.
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
Where's the manager?
I don't want to use it.
Yes, they are.
What about them?
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
He went back for his brother.
When'd he tell you?
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
Don't panic, Anthony.
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
Get out of the way.
Yes. I do.
Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow.
You're all clear.
Uh-huh?
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
It's going back down.
Freeze!
Help me move him.
Wait for Kumar.
He did?
What?
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
Did Dignan take the test?
I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
Let them fight.
I hope not.
I'm not playing any more golf.
You think I'm improving?
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
Yeah.
Were you born in Mexico?
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
That's Anthony.
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
What?
I don't know about that.
Not even for emergencies?
I thought your parents were in Italy.
What are you talking about, Bob?
It's true, Dignan.
I warned you, Dignan.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Watch me.
Come on!
He's having a heart attack or something.
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?
Where did he go?
Well, I left some money in there.
No, my friend knows her.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
Mr. Henry?
The world needs dreamers, son.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
Don't you want answers?
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
Sit down.
No good options left?
She say what time I should call?
Keep going...
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
I have to go now.
I emptied it.
I'm sorry.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
You drive.
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
There must be another way!
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
Yes.
Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
Who's this?
I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
Am I a doctor, no, but...
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
Someone dead from this household?
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
The Scots will fight for us?
Stephen ready?
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
Keep these. We're going too.
They're coming!
With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
Wanna stay with me tonight?
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
A common thief.
Let her speak.
I do not confess.
Your father doesn't like me, does he?
Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
I've missed you.
Then when?
How do you know this?
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
Darn it!
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
Weirder than this?
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
Dad lives here?
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
I thought you were a December baby.
I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
What do you mean?
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
We're really gonna be in a movie!?
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
I couldn't cut the rope.
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
Huh?
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
Lenny? Come on!
So you decided to go to America.
-- Will he keep his word?
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
Yes, Monsieur.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
Here you are.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --
We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.
I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
What are they?
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
Why there is no other man in my life?
Yes, of course, we --
Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
I didn't count the days.
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
Everything is quite all right.
It's been a long time.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
Goodnight.
Our faithful friend is still there.
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Yes, Victor, I was.
Are you ready Ilsa?
He came from Paris with Rick.
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
I beg your pardon?
You seem to know all about my destiny.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.
-- Thank you.
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
This is hardly the time or the place.
For the time being.
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
But everybody's having such a good time.
It was a combination of all three.
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
Manages what?
This is the end of the chase.
Why two?
He is traveling with a lady.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life.
One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
Then don't have a drink.
Yeah, boss?
Just a little something of my own.
It's bad.
Get up.
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.
You know what happened to this?
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?
What brings you out to the sticks?
Yeah, a long one.
Sonofabitch!
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
You don't seem too happy about it.
Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But I have to go.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged into something.
This is so unfair.
You too.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
Kamal is not here.
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
You are one sick fucker.
How about we go somewhere else?
Digital laser readers.
Take your time.
San Francisco.  And you?
Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
So, Mrs...
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
But you looked as if you liked it.
What's the *medical* explanation?
But you had so much *responsibility*.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
Do you think she'll be all right?
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
That's true.
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
What's a nanny do?
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
But she's your *daughter*...
Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
First pregnancy?
Christ, it's oil of tansy!
In other words, scurvy.
He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
I'm happy I amuse you.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Shit. We don't know what he is.
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
So, what do you do?
Silicon Valley?
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
We were back on.
After you cut her loose.
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
We'll take care of it.
So what? We hide, right?
Moonan. Here. Shit...
It can buy you a new and better you.
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
She up for this?
Eight A.M. flight.
I have a good crew.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake.
Sorry, I --
Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
Mr. King, I think --
Uh... Everything okay?
He's gone.
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
It's what I do. It's my job.
Do you have something to prove?
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
Sounds respectable.
He was looking out for you.
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
You tell them the "Tale".
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
What?
I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
What?
What happened?
Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.
I can handle it.
You sell it.
Jack Manfred.
I can imagine.
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
I despise the job.
Not like Matt, you mean.
I'll try and make it.
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
I've got something to tell you.
I loved it blond.
I don't like it.
That girl, she works at the casino --
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
Leave me alone, Marion.
No.
Don't let yourself down.
There's a casino in this hotel.
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
Do you believe in astrology?
Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.
Wait a minute...
Yes.
It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
Ross.
And what do you do, Lucy?
Where to?
Nice car.
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
I'm off. I need to sleep.
Rough day?
I make it six.
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
What flickering light?
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
Yeah.
The key, goddamit, the key!
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
Quantum is up thirty-five.
Rechannel all safety relays --
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Check at six minutes.
Hey, bomb...
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
Hello, Pinback, are you there?
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
Talk to the bomb.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Yeah.
What?
Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
You mean until you showed up?
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
Do you know why I went after Justine?
It's a sweep.  C'mon.
Lemme put some clothes on.
Which is none of your business...or mine.
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
So Max, what do you do with all your money?
Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
No...
What makes you cry?
First time I ever heard that.
Who is...
Lauren's not my wife.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
Something.
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
You got a lotta nerve.
Bent?
Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
I need to talk to her.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
A long time.
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
She tells you how I've been--
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
I'll give it my best shot.
She was the one--
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
What about this?
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
What are you, high?
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
What was that D.J.'s name again?
Any luck?
Shit, that dork is Jam.
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
Whoa... she just farted.
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?
Uh... dudes?
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
It's my Bullworker.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
Go ahead, Jam.
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
They're not idiots.
I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.
Twenty-five more'n I got.
What do you want?
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
Yeah, you did!
Hi... what's going on here?
Theoretically.
Like a DeLorean.
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
Dea ex machina...
I want to show you something.
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
Why do they call you Frank?
We went to a hotel.
How old is Grandma Death?
Hey...
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
We're moving through time.
They suspended me for two days.
So, we call them... IMGs.
Hey.
My mom is gone.
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
Cellar door.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
Frank.
How are things going at school?
What else do you think about during school?
Can anyone else see him?
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
Why would I tell Mom?
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
How much are they paying you to be here?
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
What I think is going on with your son.
If that's what you think is necessary.
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
What else?
Kitty...
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
Where is she?!
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
Loretta, never have kids.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Mrs. Leeman?
Ow!
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
C'mere. I love you so much.
What?
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
Okay... well, bye.
Hi.
Shut it up, Loretta.
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
Gladys! Stop it!
Becky was my only shot at state!
Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
Okay, everybody, listen up!
What!
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
"My dear President"...
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
What's the matter with you?
Hey you!!
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
I don't wanna work at all.
What do I get?
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware".
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
So! -- He's on your side, too.
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
Are you getting tired?
Excellency, may I present my niece.
Then it's war?
I don't remember.
Was it -- swine?
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
One or two?
Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.
Our man is sick. Come right away.
Now I think we really do understand one another.
Good! How is the patient?
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
Can you imagine what his life has been like?
Yes, I think I can.
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
I don't know what I've got.
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
Alas, no.
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
Romance!
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
How awful for John.
Is he... dying then?
That's a canopy, John.
Not at all, John.
The children! May I see?
...my... home?
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Mr. Treves! Treves.
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
Pardon me?
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
Right! Where is he?
Well... where is he?
WHAT did you say?
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
What's the matter?
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
You're as bad as my father.
I see the world.
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
I'm sure it's lovely.
Really.
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
Why should you care?
I know!
She got me thinking...
What "magic"?
What did he say?
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 
What are you talking about, Erik?
But HOW?
Look, I bagged it last week.
She hasn't got any.
What's all the panic about?
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
I'm not worth risking your life for.
Get away, Snorri.
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
Wasn't it, Keitel?
Relax!
You've lost your mind.
He drove me mad!
No... he's not... not... there...
And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
And I just liked you so much.
Why?
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
I can't remember.
I don't really know how --
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
Yeah.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
What?
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
Frost?
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
Ready for another?
Well, I should probably get going.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
You'll call me, right?
Where are you going?
I don't think we're ready.
Such a beautiful view.
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
What if you hide me?
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
There's this guy!
What?
Not yet. Not married.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
Seems too coincidental that way.
I do sort of live with somebody though.
I knew.
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
It's dark.
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
I don't know. What if it breaks?
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
Guess what I'm wearing.
It was snowing.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
You have to stop this!
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
I miss you.
Yeah.
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
Hi.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
That's lovely.
We can't do this.
Howard, they've disappeared again.
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
What was that?
What do you believe in then?
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
Tell me about it.
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
No, I guess not.
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
How does she like what in bed?
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
Why? Why do you have to go?
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
Hitchhiking?
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
A job for me?
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?
You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.
Justin?
From what?
Coop, where are you...
What?
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
How is he?
Do you hear it? Right there.
Pressure?
Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity...
What does it say?
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
Yes.
It's insane.
What about it?
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time.
I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.
You said this ship creates a gateway...
Yes...
Don't... don't do this...
You know.
Jesus...
Captain Miller, you copy?
Smith, get out of there...
We're all here.
It tastes bad.
The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
Carbon dioxide?
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
What's causing the readings?
What is it, Starck?
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
What's going on in there, Starck?
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
Weir can't be alive.
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
There's no one in the corridor but us.
Almost got it.
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
You can't do that.
What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
What is it?
I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
He didn't.
I'm worried about you.
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
What do you mean "complete"?
And where do we think we're going?
He's not responsive --
Now what is up with that?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
What is that thing?
Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
And if he's not...?
Leonard, how's the feed?
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
Why didn't you say something?
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
It's just business.
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?
What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
I can't find it, mon!
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
Your friends use the pool too.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
Where did you hear that?
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
Dad says you have to get up!
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
Do you have any ice tea?
Do you want to take a quick swim?
Well...
Pick a suit.
What's wrong?
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
No Damone. I don't understand.
You're losing it, Damone.
I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
Seen the new Playboy?
What the fuck is this guy doing?
How's it going.
Should we buy a frame for that?
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
Was it great?
You'll always remember your first time.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
No. But it's a nice idea.
You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
Dartmouth?!
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
Can I come in?
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
Well, you'll find out next year.
I had a really nice time tonight.
Do you want to come inside?
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
Naked!?
What happened? What did they do to her?
Las Vegas.
Oh, my God!...
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...
Where's the medicine?
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?
Shoot it.
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
Not much. Why?
Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
Yeah... I thought we might need it...
Where'd you get that knife?
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
You degenerate pig!
Plans?
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.
What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.
What is this?
Adrenochrome...
You realize...
In that case, maybe she can help.
We can't risk letting them in.
Where is everyone?
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Well, it don't look pretty.
Stop it.
You got something better?
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
Your brother, huh?
It's much safer in there, sweety.
How much you got to see the show?
Huh?
What?
Fully.
Keys.
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
SHIT.
OH JESUS!
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
What's wrong?
Hold it!
Oh my God... What is that?
Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
Well... come on.
What're you doing?
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
You're afraid!
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
Right now we have to be practical.
In my eyes, officer.
Really?
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
What do I do, Dad?
You really want to go?
Of course.
Francie, you know I can't do that.
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
I just wanted to see how you looked.
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
...So you think I should go.
What?
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
I know what ability you're interested in.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
Think I'll have a glass.
And?
Evening, gorgeous.
Where are we, mean man?
What a man!
Huh?
You give up on her?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
I'm not sure.
What'd you do?
Who're you?
The speech? Real good.
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
Then why did you bring them?
You kill me, Mama.
Where are you going?
How long will you be?
I'll be back.
At one. Promise?
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
Mama, shut up!
I'm going out!
Oh, just leave those things for now.
Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
Thanks are hardly necessary.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
I see.
And what's that?
Normal. Average.
This whole thing is a joke!
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
Yes. It was very good to see her.
Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
Then why weep for him?
I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
Materials. Nothing more.
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
What can I do?
Yes. I want this over and done with.
What is this?
What does it say?
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
So do I.
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
It's going to ram us.
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
Quite a few.
They'll hang him all the same.
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
That's blasphemy!
It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
Thank you, Henry.
What happened up there?
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
Paracelsus?
What is your name?
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
Are you a physician?
Ah. An explorer.
I heard.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
Tomorrow is another day.
Any particular reason?
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
Good point.
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
Let's go back, Barry...
You just had some lucky shots.
That was the telephone.
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
Are you wet?
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
It's beautiful...
You okay?
Anything else you want?
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
Good luck.
How many with you?
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
Twenty-eight.
What's this guy's problem?
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Not a chance.
Come again?
Yes.
In heaven.
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Yes.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.
I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
Why are you so agitated?
Okay, does anybody here know what's going on?
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
You're gonna let us go?
We have to go back for Daddy!
Daddy's dead.
-- you got your sink --
-- you got your shower --
Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
I wasn't scratching!
Richie? You okay?
Do they have a waterbed?
Did you even to try to negotiate?
All I'm saying --
What'd ya see?
Cops.
Seth, if you were me --
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
I did?
They broke when you fell.
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
You could take their head off.
Who's "we"?
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
Wow...
Your prerogative, Senator.
Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.
I'm fine, sir.
I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
Well.  'Least now we're talking the same language.  So one standard.  Is that what you're after?
So I'll get a fair shot?
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
Newberry, get a photo.  South?
Hardly the case, Senator.
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
I was one member of the investigating commission.
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"?
Come on, Montgomery...
Sir?
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
The Navy Cross...
You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil?
You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
"In Washington..."
When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts.
They had to kill 'em?
Just askin'
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact.
Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
Would you have shot if it was a man?
That's not right.
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
I take it this file is still open.
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
I'll take them all.
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
Nesting?
I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
We've secured the doors on both levels.
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal.
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
Are you looking for this?
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
What'd they say?
Hello?
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
This is it?
Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
God, what an ass.
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
May I get the check?
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
How did you come to that conclusion?
No, wait, are you-
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
Systems register functional.
U.... What do you think?
So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
They're gone.
It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
Are they behind us?
Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
Clenched jaw...
Jason.. Can you hear me?
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
never doubted you for a second.
Wait. What did you say?
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
Could be this.
Hold course, Laredo!
Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins.
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
You seem pleased by the prospect.
Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
You, you just need a new flint, General.
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
Me?  You apologizing to me?
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?
I'm so inclined.
It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating.
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?
To hell with Arnold...
You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous reputation.
But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
I feel the same, sir.
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
General Greene?
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis.  Marquis, you must go with him.
If the constitution is ratified... we'll have a country.  They'll want to elect you president of the convention, which means president of the country.
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
Africa, of course.
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
Yes!
My daughter, I ask only...
For God sake, get that horrid stuff off your face.  You look like a damned slave!  It's damned humiliating.
He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.
What about him?
Trade for what?
About sixty.
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
Ray Barboni?
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
Sovereign.
Get in line, bro.
Your wife a Lakers fan?
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
You're not looking at me, Harry.
You mean, Leo?
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal - this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer -
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
Hey, Harry.
Really.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
One of mine?
What happened? The pressure got to you?
At that point, basically, that has to be it.
You've been losing.
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
How? By taking my money?
It's all mine.
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
Man, can you scream.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
Hello, Doris.
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
Harry -
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories.  Of us.
Really.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over.
A passenger liner, north island. Over.
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
North Island, please repeat? Over.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Your radio check is affirmative. Over.
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
Let's not be too hasty.
You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
Where from?
Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
Maybe that is his boat.
Smokes?
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
Hard to say.
How long?
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
Murphy.
What is it?
It was a man's voice. Repeating some sort of children's rhyme. I don't know, it didn't make any sense. You didn't hear it?
You smashed it!
Don't lie to me!
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
Sudden flashes of light.
What?
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
You just shoot at something?
Collision? With what?
Couldn't sleep.
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
Epps? You there?
What do you think?
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
I don't give a damn about the gold.
If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.
I don't know.
I say we off-load some of that gold now.
What happened?
What's this?
Fifteen, at the most.
Someone from the past.
Are you going to yell at me?
About what?
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
I...
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
No.
Oh, hi...
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
What is this?
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
Look, maybe that's him!
It's obviously him!
Oh yeah...
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
Why are we going here? I hate this place.
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
Where?
God, how can you stand all these assholes?
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
Fuck it. Everything must go!
Don't worry.
What thing?
Why? What did he say?
Nothing.
When was this?
I said "great"...
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
There.
Do you want anything?
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
How much is this?
You still interested in that?
Hi... what's your name?
Yes.
Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
I did too!
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
PLEASE? We have to!
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Wow! Look at all these creeps!
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
Oh, hi...
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
And you like them?
I... I don't think so.
Does that mean you don't like me?
So, do you like me, Seymour?
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
No... forget it...
Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records?  She could at least have the decency to call me back.
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
I don't know.
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
Yes he is.
It hasn't been that simple so far.
This is supposed to be salvation?  What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here?
All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
Very good indeed.
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
How lucky we are.
But you said they were always old.
What did I do?
We need to talk.
Their den?  Have you ever seen anything like this?
They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing.  It may be tight.
I'll have to.
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
Why?
Do you love her?
I do, actually; very much.
How many cattle?
Where do you go next?
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
We don't have a relationship.
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
Maybe I should call Janine.
That's a terrible thing to say.
Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
Command me, lord.
Yes, the scourge --
I command you.
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
You were the one who got me in.
I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were you digging the hole?  And please remember that you're under oath.
Hello, Venkman.
That's it?  "I'll be back?"
It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
So far so good.
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Does it have any favorites?
And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
You finished here?
Are you all right?
Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
What?
Uh-huh.
I think I should spend the night here.
I want to help you.
He is the Destructor.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
That is one speedy mutt.
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
What's that got to do with it?
Die in what sense?
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
Can I help you?
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
Circle?
Yes.  I don't like this.
What on earth gave you that idea?
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
What do you mean "bad?"
I agree.
All right.  I'll try.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
Ray -- Something's here.
Where are you, Pete?
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
Who was the architect?
It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
For the gods, spit it out!
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried...
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus.
The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the eldest God of Rome.  God of my ancestors.
I would venture, with all respect: the Emperor's health is the business of every soul in the empire.
You know our two most senior Senators:  Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
The Senators admire you.
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
Quintus is overly idealistic.
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
You teach them!
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
Death is a very light thing for you.
Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions!  I'm proud to have you in my school!  Now, show them what you can do!
Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
So, things change.  The government has moved to the circus.  You're going to fight last.  And Commodus is going to fight first.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Aren't you eating?
I want to go home.
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
What is the matter?
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
-- really incredible --
Come in.
Because -- I am.
I don't understand --
I don't know.
Is that so? You might marry me?
You a student?
You heard me. Out of here.
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
The Singleman party, sir?
Yes sir?
Is anything wrong, sir?
Where is it?
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
How are you, Benjamin?
Is there an ashtray in here?
Oh my God.
It's all right.
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
Her portrait?
I think I'll go to bed.
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
Where is it?
Jesus Christ!
That's fine.
Well -- do you want to go up first?
Benjamin.
What?
Thank you.
You what?
Is this -- what?
Are you kidding?
On your first time --
Who said it was my first time?
I walk out.
Always?
Right.
About five years.
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
I don't.
Don't tell Elaine.
Yes.
Why are you asking me all this?
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
Don't talk about Elaine.
Yes.
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
You're not.
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
If that's how you feel --
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
But if it's sickening for you --
Yes. Please. I want you to.
This is absurd.
Thank you.  Benjamin --
What have you done to her?
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Braddock -- Braddock?
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Nothing else.
I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
You believe me, don't you?
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
To be what?
No.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
Ben, can I say something to you?
What?
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
Why?
HUH?
It's Benjamin.
It's a short life and a gay one...
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
No --
You can't.
I'll pay you back.
I have an idea working in my head... 
You might find a bullet through that head...
You?
No -- why? -- should I?
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
You're very funny --
You were very different yesterday.
Nothing -- only to be here.
Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
Why do you look at me like that?
So alone.
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
What can you see?
And?
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
That's a silly joke.
Shall I see you again?
Oh -- yes but -- later.
I can't.
Why?
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
What?
If we could scare up some men to play.
Ready, Kringelein?
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
Well -- last night was not so good.
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
The war.
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
The night clerk has already gone -- you are late.
I don't know.
This gentleman can have my room.
The Grand Hotel.
There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably. 
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
No - absinthe.
You like music?
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
What's the matter?
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
Tired?
Movies?
That's from skiing.
Skiing? 
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance. 
Well -- you want me?
Well?
Well?
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
I had to arrange about the trip.
You're sweet.
Come here. 
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
All right.
No water -- What a place!
You've decided against the merger?
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
Shall I tell them again?
Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --
Oh, come, Madam -- please come. 
Madam has slept well?
Oh, yes, Suzette.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
Hurry, Suzette.
I wish to be alone.
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --
Gru -- you are positively radiant.
I could not think of not accepting.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
What you need is some relaxation.
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
I want to keep my teeth.
Your what?
You're calling the shots.
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
Roy? He's always crying.
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that.
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
What? He's going to be all right!
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
It's not your fault.
That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
Perk, remember?
Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
So what's your story today?
Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track.
Lucky? You call that lucky?
Expecting visitors?
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
Uh-huh.
Never.
If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
Roy?
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
That's just Lilly's way.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
I thought these people were broke.
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
Yeah?
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
What?
Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever.
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
Ate the gun. Oh.
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
Well, when you put it that way.
Carter.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
What are you doing here?!
I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
It's John, isn't it?
Hey, you alright?
There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...
Shane's going as a condom.
BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
Shit, Linda!
You're so easy...
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Is Tim there?
Whatever happened to women in back?
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!
Promise?
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
What should I do?
God, what's wrong with him?
Halloween.
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Samhain.
No one.
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
Miss me, baby?
Used to be against the law, didn't it?
I suppose.
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
I've been looking at motorcycles.
Really?
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
I didn't know we had any women left.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
So, kid--how they hanging?  Or don't you say that to a little kid?
Everybody thinks that.
The posies are for her?
You've come to the right man.
I forget mine for years on end.
What an awful sound!
I just want one true adventure before I die.
Fifty years?
Do you know who Wanda June is?
Where's Mom?
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
She met him at college.
College!
What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
Oh hell.
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
Mhravitch.
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
Will you go to bed?
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
What kind of exercise?
That's a rifle you have?
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway.  You don't know me.  You don't know her, either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You talk to everybody just the same.
I'm talking to you gently now.
Sir?
What's the matter?
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
What's that all about?
Say hello to your mother.
You're wrong.
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
That's what you're supposed to say.
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
And what is his most cherished possession?
Why not?
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
Gentlemen--that's nice.
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
You've been bitten by bats?
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that?
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
I see.
My violin is avenged!
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
No!
Get up.
Thank you--for my life.
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
Leave the rifle here.
You don't know?
And you went home unannounced, too?
Alice got married again.
So long, you guys.
Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
Don't worry about it.
Kid--kid--
Thank God!
Don't touch me.
No.
I know.
Oh, Paul--
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
He's alive!
If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
Thank you, kind sir.
Father's friend.
What's his name?
That's why I'm crying.
It is an emergency, isn't it?
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
I know.
I see.
Yeah.
Is he coming home?
I'm sorry.
You're saying no.
You were wonderful.
Take plenty of cigars.
The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
As long as he keeps out of the park.
What kind of a life is that?
I'm amazed.
Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
You fool, you fool.
Everything's going to be beautiful.
Is that a fact?
He died of a massive rupture.
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
Okay.
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
Are you sure it's all right?
Are you Niki?
Where is she?
Are you a private detective?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
No.
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
Jesus.
You know what I'm talking about.
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
You used to work at Copper Penny?
Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
Yeah.  Well, mostly.
If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
But then you'll forget about me.
Who's paying you?
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
That's like a stag film.
Hmm.
But the police...
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
Do the police want to arrest me?
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
Pretty good.
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
I hear you got money to spend.  I hear you're interested in... interesting things.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
It's a short film.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
I'm worried about Jake.
I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
Granville's looking for you anyway.
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
You are at the University, Candy?
Wait here.
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
I don't know.
Yes.
No.
Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
All right.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
Yes. Very much.
You look as if you could.
Why do you say that?
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
Oh, my. We're too late.
We'll come back in the morning.
He's stopped.
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
Did Confucius say that?
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
But they'll put me in jail.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Oh, you weren't scared.
You sure have a way with people.
Look at the stars.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
I feel giddy.
"And this too shall pass away."
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Mother.
What?
I don't care what people say.
I'm going to marry the woman I love.
Would you like a cigarette?
Does that worry you?
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
I don't know.
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
Yes, sir.
How about to slit his throat?
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Harold!
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Yes.
Well, I didn't.
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it.
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
It's almost over!!
Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
Who wards off demons.
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
I worry about you.
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
I knew those men better than you did --
"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
-- should go back. Now!
Whatcha looking at, John??
"Need" is a good, solid word.
We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
He -- loves you.
Julia's my second wife.
Lucky man.
No time for argument.
Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.
I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
No.
Oh my God.
But you said --
Wedded bliss?
Julia.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
What happened to you?
Hurting.
Good.
This is what began it.
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
She'll tell them everything...
Sure.
You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
Maybe somebody changed the lock.
Why didn't he want to sell it?
You're still blaming me.
Well?
Just soda.
You want something to drink?
Oh Christ.
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
Kirsty.
Are you O.K.?
...maybe we should never have come back.
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
Finished?
PLEASE. You're in danger.
Where are you going?
If there's a train.
Oh!
Your father told me you were working here.
Are you busy after work ?
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
Nice, Barry.
You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
Not the point.
I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
Ehh.
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
How do you know about that?
Isn't it?
It was Jan, and it was a long time after--
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
No.  We need the gig.
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --
I have all of the others.
That's what I said.
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
What do you mean, four more?
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
'Morning, Dick.
Fine.
Let's not.
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
I dunno.
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
What?
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
You really think it would make a difference either way?
I don't know.
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
We'll talk some other time.
I told you I slept with him.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
I figured it was.  Where are you?
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
You know I'm a good person.
Mmm hmm.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
Hello.
Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
Me?
Mmnn.
What do you mean?
Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
I don't want to go back.
When are you going back?
Look, we can do other things.
Laura...
Let's go home.  Okay?
What's the difference?
You know the difference.
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.
Barry said its done.
I'm going to talk to you.
Would you marry me if I was?
It's a crematorium.
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
That way.  You?
That way.
So so.  Up and down.
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
Thirteen hundred.
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
No.
The boy _died_?
There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
They do it each year.
It's beautiful.
William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
At least.
Why are you here?
I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on.
I didn't kill the watchman.
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
Never take up poker, Detective.
Corey, you _owe_ me.
Requiem acer'nam donaei-
I was nearly killed.
And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
This can't be.
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes.  To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing.
I do not think I like the sound of that.
Who?
Far away.
Finish yours?
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
Your name?
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
It can be different.  It must be.
Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
Figure she's with him?
Yeah.
We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
Where!
He knows I'm here.  How?
What are you doing here?
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
Of sorts.
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
It doesn't.
Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night?
Where were you Tuesday night?
A neighbor saw your car leave.
I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
The resemblance is amazing.
No.
This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
Seventy-five.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
Too hot?
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
Just for the first year.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
Now, that's a nice thing to say.
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
You can break it, can't you?
What do you mean by that?
Listen, Walter --
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
The insurance business?
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!
Now you're talking!
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
I'd like to think.
Is this the Community Hospital?
Murder, uh?
When did you deliver this first?
Don't tell me you were worried!
In a way.
Well -- what is it?
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
Walter, you can't do that!
Hildy, darling!
Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five miles an hour. You know what I mean?
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
I don't know --
Are you gentlemen all through with me?
You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
I call. What you got?
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it.
Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?
I'll call.
You ain't gettin' out o' here!
No -- just coffee, Gus.
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
What?
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.
Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
I won't.
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
Who is it?
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
Here!
Huh?
You know it is!
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
Very simple, Earl.
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
Quiet, Mollie!
What's the idea?
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
Is it hard?
What's he want?
That was a googly!
Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?
Give him the you-know-what.
It's true.
No, she didn't.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
Sod.
Wow!
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.
And what's that?
Why didn't they say that before you started?
You know it? It must be an old one.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
I can't do it. What's the point?
You might still have a house.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
Am I? Maybe I am.
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
Can I help you with something?
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
Yeah.
How awesome?
She looks like she stinks.
What was that?
I hope you fixed the spare like I asked ya.
Just grin and bear it.
Why are we stopping?
Hmmmmm.
The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
That's nice.
Oh.
Tickets for what?
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
Yeah?
Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
Keys.
Open up the trunk.
And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
That's it?
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.
Don't worry, we'll find her.
And?
Tell him, Harold.
As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet?
French?
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
Oui. Perfect!
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
Oui.
Yes. Happy happy.
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
We still have you and I.
My apologies, madam.
Shut up and tell me.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
Lila, it's Rosie.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
You've got to respect that.
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
How's it going?
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
Oh, and the sun block?
I don't know. Something.
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
Who is it?
That's great.
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
You just have to control it. We're not apes.
Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
You want a chaser?
Check!
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
I've never been to Louisville.
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
You know what's good for him?
Okay?
Cut.
Yeah? Why?
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
I been thinking.
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
What's that supposed to mean?
How're the hands?
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.
Please don't get off me now.
I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
Half.
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
It's quiet.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
Hello, Charlie...  C'mon in...  That's my girl.
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
Yeah, that's what I think.
How much?
When?
There it is. I'm broke.
Yeah, sure has.
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
Call it.
You quittin', friend?
What?
How long have you been waiting?
Have a nice trip?
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
I could always get us a bottle.
You told me.
You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
You got it all in your head?
When you've got money, you'll pay.
You need the words?
What do you want to tell me?
Oh, grow up.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
Well, what's the matter?
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
Game's over, Eddie.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
I don't know.
Yes.
Yes.
Need some gas?
Hell of a night.
If we want it, it is.
Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
Jim -- what's wrong?!
It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
What did it look like?
What, Jim, what?
Where's your car?
What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
Why?
Behind my house, up on the ridge.
I swear it was here.
Does it look to you like anything landed here?
Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.
Who are you calling?
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
Oh?
What's his family background?
You have to leave the White House.
I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
What're you talking about?
Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
Dad, don't start.
Can't this thing go any faster?
What the hell is that?
Pops, you're a genius!
But Mr. President...
And our troops here?
How do you know?
It's doing what?
He's trying to impress you.
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
What?
I thought you didn't recognize me.
I don't need it.
What the hell's going on?
I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Yes.
Yes.
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
What has the old fool got himself into now?
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
Where did this come from?
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
DONOVAN!
My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
My room!
What do you know about this place?
All I have to do is squeeze.
I never expected to see you again.
All right Dad -- tell me.
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
You left just when you were becoming interesting.
Ready?
I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
I'll take the camels.
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
Just a routine inspection tour.
Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
Who?
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.
You understand what he tells us?
Step on it, Short Round!
Indy?
Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
Indy, look!
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
Why they glow like that?
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
It is why Krishna brought you here.
Long ago -- before my father's father.
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.
God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
A what...?
Don't let it pull you deeper!
Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
I'd like to find one of those myself.
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
Not leftovers?
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
What?
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
And they don't even know what it really is.
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
Arrrgh!
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
...I need to make a phone call.
My place, can't you see?
Quit screwing around, this is important.
You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
Yeah.
Behind us?
I wouldn't say that.
I did. I brought you back here.
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
She's...pretty fast.
What do I do?
Where is she staying?
What?
Rene...
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
I feel like an idiot.
Even Rene?
She's the toughest to read.
You're doing great with her.
Not her. You!
What is it?
What if she says something important?
She's got the most beautiful...s
Some agent you are.
Where are you going?
...drink it.
What?
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
I've got an idea.
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
While he makes the run.
Do it.
Are you alright?
Holy...
He aready made the deal..
The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
Never mind that, where are we now.
Now, you're too suspicious.
It'll remind me of you.
What is your name?
I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..
Impossible.
Surveillance Cameras?
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
It may have been affected.
Oh.
You may not remember things.
What things?
Remember what?
Here?
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
Not...complaining, actually.
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
Now you know what I know.
I said...I didn't say..anything!
Oh...and who is it!?
What do you do about what?
The poet...something he said...
Dinner...tonight.
Me still. They left you alone?
It's not apparent.
As if your mind's not all there.
Why do you do it?
Who do you work for?
How often they come here?
Who did?
I'm sorry. What will you do?
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
He must be a good friend.
What is it?
Then why are you smiling like that?
What's Gruner like?
How?
What?
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
This going to work?
Now what?
Why not, what are you going to do?
Who are you? Who do you work for?
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
It was you.
Riuji?
Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
You can't take that.
It's alright.
Yes.
Yes.
So we better get started.
Mom.
Let me tell you something, Lowell. Look, look, look. You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville. I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX! I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A.  Alright? When I get a chance, I'll give it a look...
Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
We'll give you a heads up before we launch.
P.J.'s.
Monday.
Are you all right?
Sure.
I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night...  Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...
What the hell are you doing?
So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again.  As they start to leave...
If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
Hey, Lowell.
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
What do you need at the store?
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
Use the bathroom.
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
Area code 212-555-0199.
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
Did I get you up?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
Yes.
No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
ABC...?
You greased the rails!
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
What do you mean there is no family?
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
Right.
You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
Chapter and verse.
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
Who's the pigeon?
Who do you want me to kill?
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
You're calling me a pestilence? That's a hoot!
Objection, your honor!
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
Why in God's name would I want...?
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
Is she Asian?
Asian? No.
I have it.
My God.
Yes?
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
You said 'yes' didn't you?
It sounded like a bell.
These are yours.
"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
Your mother was.
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
Miles? You're scaring me.
May I come in?
What do you want?
That's blackmail.
No buts. Now. Out.
Hello Marylin.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
Sweet.
He never even asked. He just assumed --
Of Massey Myerson?
Every week --
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
Wait. I know you.
Excuse me?
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
...arty farty!
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
Did Marylin end up with money?
You know what I mean when I say "it."
I don't know. I can assume...
She always looked out for me.
Video.
What are they?
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in
And this is what you wantthirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
Yes, I knowbut
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourselflong ago.
Where are you taking me?
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
I knocked several times.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
Nothing. 
Well!
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
She hasn't had a thing yesterdayor today.
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that
What do they say?
Amateurs!
What happened to your money?
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.
My ticket?
That's right. You didn't.
What for?
Here, boy!
Of course I do. What do you mean
Darn clever, these Armenians.
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
Hurry up and get dressed.
Um. You're doing all right.
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
Next week "East Lynne."
I better go over and see her.
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old womana trip like this.
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
Aren't you afraid of me?
You're crazy.
This looks like the best spot.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
What's the matter?
Here. Eat your head off.
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
Raw?
What if nobody stops for us?
Amazing.
Eat a carrot.
Any luck?
That's swell!
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
Better go back to your bed.
I hope you got your money.
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
SorryI didn't mean to
I'm hungry.
I said, the old man's screwy!
The dame's too smart for him.
Up yonder. See the lights?
Mr. Gordon
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that
Wait a minute, GordonI
Who's she gonna marry?
I'd put you there myself.
Mebbe.
See that. They're gone!
Yeah.
Well, you're two up on me now. 
Huh?
Wife?
Yeahwouldn't it?
Where do you live?
Orange, New Jersey.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
William Walter, the night clerk on duty here in the FBI office, gave me a copy of this.  It went all over the country.  Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this wasn't even mentioned in the Warren Report!  Read it, Al.
Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
Street cats?
What was his voice like?
And Oswald?
Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
What do you think, Lou?
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming.
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
I did.
No, I did not.
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
...give me protection?
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
No, I never saw him before in my life.
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
And Shaw?
Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
I had the cause of death.
I'm sorry.
A Willie O'Keefe?
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
David Ferrie.
I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
What?
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it.
How many men?
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?
Well, thanks for coming.
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
Even my own wife, chief,  Who's wondering where I am?
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
A bit.
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
My pocketbook.
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
How was your flight?
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
You gain weight?
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
He's the one who wants you.
Cash poor?
The Delfonics.
How'd you find that out?
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
Does it happen to all men?
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
What're you, a bag lady?
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
You think he's got a thing for you?
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
Has he hinted around?
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
You're rationalizing.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
Tell him you want to see him?
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
Did you tell him you were leaving?
Madrid or Barcelona?
He sells guns.
You ever see him sell guns?
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
Was she there?
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
There was a guy with Melanie?
We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
What about me?
He said he didn't know about it.
You think I'm kidding?
They asked.
What do you think it is?
Yeah.
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
Who?
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
I'll give ya ten.
Plus the same deal as before.
I can sit through it once.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
When did you get out of jail?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
Yeah.
So where did you go?
Where were you?
Uh-huh?
I'm going to wait in the car.
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
Whatcha watchin'?
Guess where I am?
I know you don't know. I said guess.
The moon -- I dunno
Uh-huh.
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
Who was that?
What's your relationship?
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
So you're sure she's dead.
In the chest and stomach.
Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
What?
How am I supposed to know that?
Cops can't locate him, huh?
Getting there.
Do you know what he's on probation for?
The bond for possession is only a thousand.
Somebody already did.
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
Brown, Jackie Brown.
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
Winston found you.
All I did was walk out with it.
This place stinks.
That I gotta see.
Have her bring the money here.
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
He leave town?
What are you then?
Let me out of here!
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
I see.
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
There's nothing to expose.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.
Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
A bit.
She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
But I see them.
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
Whataya mean, no record?
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
I don't want to know.
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
Go to sleep.
I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
Where is the lamp?
What do you think?
What happened to you?
No. Have you seen my glasses?
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
I must have been out of my head.
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
I'm going home.
'Cause she's always on your mind.
What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
Coming here?
That's your decision.
I can't do it.
Lie down!
Am I home?
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
While you were in the shower.
Stay away from me, Jez.
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
It might be for me.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
I promise.
Where have they gone?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
Shows how much you knew.
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
One drop?
No. I couldn't.
I no from around here.
How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
He'll never make it.
Push 'em back.
I'm awake?
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have put on twenty pounds.
Count 'em on one hand.
Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams.
The army?
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
Duck fuckers?
It's locked!
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
The hull's imploding!
Kay-Em!
Goodbye, my love.
I am an expert!
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.
I'm with you kid.
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Outta here?
Rizzo, he's out there.
His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.
Okay, good tip.
I think I had some when I was eight.
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
I...I don't know what I did...
Close the fucking door!
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
You're so bossy.
Robot huh?
No...  That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
You killed him?
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
Am I in there?
Do I have to?
I missed you too.
I'm sending you the files.
Jason? He's on this ship?!
They can deal with this sort of thing.
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
You got it.
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
I know who he is...
It's my charter. My party.
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
Do you see the kids?
Be careful.
You too, sweetheart...
Only 24 hours!
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
What's that?
What do we do?
Why don't we just tow it in?
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
You here for the summer?
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.
My husband tells me you're in sharks.
Is that a boat?
Transplants?
Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means.
Anti-Shark cage.
What's that supposed to prove?
Gettin' ready to run again -- no? No?  What's he playin' here?  Put the gloves on!  Let's see who's gonna tease who now!
I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark.
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
Follow him!
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
You know how I feel about her.
Cool.
Really? What are they like?
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
We could get back together too.
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
What a trip, man.
What? I'm not made of stone.
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck.
I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.
Yeah?
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
Cute?
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
You've never been to a dance, have you?
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
But you're old!
Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
Your name, please?
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
I sort of already have.
Either I just pissed my pants or...
Only the one in my pants.
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
You're not listening to me.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
Hold still.
...Anything else?
...That's not true.
...I don't know.
What's wrong with her?
Not so good. You sure you have to?
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
Can't hurt.
Who?
Dahlia, no.
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
Sure.
By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
Ya see what I'm sayin'?  Ha!
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.
I still think we should have met them first.
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
Any word from that gallery?
Where's Adele?
...Janitor's job.
With how many people?
But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
What do you mean?
I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.
What for? That guys a dick.
You think?
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
Man, this guy is really good.
Oh. You like her?
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
That.
So.
Good luck?
Yo, you got any weed around here?
Nah.
Casper.
Right here.
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
Yeah. Come on.
At the block party?
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise.
Do you care about me?
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
What?
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
Everything is wrong.
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
Telly says was up.
You still mad at him?
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
Do you know where he went?
Who, Benny's little sister?
I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
Yeah.
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
I hate 'em.
Yep.
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
By yourself?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
Morpheus.
Are you crazy?
The door was open.
Then let's narrow it down.
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
You still having a problem with this?
I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
Hello, Peter.
What?
It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know.  Just how close I'm getting? Well, I'm closer than you think, pal -- and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
Hello, Peter.
I've figured out the message.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
You might not have done it had you known.
Feeling better?
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
Uh huh.
Has he gotten through to any?
He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
What do you think he did?
I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
Another one?  What word did he leave?
As large as castles.  You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
In a way.
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
No.  You were talking about chess.
It was.
I just don't want to fight with you.
This frightens me -- because I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time.
Fine.
Hi.
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
This letter.  I've never opened it.
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
Have they harmed you?
I don't know how.
Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
There is nothing.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
No. She must agree of her own free will.
Never.
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
She can see the Beast!
Use your sword.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
I cannot betray my bride.
What business?
I have need of friends.
And where do you lead, boy?
To the place where Death lives.
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
My heart stays here.
Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
No.
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
You do?
I only want one.
We meant only to please you.
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
We have plenty of hares.
Passable, pimple, very passable.
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
You were attacked in the forest?
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
Knowledge I wouldn't want.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
You see?
You will come with me.
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
No.
...What?
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
The fat man down there, on the bench.
It's incredible! How did you do it?
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
Mathilda?!
...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
Where are you going?
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
I love you so much, Leon.
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
...Composer.
...Who sent you?
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
I don't accept that.
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
What if you don't make it?
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
Ellen?
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?
What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.
I know where my heaven is.
If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
Perhaps there's another route?
What are you saying?  This story is too big for this paper?
They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
Yes.
I'm walking there Kris.
What Mr. Parker?
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
You're in pain.
Hello.
Are you working?
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
Me neither.
Sera... what you don't understand is...
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
Why?
What was that all about?
I don't understand any of that.
I like it here with you.
What did they look like?
How much, do you think?
Where have you been staying?
Yuri... are you...
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
No. I was in the shower.
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
Dewey Newcomb?
Huh?
Thank you.
You're hitting on me?
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
I'm sorry?
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
No!
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
Good one.
How'd it go at the trial?
You can't go home!
Relation?
I'm her sister.
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
I know. He has it sent out.
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
You're pawning The Rock?!
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.
And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.
What the hell is that for?
So now you're -- ?
Oh, my God!
I got bangs!
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
Amazing how?
Your what?
I completely agree.
Then what? My boobs are too big?
Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
She's naked.
We watch... good fun...
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
I like well what I see.  It pleases me.
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
And, now?
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
It's terrible.
Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.
Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
But... but, why?
Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
There it be, lad.  The Lindfarne Mound.  Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep.
Pregnant, is she?
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
I should hope not!
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
Wait, Jack.
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
Water doesn't burn...
And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
The wound is mortal.
What weapon?
And did you?
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
Sport, indeed.
What shall we do?
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
Are you honest?
Where are you going?
What happened?
They tricked you.
He did run?
I have no wife.
What have I done?
Sunlight... It destroys him.
So, he's hiding in the dark...
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
Pinching me!
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Step lively now!
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
What care the bones when the soul is free?
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
Can you show us the way?
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
Do you guys feel like painting?
What are you doing up so early?
You're a good girl.
My mother would die.
I don't want you to!
We're not gonna do anything.
Does everything have to have a point?
Josh said...
You'd hate him for the trick.
He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
Right...she married...what was he?
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
Forty.
Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
Thank you.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
You're here early today.
This has got to stop!
I'll ask.
To check up on me?
I'm not going!
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
I hate turkey.
It bugs me.
I don't beg.
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
Sit down for a second.
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
I'll have to pay him back.
Hi, Alyssa.
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
Getting high, I guess.
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
Can you build a house in four months?
Left you this place.
Because Dad left?
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
I want him with me.
What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
Which?
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
Finished or unfinished?
Do you need anything?  I'll go to the pharmacy.  I have some Demerol at home.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
What did he say?
You got any weed?
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
I can't go right now.
We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
Hey.
Do you know anything about building a house?
Why?
A night in the hole?
We get the games on the radio sometimes.
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
No, but...
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
Married?
Yes, boss.
I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only.
Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
I know it begins with a "C"...
Start your job? What kind of job?
A loan officer?
That's right, a loan officer.
Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
There is no Boom-Boom Room.
Yeah, I want some pie.
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
What are you talking about?
Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
So?
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
What do you want, Claude?
Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --
At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
What'd you say?
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
Crop duster.
Well, if that's the way it is...
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
I can't eat this.
Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
You got your own nightclub?
Why ain't his pick swinging?
Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments.
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
All in, boss!
Move it out.
No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.
Mama?
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
Is this a joke?
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
Release the evil?
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
This is bad, Nicky.
That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
That's a pretty brassiere.
You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
Look who's back from the dead.
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
Hey.
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
Yes...
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
I love you.
Off limits.
A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
Hey...
All right -- what are you?
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.
Answer the question!
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect.  I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
Of course.
Where do you live, Mary?
No.
I changed my mind.
And now?
About what?
I'm not armed.  Well?
K.
Why tell me?
I let him go... believe me.
Of course --
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
Don't!
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
I don't think so.
Why not?
No.
How'd the camera get so high like that?
As best we can.
You recognize that guy?
You know what I think?
Can I call you?
Hi.
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
So what do we do?
What's he do?
How'd it happen, Alice?
I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay?
Have you made any charges against him?
No.
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
A headache?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
There's no other bedroom?
My... My head.
I like to laugh, Fred.
It must be from a real estate agent.
Good book, huh?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
You're up early.
So?
But...
It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
What job?
Was there?
The heart, I guess.
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
Whatiya mean?
You still care about me?
What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
No... I told you.
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
What's the BITCH'S name?!
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Sheila... Stop...
Oh, read it!
Fossils, huh?
A paleontologist.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
I beg your pardon.
Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
There you are!
They were in a quandary, and
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Think of it! In times like these.
Huh?
Gold. You were going to
Cave, eh? Where?
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
Oh, I'm so glad.
Oh, immediately.
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
You're lying, aren't you?
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago  you're still alive, Father Perrault!
You?
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
He's dead.
What's it mean?
I don't know.
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!  George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
A man whose life was empty!
Yes, I know.
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
Why?
I was just going to.
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
They don't?
Only the damn guy won't know it.
Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware.  Be safe.  Have a good day.  Oh, uh... Cowan?
Mikey.  Hold it, Mikey-- I want you to talk to me.  Mikey.  I'm telling you.. don't make me... Mikey   Gimme the 140.
I wasn't scared...
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
What?  Who the hell are you?
This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
Gee.  You really think?
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
Do his job.
Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.
Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
What is it?
What do we do?    Lean into it.
Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?
... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
How'd you know that?  Kay?
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
What?
He'll turn around.
The other two will die without me.
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
Just some guy... they found.
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
You don't remember me, do you?
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
You the only sentry?
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
What?
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
Really?  You've never been inside?
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.
You gonna tell on me?
I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
What happened?  Where's the rest?
Rufus, play it back...
I forgive you...
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
Kill me!
You don't seem all that proud.
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
What safe place is that?
Where?
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
How do I even know which one has it?
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
I thought you were retiring?
The guy from USA Today is here.
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
I don't understand --
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
I wanna kill my boss.
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
That was our apartment.
Since right after we lost our son.
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
You know I need to use you.
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
You're Bobby, right?
Yeah.
He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
No thank you.
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
I can take you down there.
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
As far as...?
He's great, right. Is he great?
I know.
Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
It's a poison arrow tree frog.
Oh my god. What happened?
No coke tonight.  Right?
Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
I never promised you anything.
But what about them?
I said no touching.
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
5-5-1.
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
Ricky's taken care of.
I got a way we make everybody happy.
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
Nah.
'Trustafarians?'
It's not losing record.
Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number.
Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you.
We look good this year.
How'd you unlock my phone?
No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
I'm not taking her to a bar.
Is that the woman from..?
What's the movie?
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
Nothing.
So they said more than the address.
Don't even start.
You know this guy?
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
Back in.
You got that right.
He wants to see us now.
Did you hear what he just said?
All the more reason.
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
Eighty five.
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
It's gonna be fine.
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
We rep lines? You know? Fashion?
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
And where is...?
Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
Coke?
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
Ricky.
You know my pager number?
Yes. You're going to New York.
No. I'll take a strega.
She poured it for --
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
No...
Who's gonna outfit us?
I am.
What they call you?
When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
Where can I get a hold of you?
Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.
You're a damn liar.
I'll give you back the 600.
The dirty yellow rat bastard.
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
Don't con me. Don't try...
What? Everybody knows God is White.
But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
I can't.
You are now Benjamin 2X.
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
What?
Let's talk about you for a change.
I can handle it.
I know.
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.
Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
Please, go ahead.
"His greatest greatness."
I better not come in.
I know where you're going.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
Did you hear me?!
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
Might be all right.
You want to be the head man?
Watch your tongue, boy.
He told you that?
Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
[Why?]
Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
Where does he live?
[Who pays you?]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[Drive.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[Yeah.  Yes.]
[Yes. Many times.]
Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
I'm here.
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
So what's wrong?
How long you staying, Crease?
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
I came to visit you.
No.
Potential? I don't understand.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
Not at all?
Hmmm?
So you were unhappy?
What are you doing?
No.
It's better to be free, right?
They'll be back in a week.
Well, it's a sort of wife.
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
The blocks.
You think too much?
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
How are you getting along with Pinta?
For an American she understands this country very well.
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
[I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
I can take care of myself.
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
You want me to ride down with you?
All right, I'll see you!
We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.
I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
Well, he died. You know who else died?
Well, it ain't your baby.
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
Marty.
Were the lights on?
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
Are you kidding?
I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
Put on your blue suit...
You not ugly.
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
Waddaya mean, Ralph?
That's swell, Missus Fusari.
Well...
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
What do you want me to do?
What are you going to do with him?
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!
I don't believe it's right for you to involve a boy who's not seventeen years old yet...
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
When will he be able to write?
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
A-negative. I've cross-matched it.
Black capsule.
I don't feel anything.
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
What's the matter?
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
But I'm married.
Something else we have in common.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
Of course not.
It was really nice of you to take me along.
He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.
The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
You don't go after the local scrunch?
Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
What's wrong with him?
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
First decent idea you've had in a month.
Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
O'Reilly!
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
Never mind.
Nice.
You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann.
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Hello, John.
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
A third party?
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
That's your father's diary, Ann.
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
John Doe.
A deal?
Duets? But can we trust him?
And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific!  No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.
I ain't seen him for a week.
He's watching the other door.
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
Go out and find her!
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there
Both of 'em?
The heelots!
Grubbel's here. See? 
It must be some kind of a gag.
I gotta figure some way out of this thing!
Hello, Mr. Connell.
Yeah. It certainly is.
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shotyou forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
That's got nothing to do with it!
Did you write itor didn't you?
Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
Flowers.
Did you want to see her about something important?
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
Uh-huh.
What do you mean, too bad?
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
I didn't see anything.
Is there a crowd in the street?
No, sir.
Dinner's on you.
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
No shit! He's good!
What's the line?
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
Don't make do it, Mike.
This has nothing to do with Walter.
It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
You can't kill me like this.
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
How are we gonna get him out of there?
I don't really like to drink.
Where did you hear that?
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
I think I can handle that one.
So what do I say to this guy?
You know why I like the track?
See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.  What do you think?
We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
That's okay. That's his style.
The jockey!
What the fuck is going on.
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
So what do you want to do?
Have you evacuated anyone?
Please. I'm begging you.
I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
Mmm, needs a little something.
How's Paco doing?
It's very nice.
You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "M" word.
Stay up there, Girl...
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
Repoed this morning.
God-Damn you!
Because I took it out of your memory.
As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
It's all here...
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
Where you plugged-in from?
Two maze runners.
What?
A hotel?
The truth.
No.
I know.
Why not?
It was just there.
Just like that?

He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
In the language of the Nathadians, "Nin" stands for "man", "jetti" stands for "animal".  Ninjetti  - man and animal, together as one.  Now, put your hands inside the flame.
I heard that!
Two thirty three a.m.
FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!
Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
Mordant, go with them and report back to me!
"Basically".
What is THAT!
That was a CHEAP shot!
Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti.
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
Charlie Luciano.
You scare me, Charlie.
When my money moves, I go with it.
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
Masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. But his patience won't hold out much longer.
How's Bugsy doin'?
Inside, they were talking of you.
Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.
It's a mask.
Have you thought about this?
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
I'm gonna lose you, Charlie.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
It'll just be a few minutes.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
You gotta plan these things.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
The kid just called me stupid.
Don Maranzano. Welcome.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
What about the share.
And the Jews?
The terms will be mine.
And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.
Where's the stiff?
But only on purpose, Tommy.
Switch hands.
Olive or eyeball?
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
Back? You're sending me back?
Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
Bitchin' good cake.
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
Can't you give it to me later?
Who?
I might wake up.
Hypnos?
How am I gonna get past the guards?
Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
Where'd he go??
Stu...Stu...
Stu...LOOK!
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
So, what do you think?
What pictures?
He seemed quite taken with you.
Mother, I ...
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
Really?
What happened?
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Yeah.
This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
This way?
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
--what possible explanation can you offer for this charge being--as you say--"trumped up" against you!
Looks like it, but--
What's he bringing pigeons for?
Positively not in the station! Gone!
Let's send out a pigeon!
Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
Tell me why!
Would you settle for a husband?
What's this, Diz?
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
How about getting married?
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
You know, we're getting married.
He's cooked! They'll drum the poor lug out of that chamber tomorrow as sure as I'm--! And now they're all down on him. Yeah--my press pals, too--he's a bad egg--still water running deep. Boloney! It's the frame of all time! When I see a phoney like this--my journalist blood boils-- I wanna *fight*!  Look, kid--rack your brains, will you? Haven't you got any confidential stuff on that mob? I'll write my arm off--I'll blow Taylor and his--
Great saints!
Dinner, Hubert.
Otis!
Emma! I'm a man at the end of his rope.
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
A dirty frame!
I *thought* I heard... Yes?
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
Mr. President!
For a question!
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
--I may not know much about a lot of things, sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you, Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why, there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the--
Will the Senator--
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
Certainly would, Joseph.
What is it?
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
What's that?
What?
We're over in the House.
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
No.
No! Stop it!
No--
What do they--? Who are all those--?
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
Second drawer.
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
A camp! Well!
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
What do you mean? What's going on?
You can't find it in racing forms, Chick.
Let's get away from here. 
I know that.
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
Look, Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this, wouldn't they?
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
Do you?
That'd be a crime--after all this work--getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nice as you please-- approved--all ready to roll--
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
How nice.
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
Mr. President...
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
He's still pixilated.
Yes!
NO!!
Look, this is my house. I'd like to
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
That depends on what they see.
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
Oh, that
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
What did he play?
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
No, I don't mind.
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
No. It's nothing.
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
Did it?
Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.
John
But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is
You try it.
Gold, eh?
I'm not interested in the newspapers.
Yeah. A glorified doormat.
Look!
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
No, thanks.
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
Have a drink?
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
What about your knocking off for lunch?
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
Yes, sir.
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
Yes?
A what?
Who are they?
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
Prairie? Oysters?
Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
I did what!
Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
Why, that's an echo, sir!
Mr. Cook.
Uh-huh.
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
You're the shrink, aren't you?
What's that?
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
Where's your wife, Henry?
We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
What brought this on?
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
I've had my moments.
Althea hasn't told you?
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
I'm sorry, your honor.
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.
Doc...
Got a license?  But no car?
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
Can you help Mom?
What's happening here?
No.
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
We don't discuss it.
Please... forgive me.
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
No.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
Either one.
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
Of course.
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
I'm glad.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
I don't follow you.
Transference.
Hello?
I guess you saw the show...?
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
Will you be here?
Where was this?
What do you want me to see?
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
What happened today?
What'd he say?
Really?
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
A doll?
It's not?
Who else knows?
Everybody has a story, Skip.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
How'd you do it?  The new you.
I've never brought anyone down here before.
Really?
Lily.
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
Who the hell are these guys?
Altar boys?
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
Where's your new friend?
The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
The sun turning black.
No women allowed.
Proceed!
Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
You called me your girl?
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
I'm your sister.
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
Do you really think he'll show up?
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
I found it, Evy! I found it
That thing gives me the creeps.
Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils?
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
I know you knew I'd know.
The jig is up, Casanova. I've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to.
I thought you were done?
Our guests are waiting.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
We could really use some coffee --
He was cute though.
Eat your mustard.
He's dead.
He'll never make it.
I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
Ummm.
They always call the great ones nuts.
You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
Really?
How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
I'm not that kind of girl.
Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
Me, too.
It's me.
What are you talking about?
You're the Sphinx.
But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
But there's still only six of us.
So what else has Superman got?
Cover me!
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
Roy --
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
It is?
Sorry.
And a social life.
Where am I going?
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
What do you mean?
Where are they?
Well, Belliard, what's this?  What are you doing here?  Where is the enemy?
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
But who made this treaty?
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
Yes, sir.
Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.
Thank you, sir.
When did it start?
It is the work of incendiaries.
Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.
But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army...
No -- not as a rule.
What's your name?
No... nothing at all.
Not even the slightest hint of something?
The important thing is to find the right lawyer.  One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
Were any of them married?
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
All right -- I promise.
What are you doing in there?
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
Will you be joining us, soon?
Yes!!
But you will not... be safe...
Who is it?
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
That's all I can say.
Yes.
I wrote it.
What?
I couldn't face telling you.
You mean you heard them making love?
How did you know it was Captain Charles?
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
That is correct.
I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
What I am talking about is moderation.
Is he alone?
Come in.
I know Alexander.  His imagination must be struck by some great, bold, powerful stroke, and he will come back to me, just as he did at Friedland.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
You paid cash?
It's cool, but where's the water?
Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
Why you say that?
What you mean talk to her?
I ain't trying to rob you...
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
Man, this a cool house.
Go on and make yourself at home.  I'mma go get dressed for work.
She pepper-sprayed me, man!  She pepper- sprayed me!
I can't taste nothing.
Damn, you got a stalker.
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
You walked?
What's the matter?
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
Oh yeah, why you walking?
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
You did all this for me?
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
Next time, page me first.
You alright?
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?
See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you.
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
Roach...Roach, come on.
'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.
What?!  What that mean?
Get 'em, Craig!
I got fired too.
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
Hey, what's going on?
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
Elroy.
Where'd you come from?
Somebody close?
My security people are right next door.
I have a problem.
There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
Daddy?
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
Let me talk to her again.
No.
I want'to talk to her.
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
Keep it.
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
That's right.
What are you supposed to do?
One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
Yeah.
What are you going to do!?
Hey!
What?
Where are we going?
I'm not a baby.
You're a big girl, huh?
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
I'm looking for them.
And what happens if I don't call you?
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
What'd I say?  What? What? What? What?
Leavin', boy?
Do you mind me cussin', boy?
AAA-MENN!
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Just went?
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
What could have possessed that girl!
Satan.
I burned it.  I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
How?
I tried to save her.
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
John...
Hm?
It's all here.
To see Dad?
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
I'm hungry, John.
John, where's your folks?
Where ye from?
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
Don't you believe me?
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.
Yes; John's bad.
John's bad.
Can I have this?
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?
She took them kids with her?
I been bad!
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
What'd you all talk about?
What the hell are dreams, anyway?
Oh my god, oh my god...
No.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
Bring him out of what?
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
How you doing, pal?
You used me, daddy!
Decide to take a day off after all?
Just want to talk to him a second.
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
Great
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
Okay... You need anything, just call.
And then what happened?
What the hell you doing here?
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
Well, here are fifty francs.
Bring me forty-five back.
Aren't you late?
I have nothing to hide.
When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.
An evening gown.
No, that's not him...
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
Comrade Buljanoff...
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
The former Duchess!
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
Good morning, Your Highness.
A blue shirt, perhaps?
Have you?
And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
Is this satisfactory?
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
And if we have to go to Siberia...
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
What's that?
Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame.
You want me to go in there?
Pardon me, I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?
But you had!
Oh no. No visa.
You're going to force us... huh?
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Me?
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
That's a strange angle.
Is this what you call the "butler"?
He takes good care of that.
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
Wounded? How?
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
Then how did you get here?
Must one always be after something?
No.
Not funny, huh?
I don't look too foolish?
She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
But, darling, you can't do that.
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
All right, we'll make it red.
I know... it's the Russian soul.
Radio! What is radio?
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look.
It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
Make it ice cold.
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
Yes.
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
I must insist that you leave.
I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
Here, please...
Thank you.
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
The future of the common people.
It's just a place for workmen.
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
My jewels?!
We could check the tape again, sir.
How's the job coming, Bob?
You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John.  It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...
He's right.  Maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, John.  A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate.  What do we have to hide?
Why me?
Mitchell?
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
He wants money.
The soldiers were provoked.  The students started it, for Christ's sake!
No, you didn't, Bob.
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
May I say something, Mr. President?
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ...
Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us.
What?
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
Because they're not Americans.
... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate.
What about the documents he promised?
I can't ...
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
What about happiness, Mother?
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
What?
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
... little Bobby.
I never met the man.
He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
How the fuck did you know?
Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
Howard ... What the hell?  What're you doing?
Fuck it!  He doesn't like me, John!  It's your fault, Henry.
I beg your pardon --
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
Why?
But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.
You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
You're the one who should be in politics, John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack.
Edgar, wonderful to see you.  Clyde ... hi.
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
Compassionate.  Grateful.
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
It's over, Dick.
This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
He looked old, didn't he?
I've missed you.
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
What?
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
'Predate it.
That man that shot you died in prison.
Yes, you've circled round.
How come're you doin that?
You're discouraged.
I'm... discouraged.
...I don't know what I do feel like.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
Hard to believe.
Nothin'?
Yes ma'am?
We goin' in?
So when was he here?
Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.
You gonna drive out there?
I mean, would you care to join me.
I need to know that.
Llewelyn --
You should be used to that.
Yessir?
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
How'd you find it?
Airport.
Yeah. I know where you're going.
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
With what?
What time do you close?
Well... I need to close now --
Yes.
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
How's that?
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
You on all night?
Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em.
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
Okay.
What do you want to know?
You want to change rooms?
Not that way.
So was I.
The heroin. You don't have it.
No I don't have it.
I don't know. American citizens.
I got an overcoat on.
Yes sir. Two tours.
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
It wasn't a woman.
...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
You're lying!
We think we know where Betty is.
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
I know that...
Well, do something, then, damnit!
Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!
That's a nice name for what you need...
What about it?
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
"Thirty-two?"
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too late.  Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back.
I'd rather not...
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
What happened when you were twelve?
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
What?
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
Make sure it's elevated...
I begged him to let me put that on!
I left my husband two days ago.
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
So why'd you come to L.A.?
No, that's not, I couldn't...
The one you were telling me about?
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
Guess who I saw today.
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
Does he know you think he's real?
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
You should have a little faith in people.
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
What?! That you had something to do with it?
More than you know. Is there anything else?
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
He told us it's in the Buick.
I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.  Never abandon you instincts.
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
I hope you're right...
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
How'd they describe her?
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
Jesus Christ!
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
Would you say she was ambitious?
Because it ain't natural, young man.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
- and share one of your graves.
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Latch right on to that tit.
Not out the other side his face, though.
Now Penny, stop that!
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
It's just a symbol, honey -
That's good, honey.
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
Well, we need that ring.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
Great ass.
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?
That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir!
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
Hi, son.
Pardon?
I called you Sarge.
Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
Yes I do!
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
You what?
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
He ask you out for next weekend?
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
Seriously.
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
You're better than candy.
I don't want you to move.
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
You're welcome.
God.
That's right.
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
Different tables.
Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
I mean it!
Everything okay?
Can we come in?
-- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five feet deep, forty-two hundred square feet, four floors with a rentable basement apartment, so five altogether, courtyard in back --
How many more do we have after this?
Why?
I don't think so, but I love her album.
No, Edgar Allen.
Too many stairs.
478...
Damn it!
What do we do?
Shaky?
Nope.
Oh, please.
Do it.
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
He'll do something.
Where is the Glucogen?
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
Uhh... I with it sister but...
Lemme see that rifle son...
What the fuck?
Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
I can't... they don't operate that way...
Inspector Brimmer
Brimmer you're fucked up...
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
Motherfucker... you stay away...
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
That's right brother... listen and learn.
You're a little old to be a school boy aren't you brother.  Cool it! You're probably not the only one they've gone after. Stall a little so they believe you're for real. Make them trust you.  Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man jumpy?
Alone...
I'm down.
Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important.
Just a kid.
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
What are you saying?
We'll all get out of here together.
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
You don't look alright.
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
You call that a compliment?
Am I one of that sort?
You don't know him very well, do you?
How did this... how did I let this happen?
You couldn't have known.
Oh?
Perhaps.
Do you see that, Colonel?
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
Did your father teach you humility?
Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
Gabriel?  Are you asleep?
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
Cheraw Falls.
Don't go in there.
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
You know what happened.
He left us.
Thirteen years...
Name five hundred.
That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.
Fall, six months at the earliest.
Your son, what did you name him?
Gray.
Remember Braddock?
Put those away.
Father, you can't let them take him...
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
Yes, but the rope might be--
I want to look around, daddy-- may I?
Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
Yes.
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
You believe in it.
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
What say, Louis?
Is there quicksand?
Jud, why am I doing all this?
But--
They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
You and this old Indian rag-man--
No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
I got eggs down here!
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
Aye, aye, sir!
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
That's your offer?  You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
You have a name, missy?
You've got sand, for a maid.
Thank you, sir.
You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
I knew it.
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.  The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?
Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
We'd best drop canvas, sir!
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?  You two weren't invited?
None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating.
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
Move!
Somewhat.
Not without my effects.
My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.
Tortuga?
Just do it quickly.
Depends.
Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien.  The nanobot has changed that.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything.
You can't mean that.
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
Facts, Dr. Nebbleman.  Facts. You've been using cryogenics to control the waste from the mouse experiment, haven't you?
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
Is that what Argon told you?
Daniel...
I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell.  I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly.  Exciting stuff.  I got to tell you, it really kept me going.
Nothing really worthwhile.
Yeah, we'll see.
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
Mouse?  What mouse?
You don't know?
We don't?
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.
Victim my ass!  You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage!  Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
Just like old times.
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
And you have him?
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
Certainly. Right over there.
That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
Will you step into the library?
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
I know that.
I poisoned him.
Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them.
Stewart!
That's ridiculous.
You're acting like a child.
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
Ah-ah-ah!
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?
Is that so?
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
I'll bite. What's the catch?
Gloria Golden?
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
Mr. Schuyler .
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
Sure.
No!
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
I beg your pardon, sir?
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
That's a lovely dress.
Yes.
Well, I've seen her pictures, and I don't think she's so hot.
Thanks, thanks.
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
My error.
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
Been where?
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Conrad.
Right.
Hey, Gallagher!
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
What did he want?
Now don't be absurd, Smith  May I come in?
I beg your pardon.
Double-strength!
Are the cars ready?
Smythe, you've been drinking.
No, sir.
What do you mean?
What?
Have you got any make up?
There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
Where'd you get this?
Isn't it great how she's resting like that?
What is that?
I told you where I was.
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
Did you do this?
How'd you know about the fire?
And where's that?
What's outside of Pleasantville?
What are you doing?
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
Lemme see that.
What's going to happen?
Just take deep breaths.
I still don't see why we're doing this.
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
No way.
He won't notice anyway.
You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
You got the admissions letter.
That was sure swell ...
No. You baked them for Whitey.
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
How?
Where are they?
You're gonna forget about me.
Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter?
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
Hello there.
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
BUD.
OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
There's worse places.
Do you have the lettuce?
Yeah ...
Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
Hey.
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
It's fine, but --
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
Hey. What are you doing?
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
Where are you?
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
Yes.
You have trouble, financial trouble?
-- you said you did.
I didn't lie.
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy --
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
Hi.
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
Oh My God.
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
...really? That's nice...are you lying?
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
....yeah....
....No....
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
Hi.
I'll see you later.
Yeah?
It's Barry.
What's that? What is that that you're doing?
I think maybe over a hundred.
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
Did you have my home phone number?
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
Why?
Yeah.
I didn't do that.
What do you mean?
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
And your Social Security number.
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
Who is this?
I'm a nice and reasonable man. I didn't do anything wrong. Please don't make me hurt you. And I'm telling you: that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that I love.....I will hurt you many, many, many times over.....because it's not right to take people's trust.
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
Sorry about that.
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
What is this?
It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE! MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN TOLEDO.
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
What happened?
Hey.
I need to talk to you for a second.
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
You have an ATM?
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
Seriously.
I know.
That's cool.
You ready?
So...did my brother call you?
I'll just see you when you get back here.
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
In part, yes.
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
Why not?
Mustn't do that, sir.
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
A man after my own heart...
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
I saw the longing in your eye --
Who's to say I did not?
I'm here.
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
And he's never once attempted escape?
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
Well?
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
And my own.
Poorly.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
As for the author... shoot him.
Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
"A habituè of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
Yes?
Don't start --
Did I frighten you?
There's something else I want from you.
Most assuredly.
A kiss for each page.
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
Not you too
I wonder sometimes.
You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down, he's a good kid. Real deep down.
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
The actor
I see. And you are in California for what reason?
Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
You needn't use that language with me
Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for you.
Why did we not know about this sooner?
He lied to me
I want blood
This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
"You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--
What are movies about?
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
Jesus
Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!
Yes.
Mank-
So, who is he? We have to know him.
Christ.
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
YOU STUPID, LITTLE MAN! HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?! I GAVE YOU MY SOUL AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT!?
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
Yes
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
Please don't ask me to do this.
Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
I think you better sit down
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
I'm Christ
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
I'm Ok.
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
How can he embarrass you?
What's up, Colonel?
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
You're a good sport, lady.
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
You want me to do what?
Answer me when I talk to you.
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
Go 'head.
How do you know? You know her that good?
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
Yeah, she's nice.
Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
You want the title shot?
Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
No, I just told you what happened.
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
I did keep an eye...
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
Whadda ya mean?
How many pounds I gotta lose?
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
It feels real good.
I can't find my ball.
No.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
Take off my pants.
Jake...
Who asked you?
I was just...
I'm not interested in him.
What?
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
That he's got a pretty face.
But Jake... I didn't say anything...
What's the matter with you?
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
Jake --
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
Are you drunk?
The kids are sleeping.
Don't make no difference no more.
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
Hey, leave the kids alone.
All right, I'll try. See you later.
What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
Oh. When are they expected home?
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
I'll bet it's been done.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
A detective's nightmare.
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
Did you ever own a saw?
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag.
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
No.
Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
I was.
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
Police?
There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
What do you need money for?
Yes.
Not yet, Jeff.
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change.
That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
How can you tell that -- from here?
Lisa, simmer down -- will you?
You mean "goodnight."
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
Homework. It's more interesting.
You'd better before you catch the disease!
What are you getting at?
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
We have all -- what?
That's a suitcase?
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
What for?
What's that?
Nobody chickened.
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
This is the edge, boy.  This is the end.
No--
You still want to go home, Moose?
You can't protect me.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
Yeah!
Shoot, Jimbo.
Well, now--
You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
Will you wait a minute?
He depended on me.
Really, Frank?  When was that?
No!
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
I'll wait for him.
Hi there.
I know.  That's why I came back.
No.  It's perpetual motion.
What?
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
Hey where'd you go?
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
Man, you're schizoid!
Isn't he schizoid?
What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for?
You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
Why?
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
I shot at one of them.
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
Things pretty tough for you at home?
Plato!
Hi.  I saw you before.
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
Where's Dawson High School?
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
Neither can I.
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
What?
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
Good evening.
A man of some travels.
Searching for a money man...
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
We sell children's toys --
Gotta be ten degrees out there.
I don't think it's negative five.
No, no --
No --
No, c'mon --
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
Yes it was all you --
Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
You motherfucker.
Nick --
Nick, I love you --
He'll kill you.
No, Nick, no --
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
They've never done a robbery?
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
He says he wants it now.
No.
No --
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
Put him in the truck.
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
You're not Nick Mason...
I shared his cell!
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
Her brother.
The hell you don't.
Five million?
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
Hey, it's... been two years --
Bring back some memories, Nick?
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you.  Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
Start singing.
You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
No, you're not.
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
Take 'em.
Where the HELL did he go?
Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. His lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray.
My what?!
You knew there were guns in here!
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
Oh.
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
Rudy, don't move --
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
Tell Ashley... I...
...for Christmas...
Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up...  Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
What? No...
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
Fine, now.
You fuckin' wish.
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
Daddy, did ya see that?
We were set up, the cops were waiting for us.
What? Nobody set anybody up.
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
How can you tell?
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
It's a scene. Memorize it.
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
Jesus Christ!
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
Wong?
Give me this fucking thing.
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
Mr. Pink?  Why?
I know.
Freddy Newendyke.
What's this guy's problem?
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
You didn't ask.
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
I'm okay.
Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
You really think we were set up?
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
How can you be so sure?
Where? Are they out in the car?
I think he's just passed out.
If we don't, he'll die.
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
Tell them to come on in.
Anybody hurt?
As far as -- Sonora?
You can't leave us here.
There's a nice boy.
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
I'll make the soap myself.
Will she be dark or fair?
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
What?
All right -- it's said!
I won't have you fighting over me.
Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
Who's Lednov?
You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us.  Think he will?
Yes.
At the ranch maybe?
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
Why?
He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
That's right, Steve.
It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.
Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him.
Don't go arguing with your teacher.
All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
What did you come back for?
How's that?
Yeah, how did you know?
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
Stop it -- stop it.
I figure we'll get along just fine.
Even women?
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
Go on. Have another try at him.
How far up the trail?
Gee, I can't.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
It's coming!
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Feel that?
Better try a little higher.
Listen to me I --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Then what are we going to do?
Oh, right.
What are you getting at, Professor?
Got a problem with that?
I don't like this, this...
Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
What?
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
She's right. We should stick together.
Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
Yours, or the turkeys?
A little bit... Give me your belt.
Father.
Would you like to see the girl?
It says, "Ray."
Did you hear?
What a bitch!
...Jenner... Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson. 3511 Clark Avenue!
Here we go again.
Hi!
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
Are you Chip Sutphin?
He goes to college with me!
Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
Hi, Hank.
Oooohhhh.
Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
Beverly! Not the Sterners!
I beg your pardon?
Who is this?
It's not fair!!
No, I don't.
I certainly was not!
State your name, please.
I do, please.
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
Mrs... Sutphin?
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
Man, that one made me puke!
What was that?
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
I'll take this instead.
Sure I do.
It's only a little way, Mr. August.
How much have you got?
About forty-five dollars.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
She's a pretty good sort.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact - I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her  to see her  to touch her  in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
But you do believe me?
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
But you have treated me that way.
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
Please - I can't explain things like this to your right ear.
Well?
She'll have to know some time.
I don't know.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
I can't find Gregory. I've been trying to find him.
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
I'd forgotten.
Tell me where Jacqueline is - we've got to find her.
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
You know where she is?
It seems right to us.
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice  that's it, isn't it?
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
I don't believe it.
She's not been here for a long time.
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
That was quick.
Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
...free-lance. You know.
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
What are these?
Videotapes.
No.
About sex?
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
Why not?
What will you do when the money runs out?
No.
Have you fantasized about me?
Why not?
I'm babbling.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
Possibly.
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
Don't do that.
Always the lawyer.
Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
Did you masturbate?
Did you confront John about the visitor?
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
Why?
Well, I'll call him when he does.
What's wrong with that?
Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
Questions about sex.
But why did you want to?
He wouldn't do that.
I feel like I do.
You are in serious trouble.
What is it?
She still is.
Oh, okay. I think I get it.
How do we start?
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
Hello.
Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
I like the way he dresses.
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
You trust him.
Look, are we going to do it or not?
Plus first and last month deposit.
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
You were prying before?
She's not property, John, she's a person. Were you just going to keep right on lying to her?
I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
OK. But late.
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
What do you want to call me at the office for?
Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
Who was she?
That you, Rog?
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY
You bet, Bert.
I've caught it once or twice.
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
When do I get to see Brad?
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
Why Janet?
With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
McKinley?...McKinley?
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
He was adopted you know.
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
Could you tell us a little about it?
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
Poor Brad.
YOUNG BLOOD
I NEED SOME
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
Do you really think so?
. . .For his own good.
F for...
Our field.
It's you we're concerned about, Janet.
She walks in beauty...
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
Well, then put him at the singles table.
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
They're just leftovers.
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
What happened to you guys?
Are you a writer too?
No, I'm an actor.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
Anything I'd know?
I can't help the traffic.
Yeah, Conundrum.
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
Whoa, why are we getting off?
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
That's what you do with every one.
How would you rate this one?
You know, you could work in a wine store.
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
So you're going to stop acting?
Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
How do you know?
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
What do you think?
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
Bathroom.
Hey, there you are.
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
That was three years ago after that first party!
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
Fucker hit into us.
What's happening?
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
I don't have to.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
Let me use your phone.
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Look at this!
You want to join us?
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
I'm having the salmon.
So what gems do you have in your collection?
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Okay. See you around.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Ken.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
So what are you up to today, Miles?
This one?
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
My ballet recital.
The same windows.
...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.
No I'm not.
It was very dark.
Do you think it's a possibility?
That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
Me too.
How do they know it's over?
Yes.
It's still making the noises. It's broken.
Oh.
Stop crying!
Okay.  So he was tall?
And three weeks.
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
She's not in an ambulance Father.
Why not?
Emmett.
They've been kind to me.
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
South of here, past Chimayo.
No hard feelings.
Where you been?
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
Where's your brother?
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
Hello, Cobb.
You've got a legitimate job.
This is a lot of money.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
It's the only place I'm happy.
What's this?
You really are a gambler.
What is it that I can't figure?
How about you?
My God, are you alright, Simone?
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument".
She'll drive herself.
There isn't one.
Even the fall from the plane?
Simone does not control my destiny.
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
Better late than never.
So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.
The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
Elaine, it's Wednesday.
Impossible.
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
How about the nudity?
Hello, Hal.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
How will you do our love scenes?
For her?
Is she here?
I was misquoted.
I need flesh and --
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
There was no other way.
If anyone asks about Simone --
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
One thing bothered me.
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
Me and Simone.  What I did.
Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
It's a yacht.
It's bogus.  You used an old library shot for the background.
The background is.
She looks a lot like you.
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
It's a hotel.
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
Good morning, Simone.
You mean they buy it?
Maybe he can.
Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
You did create me.
No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
You know what I'm talking about.
Wow. They called you their son.
All your soldiers speak Latin?
I forgot your name.
I got an award once. From the Mayor.
You want to ask me a question?
Something happened, didn't it?
You really look better.
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
You were great in the play, Cole.
Don't get mad.
Cole, you're scaring me.
What are you thinking, Momma?
Cole, please stop.
Yes, Cole?
I don't know how else to look--
S-ssssstop it!
See?
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip".
...Hi.
Hey, isn't that the preacher?
Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun down your brother. You're out. My turn.
Should we be doing this, dude?
"And a slash-slash there --"
Pardon?
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
People say he was a murderer.
It's time to make amends.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
Hey -- Macdonald's farm!
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
Chicken sandwich?
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Getting ready.
What are --
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
Suzie... No.
Like what?
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
And that makes you look like a squid?
That's not funny.
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
How about Brenda?
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Who's the lucky fella?
What?
All the rib eyes?
What are you doing?
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
Praise Jesus.
A what?
They're both a challenge.
You have a great profile.
Guess what?
Can I ask you something?
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
What the hell are you doing?!?
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
-- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
My very words.
They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Bandit?
Let's get the hell outta here.
I hate to say I told you so.
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
Never mind. It's nothing.
I'm all ears, good buddy.
Just fine. What's the weather like?
I'm here.
What's that, pardner?
Yeah, but...
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Breaker. Breaker.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
I think you're just yellow.
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
That's the point, Dickey.
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
Uh -- well, yes, uh just in terms of the men up there now, my team, he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so --
Anything on the Swede?
And a very bad gamble.
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
So he has no idea what's about to happen?
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
Maroon uniforms?
Your attitude sucks.
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to --
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
My debrief --
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been.
Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
What's the time frame?
I want to hear your version.
They shouldn't let people like you into space.
How long can you go without sleep?
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
Probably.
To who?
We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
What do you want?
What plan?
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
You want to fuck her?
What does Snow think you should do?
What's wrong.
Was she right?
No.  I love you.
Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
How can you be here...
A recoil, with no compensating mechanism.
You didn't like him?
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
You were reading my Renoir.
So it was "love".
You could do better.
What do you want?
Open the door, will you?
You put me life in danger.
Where?
Pretty bad.
Long enough.
So.
I like your coat.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Mike?
What are you talking about?
I can still use a gun.
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
Did you hear what I said?
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
What was that?
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug!  I got a 'choice' at all.
You in this with me?
You're here 'til what time?
How about dinner tonight?
Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
Nonot really.
Cause if you get in a bind--
I was there.
Flash, get lost.
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
Would you cool it already?
Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
But you like that in a man?
Some prep school thing.
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
Do you mind if I come too?
They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
Toxic dumps, huh.
I am old enough to--
The record--
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power, I could--
Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
Imagine how I feel.
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
Jawohl.
We made a deal with Barrack One.
Come on!
Who is it?
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
And maybe a little something else?
What are you looking at him for?  Any objections, Sefton?
Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
What are the chances busting out of here?
You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
Wisecrackers? Where did he pick up his English? In a pretzel factory?
You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
Let me go! Let me go!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!
You did?
Let me alone.
You're crying, Animal.
Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.
What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.
We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
Who did?
When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.
Toh-pak-cha=8A 
Where is he now?
He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
Is she still angry?
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
Data, this isn't the time.
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
Can you locate them?
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
Yes, where would you go?
So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
Better?
I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.
I thought you might.
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Sir?
Captain, are you all right?
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
Response?
What did you see, Chekov?
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
Why?
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
... How long?
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
Mr. Scott?
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
This Vulcan -- is he alive?
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
My God...
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew...
I -- saw no future --
He would not have spoken of it openly.
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
Good for you, Lieutenant.
All true.
But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
Until now.
... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
David --
David. Please.
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
Let them eat static.
No!
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
Try the emergency channels...
I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system.
Mr. Scott on discrete.
<u>WHY</u>?
The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.
I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
Carol Marcus --
You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan...
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
Very well.
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
... No, sir. It has not.
How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
Khan!
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
Cease fire. Look sharp.
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
All moorings are clear, Captain.
Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
Fine. Just fine.
Yeah.
You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
An experimental device, doctor.
Specifically, Humpback Whales.
Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
What's causing that!?
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
... It gives me a great sense of history.
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
Shields, Mr. Chekov.
Shields, aye.
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
Iowa.
They're gonna hafta take their chances.
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
... You're very perceptive.
How will that be done, exactly?
What do you mean now?
What's that?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
I bet you're a damn good poker player.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
Kirk. They're gone.
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
You tricked me.
... What does that mean?
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
Earth... But when?... Spock?
Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
Can we make breakaway speed!?
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
Three-one-zero, aye!
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?
Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off...
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
Hello? Computer...?
You have warp capability?
I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...
There are days.
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...
What's the rush?
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
Chase me!
I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
Do you know how they were damaged?
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
Come out, come out wherever you are...
Sir?
Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
Montana.  Energize.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
I do not know what you are referring to.
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
Where?
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
Are we on schedule? The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.
It'll be tight, but we should make it.
ATR setting...
Active.
Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
Cochrane?
No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
Friends from Cornell...
Why?
Port battery, ready sir!
Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?
Captain?
What are they doing?
You may need assistance, doctor...
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
Are you carrying a surgeon?
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
They'll respect him now...
Would you care to go topside?
You feign ignorance?
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, Captain James Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you, Captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.
Spoken by you?
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
Thank you, Captain.
Your research laboratory is most impressive...
Isn't it about time you became something else?
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
Kronos, sir?
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
I always wanted to try that.
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
WE volunteered?
I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
I am uncertain.
The peace conference.
Why would they give them to us?
You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute a joke?
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
WE SURRENDER.
Uhura?
A lie?
Trouble?
Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
- could take weeks, sir.
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
Indefinitely.
I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I dont show up for my physical on time!
Remember him?
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochrans own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
You can' t imagine them, Jean Luc. They're kids! All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant.
So... To happy endings.
Can you open the shuttlebay doors?
We are being hailed.
He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
What is our approximate distance?
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
Do you have life support?

What programs were accessed?
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
Understood.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
That will never happen.
Wont do what, Mister Worf?
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
But she's not the Enterprise.
Anything.
And the Senate supports you?
Yes.
What happened?
It's not quite the face you remember.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
Why are you here?
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.
They're holding position.
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
Praetor.
I don't see anything.
I don't think so... 
Gate three. It's boarding now.
How much are your rooms?
What do you do?
No!!! No!!!
I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
The extraterrestrial now looks like this.
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
Is that what's affecting your performance?
Hello George.
Shermin...
You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
Please...
Ah... no...
Steering wheel.
Gear shift.
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
Are you from up there? Space?
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
I do not understand.
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...
Is that a baby?
No... The closest...
Why?
Say it.
You want this ticket?
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
On the radio they say it's good.
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
What are you saying?
Horses.
Oh, you're pretty...
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
But...
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
I understand.
I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
What do I do now?
I will.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Doesn't make sense.
Bullshit!
It was a man though... right?
I don't understand.
Judy, that's stupid.
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
No problem.
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
I made my choice, Lenny.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
Jesus.
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
You talked to Iris?  When?
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
He has his uses too.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
I understand.  No, I'm not.
Sounds good.
Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
Faith OK?
Whattya mean?
Jesus.
2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
So lay it off to somebody else.
Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
I thought we were friends.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
Is this great fabric or what?
But that doesn't add, does it.
How's Zander?
Shit!
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
He's totally cut off from the outer world.
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
I guess.
Got your ticket?
Take it to him.
Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy?
Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
Testa?
Anybody talk to the press?
You have the body?
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
What kind?
Speck. Harold Speck.
How do you feel, Agent
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
I don't believe this.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was "Imelda." Have to give him that, had a sense of humor.
There was talk of a file photo.
Watch out for Dick Low, he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle, not unlike you, an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene, beat him up, force a confession -- all unauthorized, all illegal.  The Agent died that night, killed by the suspect. Richard Low got him killed. Worst of all, we had to hush it up, let the suspect go. The suspect was George Sheldon, the second man Richard killed.
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
Miss me, Dave?
Don't you touch him.
You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
The Academy, then CIIAC.
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
What's that?
Jesus.
The tattoo?
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
Does one exist?
It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
What was your weakness, sir?
Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
Was it Zero?
Yes, sir.
Michael, this is Grandma. I want to know if you got the part on that television program. I told the whole family and they're very excited to know if...  Skipping message. End of final message.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
Why? You're not a real man?
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
Tell me about it...
You too?
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
How?
Anything.
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
They're out of Glenlivet.
Let me just check on my boy.
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
The poor thing. Six years?
Do you have anything smaller?
No...
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Hello?
How are you doing?
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
Hi.
I heard you might be moving back...
So what's the difference?
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
There's the rub.
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today?
I didn't mention her once today.
Thanks, man.
You haven't been drinking, have you?
You want to talk about it?
What's the point?
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
Hello?
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
You gotta do it.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
That's bullshit.
That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit.
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
No!
What?
Sorry about interrupting...
She was hot.
Michelle went for you, right.
That was different.
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
...against the computer.
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
What a surprise...
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
Bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help.  I don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee...even though our wives are friends.
What do you want of me?  I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
What percentages for my family?
You take care of your family?
Is it necessary?
I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
And with prison record.
For killing a man.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
It's the real Thunderbolt, then.
Ever seen anything like that before?
That's for you to find out.
Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
Will you give this to him.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
I know now.  I'll make them call me Don.
They're waiting to see my father.
Michael, what are you doing?
Michael?
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
Don't you want dinner first?
I'm busy.
You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?
I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we can straighten everything out.  All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened.
What is it?
Do you renounce Satan.
I do renounce him.
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
Uncanny!
Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
I met him in New York.
Good afternoon!
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
Without the glasses you're not even ugly.  I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
I didn't mean with you in it.
Shoes too?
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
Esatto. I'm always planning.
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
Why?
What?
Oh God, I don't think so.
Marge and I are getting married.
I love Marge.
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
Do you think you can steer this thing?
Sure.
Who is it?
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
Such as?
What does that mean?
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
That's a terrific idea.
Tom?
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
Marge? Where are you going?
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall.
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
Will we see you later?
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
What do you want to change about this moment?
Why lie?
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
Peter, I... I...
Absolutely.
You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?
Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next.
I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
I can believe that.
What kind of people?
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
You must be rich.
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
So you haven't heard this record yet?
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
With the other hand, right?
Betsy, come over here a moment.
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
You said that?
Stick up?
Where.
A girl needs protection.
I don't like my real name.
You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you.
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
Do you understand why I came here?
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
O.K., cowboy.
Wiz?
You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?
Thank you.
Motor oil?
I'll go.
Partners?
St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg. = Hollow.
Dad?
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
I think  it's worse  now.
... including me.  Right?  
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down.
Me too.
No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
Nothing.  
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
When did you start smoking?
How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
I see...
Yes.
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
I'm not refuting anything.
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
Wait'll you see the inside!
We've been closed for a while.
Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
I'm here.
Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
Zackly.
Then I'll call you a cab.
It's possible.  I just don't remember.
What is it?
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
You should watch what you say.
Exactly.
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
Well, that's a relief.  I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets.
I'm not sorry for what I said.
Cigarette?
Not any more.
Her name was right there in front of them.  They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.
That's my r-r-rent.
I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident.
Oh...
What happened?
Miss Hayworth?
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
I think so.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
I know.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
Morning.
I wonder if you could help me.
Yep.
That's where the Brenners live.
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
It's a surprise, you see.
D'you want me to order one for you?
Yes.
I need her exact name, you see.
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Lovebirds, I see.
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
Mother, where did you go to law school?
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
We won't be here.
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
What?
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
And if you don't?
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...
He was killed last night. By birds.
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
Well... yes, sir, there are.
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
Aren't these lovebirds?
When?
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
So you're a lawyer.
So you came up to see Annie, huh?
Right next to the one you already had.
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
Seven o'clock then.
What?
Will I be seeing you again?
Without any clothes on?
No.
I'd still like to see you.
I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
Helping travelers.
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
Melanie, Melanie...
Where are they heading?
You said three o'clock.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
Yes.
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
For what purpose?
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
Birds?
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
Then let's go. Now!
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming?
You have his promise, then?
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
He's not home.
But Richardson?
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
Well --
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
They'll be thinking of that, too.
Not yet.
Hear him?
Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh.
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
No.
It might be an interesting case.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
This is a gift.
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
I presume you shall.  This won't be my last visit here.
You say you've come here on your own account?  No one knows you are here?
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
Yes, Doctor.
A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
You're not going to Gray.
It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
We won't.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
You killed her. I saw it.
Where the fuck did you come from?
What did they give you?
What Scar? What fucking scar?
The scar.
I heard you were looking for this.
How do you know?
You killed that cop Dutton.
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
This is where it happened. Right over here.
Are you ok?
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
... it connects you to me...
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
I want you... to bend over.
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
Erin!
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
You wrote this?
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Hi Mom!
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Tell me what?
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
What does that mean?
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
Thank you... Have you any news?
Your impatience is quite understandable.
You still haven't answered my question.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
I will be in just a minute.
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
May I see you for a minute?
Just twelve.
Where is the meeting going to be?
There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
No -- I'm afraid not.
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
He's my brother.
Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?
Should I run him through?
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
What is this, David?
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
What happens in tow and a half hours?
I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.
Ouch, my hair...
Smells good.  When do we eat?
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
Did we have a date tonight?
Who, Laddie?
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.
No, I'm not...
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
Max... what are you talking about?
Me, too.
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
Nowhere.
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
Wanna go to the comic book store?
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
Too damn dangerous.
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
Let's open it.
Let's open it.  Now...
I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
What we going to do?!
What?
What are you doing?
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
Load of bullshit.
I guess you're okay.
How far's that?
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
Why?
... Hey, somebody!  Open up, it's me, MacReady...  ... Come on, damn it... The towline snapped.  Been crawling around like a seal out here...
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
Maybe it ain't coming.
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
I think we should go on by ourselves.
What are you?
Morlocks --
What?
It's what they want you to see.
What do you mean?
I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
No, we created the Morlocks.
As slaves.
You took her because she helped me.
Now will you go?
Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
What?
Well there's something new.
Admiration?  My my.
You know I can't.
Alex, what is it?
Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
In the future, we'll be better.
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
David... I appreciate your concern, I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.
I would.
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
Yes.
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
Good night, then.
Thank you.
What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
Is it?
Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
This is out life, Alexander.  It's a hard life but it is how we have always lived.
Kalen...
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
In where?
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
And what's that?
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
Did you know my father?
My father used to talk about you.
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
No, it hasn't.
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
I gave you my dog tags.
What?
Why?
How long do we have?
Then why isn't there anyone around?
Where are we going?
You gotta stop thinking like that.
Good. How's your mom?
How?
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
I did?
He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
Don't you go to jail for that?
I know you need one when it's really cold.
So what am I supposed to do?
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
Sure.
Well, how'd you get here?
What's this?
This is pretty good. Considering...
So you never knew your mother?
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
Hon?
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
In the leg.
Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone.
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
That's certainly possible.
I have no problem with that.
Tell us about him.
It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.
Louise, is that you?
You're a bank robber?
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
Who is it?
Is this your car?
Yes.
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
Whose place is this again?
Thelma!
Maybe.
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Get the car.
Louise.  Where are we going?
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means?
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
Did you finish thinking?
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
She thinks he's a pig.
What happened to your hair?
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
Holy shit.
What for?
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
Why not?!
Whaddo we do?
Nothing.  It's not funny.
Harlan.
I am really sorry about this.
What?
Sorry!
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.
What'd I say again?
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
How far are we from Mexico?
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
What in the hell is it?!
What?  What are you talkin' about?
I'm not apologizing for shit!
Hi there!  You alright?
Yeah... sure did.
Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
Bob, do you remember Mary?
Thanks.
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
A surprise?
Yeah.
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.
I think your life's about to change.
Huh?
What are you doing?
Miami?
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Do what?
You're a sick man, you know that?
You bet.
What do you mean?
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
Thanks for picking me up.
I can live with those reflections.
What's that supposed to mean?
Meaning?
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
What's he like?
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
Why?
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
An old flame?
Magda!
What's up, Doc?
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
Ted, are you okay?
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
Oh God.
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
What happened to speak when spoken to?
Where've you been? We've been trying to find you all morning.
And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
John. How much time?
Still heading for Cuba.
Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?
Busy. But you've got his heart.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support.
We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
What's that?
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was.  The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight.
Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
Rug samples.
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
What the hell you doing?!
I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.
Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"?
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
This is a restricted area.
What'd she say?
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. An incontrovertible motive. And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house.
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
She's that subtle?
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
You've got no jurisdiction.
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
Ray --
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
Well, it was just a dream, I --
What the hell do you want me to do?!
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear Moon...
That's it. The Stronghold. Get us in there, we got a chance.
He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
Thank you.
Yellow bird... is gonna sing.
With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe --
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
No way. No fuckin' way.
I'll bet!
I could be, too.
Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
How did you know this was my car?
Why not?
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
It's what?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
Harmless!
You're an animal.
It's just as I thought.
You want to go ballistic?
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
What kind of games?
Looks like a tie.
I was, later.
I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR.  Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
You're crazy. We're level.
We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.
DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
Ohhh Mother!
Now have you got it?  Have you still got it?
Yawing right.
You go. I'm staying with it.
Well what?
Let me do the talking.
Why do you all have such funny names?
On what?
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
Tom Kazansky.
How was it?
Great move. Great
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
What what are you doing? We're cover!
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
What'd you do?
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
Who is the best.
He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.
Helping him in.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.
Hmm.  It seems you left something in our safe.
You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato.  The fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet.
Do you expect me to believe you?
If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
He had help.  From our side, sir.
Eight years.
I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.
How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
Suppose I do...then what?
Not since you lost him.
Shit!
Hey Harry...Harry!  You ever heard of Rekall?
Rekall?
You went to Rekall, remember?
I did?
Let me buy you a drink.
Come on, let's go have that drink.
I've got a weak signal over there.
I'm sorry.  Would you please rephrase the question.
Is that better?
Nobody?!  What's her name?
I don't know.
And you believe him?
Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  Okay?
Harry from work...He was the boss.
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...
As real as any memory in your head.
Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
Forget I said wife.
Where are you going?!
I gave you?
Ready as we'll ever be.
Cannon fuse.
Knock it off, Burt!
What the hell you doing back already?
Burt, can you hear me now?
Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
Oh my God.
He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
So what if we just did it...today. Pack up.  Drive straight down to Bixby.  Get serious.
Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
What the hell are they?
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
I'm gonna kick his ass!
Like hell you are.
Yeah...but no ties.
How's she doing?
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
Down, honey, down.
Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
Around here?  Why would they?
Darn it!
Forensic ballistics isn't an exact science, is it?
Gimme back my bottle.
You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.
-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right?
Oh really?
It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --
I specialize, Roger...
...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?
Do you have to do that?
They're just frightened, fucked-up losers that prison fucked up worse.
So what're we gonna do?
That's why I hate experts.
What's Art Esparza?
"The killer wasn't Chinese"... Cecil Stipe was right. .!
They're Chinamen who speak English. We call them informants.
Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
I embellished.
Got any booze in the house?
Eddie this is silly... are we supposed to pretend nothing's happened in the last ten years and --
I don't need sleep!
Racist asshole came at me.
No. You tell me, Shu.
How can I tell you what I don't know!
...I'm dying out there.
It was self-defense.
I'd l-like to answer the question.
Of course you know Dean Rabin, one of my Assistant D.A.s. Dean generally handles nuisance cases like the... what's the man's name?
Now maybe you got this case reopened because you see yourself as a thorn in society's side, or you want to walk into any restaurant in Chinatown and get free dumplings...
That's right.
But now you've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins. A subject on which you're dangerously ignorant.
Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
Your Honor, that's trial by ambush!
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
Yes, Mr. Dowd.
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
Tell me some other things about her.
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
OK, Gordon.
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
Smell something fishy, huh?
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
Teresa Banks.
He's dead -- good and dead.
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
We're heading into a difficult situation.
What do you mean?
Accidental?
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
It's late, Sam.
I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.
When?
Are you going to see James tonight?
Laura?
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
WE got it back, that's all.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
Why do you do it, Laura?
No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.
Bob.
But Bob isn't real.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
Did you make me a tape?
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
No.
Trees?
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
I understand.
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
Where's Dad?
We're late to get to your mother.
Oh, I thought I saw you.
Laura. What's wrong this morning?
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
I always thought you knew it was me.
Leland, what are you doing?
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Bobby didn't give you this?
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
Who am I?
What did he find?
Four cases in three years...
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
No.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
I'm just an M.D.
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
No further questions.
Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
Whatever the 'truth' is, let's hear that. You were her doctor.
'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Yes.
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
You live in the neighborhood?
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Yes...
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
I had a witness disappear on me.
I object, your Honor...
And are they going to get it?
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
What happened...?
Do you think it's my fault?
Well, then what are you doing here?
Is there going to be a later...?
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
How come you're calling me from...?
Pardon?
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
You know what happened.
Then why don't you testify?
...fifty thousand dollars?
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
He's not in, Sir.
No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...
Yeah.
What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
What do you want?
Are you out of your mind...?
...Gruber's not bad.
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Oh shit, what's today?
Today is Tuesday. What?
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
Looks almost cold now, don't it?
Hey, how about that!
Hey, there - open up!
Hurry up!  Jump in!
You look kinda lost yourself.
Did you see it come down?
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
So is the town, I notice!
Colonel - shooting's no good!
We will, sir!
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
Must be somebody in there.
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
Yes, but...
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
Might as well be, Dylan.  State of the art animatronics enhanced with bio- organic grafting.  Bull tendons, nerve bundles from a Doberman, even half the brain of a homicidal primate was...
You get any sleep last night?
Guess so.
Chase, you'd better come home.
Like Freddy.
Yes.
I'll be there in three hours.
Any history of epilepsy in your family?
No.
Does he have to stay here over night?
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
DO you mind...
In my bed.
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
Seemed, not was.
I've never mentioned it to him.
Freddy, for all I know.
Holy...
Yes?
No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
He would have loved this.
What?
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
He has a lot of hurt inside him.
Rick March.  Who the hell are you?
They were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards.
Believe what?
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
I feel like I got you into this.
Ya know... "It".
My parents don't do it anymore.
Who?
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
They have every right Chuck.
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
I don't know.
Twice.
Spying?!
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
You do?
What's that?
Immortality.
That's enough.
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
That's not a satisfactory answer.
What?
We've got a problem.
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
How long you been standing there?
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
Yes, that's true.
Yes.
And you didn't do anything about it?
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
Artie? That you, Artie?
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
Why? He's right in the groove.
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
Ready for another?
I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.
How much money you have between the two a'ya right now?...
Hey... I never said you was a pussy... Always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind'a thing... Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.
Why should it?
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
No big buildings like in New Orleans.
So, it's back to the islands.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
If your neighbors didn't mind, how'd you get put out of business?
Sailor... Lula loves you.
...Asshole.
General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez. Telefono 666.
Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?
I forgot to show you this. The gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. Said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life.
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
What brand'd she smoke?
Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a '54 Ford Pick-Up and a '64 Chevy Station Wagon. No survivors. Balls of flame and grinding metal.
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma.
What'd you say to her?
Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, 'I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you.'
That don't smell like a More.
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
You got me, peanut.
You certain?
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
What's that?
You think she's gonna make it?
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
It's okay by me, peanut.
Love you, too.
You been drinkin', huh?
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.
The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles.
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Got any plans?
Oh God! What does that mean?
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
Simple? Kill him? How?
Yes.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
I got your message... But you went right to Johnnie, didn't you?... I can't trust you, bitch - not for one minute... Naughty girl... Sailor and Lula are headed west, and guess what? There's no turning back. I'm in a killing mood.
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
You really are one dumb asshole.
You snore.
Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I --
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
So modest.
Shut up, James.
So -- what do we do now?
Such as.
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
You must be mistaken.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
How long have you been having them?
No. There's no one here.
Vernon.
Hello?
...reconcile with Emily.
Yea?
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
A little.
The one she wore on her wedding day?
I had to. Didn't I?
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out.
Want me to get that?
That's a big book you're writing.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
Hm.
How did I get here last night?
I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave.
It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.
But James. I mean... How long?
Maybe...
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
When we fall, we fall hard.
Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers.
I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
It's warm.
I didn't mean it that way.
Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
Near Carvel?
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
Yes, James.
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
I thank you.
So what are you going to do?
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
I'm kidding. Hello?
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
I know.
The more the merrier.
That's a nice greenhouse.
Who's he barking at now?
Tony. Now that I'm home.
Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that.
That's weird.
No, the dog.
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
Don't need to think fast to handle beer.
Beautiful. How's business?
Something wrong with that?
One hundred and twenty feet.
I'm working on it.
How old is Anna?
Notice the grain. See how deep and rich the red runs?
It was a beautiful present.
The birthday party.
Aren't you glad?
Anna will be away at camp. The house will be quiet. It's better when it's quiet.
C'mon, Walter.
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare.
How does it sound?
You live around here?
I think you do.
Cherry?
And when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? Is that when you jerk off?
What's with the boxes?
I'd say you're moving.
You sure you don't know nothing about this?
Apartment's okay.
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
Do you have many friends?
How come?
Banished... yeah.
I can't.
I know because... it's just something I know.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
What?
Of course.
I'm still thinking about it.
Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.
You couldn't say.
How do you define it?
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
Fuck you, Rosen!
I don't know.
What did you want to happen?
Sorry.
That's not a helpful answer.
I'm relaxed.
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
I don't see --
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
I don't like nobody behind my back!
This is garbage!
It was a small house.
What picture?
I'm talking about you.
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
What's the problem?
How young?
Why don't you just go now, okay?
My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.
Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...
I was always the one seduced.
Most people say the odds are against me.
All three -- in chronological order.
You must hate your brothers.
No you don't.
I say we call it quits.
I'm not scared.
What's your fucking problem?
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore--
I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
I think you were worried about me.
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
Hippy, just relax.  You're making the women nervous.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
You owe me one, Virgil.
We've only got one suit.
What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
Oh God, Lins... I--
Hello, Brigman.
'Fish'?
I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
Quiet!  Quiet!
SHIT!
12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
Uh, oh...
Stand by on the ROV.
He's losing it.  Talk to him.  Keep him with us.
When do you have to go back?
Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.
This one is gorgeous.
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
I presume by this method that you'll be able to uncover some new clue, either a handkerchief or an article of clothing... In other words, something which your men have not been able to find as yet.
It's already two hours... What are we going to do?
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
Well, what?
I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
Oh, Sandro...
I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
Are you joking?
Does it please you to say such things?
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
And why did you drop them?
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
Then I'll see you later.
Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.
Why?
I'm too sleepy.
You say that just to flatter me.
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.
At one time the Aeolian isles were all volcanoes.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
No, not like this one.
Anything new develop?
What boat?
Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...
And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
I would like to ask you something.
Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
He talked to you Himself?
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
He loves you the way you are.
Who told you this?
Agnes...
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
No.
What do you mean?
I don't know... I don't know...
Who?
Everyone.
Would you like to talk about it?
And what happened?
I got sicker.
I fell asleep.
Where'd it come from before that?
From God.
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
What do you mean?
Anything?
What's your real name?
No questions.
Sister Paul was in her eighties?  Did she climb up here often?
Like what?
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
You'll laugh.
Did your mother see angels often?
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
You can tell me.
She can.
Why?
How does she know that?
You're a mistake.
And why am I here?
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
Did you know what was going to come out?
Why were you afraid?
Yes.
And then what happened?
A wastepaper basket.
Are you ill?
Why isn't anyone coming?
Yes.
And the passage to the barn?
Who?
She'd seen him too.
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Agnes who did you see?
What did you do?
Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law.
Why?
Larry...
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Who are you?
Yes.
Who was the father?
What man had access to her?
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
You hate us don't you?
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
It's my affair too.
I'm only interested...
What?
How?
What is it?
The sheets...
Like keeping her home from school?
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
Don't deny it!
You just said...
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Hand rolled.
Saint Peter?
Do you want to become one?
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
Who is he?
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
Why would I lie?
Yes.
And the baby.
The usual ten per cent?
They are?
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Oh, it's all right.
All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
Ever seen one of these before?
Look, I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid there's been some sort of a misunderstanding.
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
Have I said something amiss?
You see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.
Gerron.
Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
Sure. .
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
Yes.
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
Parading's better!
Oh ... I dunno.
Yeah ... that's right.
Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
Have they?
Hello, Grandfather!
That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
Anything to spare?
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
We were going to do it.
Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
Tonight? We can't make it ...
Now, look here, Norm ...
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
Well ...
Look after him.
Yeah, you want to watch it.
Paul's grandfather.
How's that?
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
Cattle ranch!
... I don't know...
Yeah.  Two hours.
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
What's up?
You want to try?
I have recorded the transmission.
What?  <u>Why</u>?
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Where does that go?
What the hell's going on?
Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here.
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean.
It's clear.
It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
God, that smoke's poisonous!
Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.
Oh my God.
Good!  That's good!
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
This is horrible.
Blow the ship up?
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
Air lock?
What'd he say?
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
No.  It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites.  If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
Let's hear it.
Okay, Chaz, I hear you.  I've got you on my board.
Still worried?
Hey, can you guys hear me?
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
We made it!  Damn, we made it!
Where are you?
Now what?
Now what?
Two down, four to go.
All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
What did it do to you?
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
Let's get back and call this in.
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
Picking up velocity.
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
Not yet.
Whoa, wait a minute...
But I'm going first...
What's wrong?
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
What's the problem?
Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?
Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.
Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
Yeah.  Somebody won.
What?
What can I do?
Jesus.
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
Please do.
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
Yes. I do.
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
Just like that, eh?
You have no right to say such things!
... and Karen.
Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap!
You're too short for that gesture. Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.
She never proved anything, not a thing!
I had to get in, to meet Margo! I had to say something, be somebody, make her like me!
I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
I don't suppose there's a drink left...
You can have one at Max's.
No, it's not.  It's for this.
Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.
Claudia dear, come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good.
I was there. An eyewitness.
You mustn't worry about your little charge. She is in safe hands.
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
How... how was Miss Caswell?
Eve was incredibly modest. She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them.
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Forty-five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do I find you? Not ready yet, looking like a junk yard-
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
I told her. I sounded off.
When - when are you coming back?
I get a party, don't I?
What?
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
I don't think that's funny!
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
I will not calm down!
Don't calm down.
You've been all through that with Lloyd-
Don't be condescending.
Margo, let's make peace.
I wish it were.
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
Never try to outguess Margo.
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
Also Addison deWitt.
Thanks for your help... good luck.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
When I told you what every young actress should know.
Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
Well?
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
What for?
Probably not.
I've heard of them.
Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
Not at all.
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
Hello, Miss Channing.
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
Now who's show up at this hour? It's time people went home - hold that coat up...  ... whose is it?
I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.
I'm not crying.
- an understudy's performance.
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
What - again?
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
If you'd like.
Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
Not to you. Not to Bill.
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
Well...
It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
Lloyd, what happened...?
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
Margo, again...
It's just possible she didn't...
Lloyd, be careful...
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties...
Lloyd Richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "Cora."
Now just a minute!
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
I didn't think you would! It seems to me, Karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general-
Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
She's your understudy.
What do you mean?
You've been talking to that venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt-
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
How fortunate that I have an understudy so ready, so willing and so able to go on.
Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
That depends.
I placed...?
But that was the fourth straight time.
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
When's the audition?
I promise.
This is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run-of-the-play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib!
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention.  The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
July of '71.
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
You're not a kid anymore.
Anything you've got.
--you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
You want me to be the bastard.
--there had to be a White House overseer--
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
Who?
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
Sorry.  Now if it was Hunt you were interested in--
I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
I know where Dwight works.
Sure--off the record.
Can't help you.
--and we got a guy in Justice--
--there's nothing new in it--
Absolutely--
Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.
I think.
I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?
It's awfully hot--  --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--
Gordon Liddy, you mean?
Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
Just tell me about the goddamn article.
Who by?
--this'll only take one second--
I don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story.  I don't think we should cover the story, period.
You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.
So?
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
Ratfucking.
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
What?
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
--I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post--
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
I did all right on McCord.
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
--has any of them got an ax?--
--listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--
--no--
--which Young?
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
Hi. I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and I hate to bother you at home--
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
What are we gonna hear?
Why is this?
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
Hi...
Stifler told me.
That's nice.
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
I think I've had one.
You mean...and orgasm?
Then what the hell are you talking about?
Don't you love my sexy body?!
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
Hey, where's Finch?
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
You're not...busy?
Dad.
It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
Okay, I get it.
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
You've got something going?
No...you...go...ahead.
Shame on you!
No, not again.
Stifler, you're such an asshole.
That's my trick!
No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
About the other day...I've been thinking.
Now?!
I want to hear you say it.
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
Contact, dude.
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
Andy! Holy shit!
What happened? Did you cut yourself?
I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium.  The planet earth. It's good to be back.
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Are you okay?
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
What the fuck!? You too!?
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
Pull over! Now!
In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Enculé d'Americain.
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
What about me?
Andy? Andy is that you?
Where is it! Please!
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
Andy!
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
I was showing Sonya something . . .
Hurry, Grandmama!
Where is your home, Anya?
Who did you hear it from?
We're just going to refresh your memory...
Come out! I can do alterations.
I shant!
Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
Poor Meetoo!
Just what do you think you're doing?!
Come on!
You said you wouldn't laugh!
Why does everyone have to act that way?
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
What?
You'd lose your security deposit?
I'm getting a chest cold..
It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
Hey, you on television?
Come on.
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
Well, you take a meeting with him, I'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
It's an important issue.
Who are you?
What do you mean, next?
It's okay.
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
M'm.
Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
Uh, you're driving a-
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
You want your tennis stuff?
You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life... that's including any place... the worst... Europe, United... any place... Asia.
Yeah, I know.
Well... thank you again.
Oh, you see an analyst?
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
Well, who's Sadie?
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Oh, thank you.
what I mean?
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
No, so help me.
No.  You're a wreck.
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
big subject with me, yeah.
I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
M'hm.
Yeah.
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
Were you always funny?
Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!
I'm home!
G-go on, I'm interested.
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
Will it change your wife?
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock in the morning. You, uh, you got me outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't get a taxi cab. You said it was an emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up the stairs. Hell - I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? Is that possible?
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Two?
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Okay, let me have this.
Oh, Jesus, really?
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
Oh, I had the radio on.
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
Check it out.
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
Yeah.
I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
Here you are. There's people out there.
Oh, you got a headache!
You catch Dylan?
Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience.
I mean that as a compliment.
What are you making such a big deal about?  They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.
Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
Oh.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
You wanna lie down?
All right-so we can afford it.
We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
She's got great tits.
The movie.
I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors.
Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you feel breezy.
I'm in mourning.
What what's about?
He's allergic.
Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
Don't you miss it?
So where is young Jonah?
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
Let's get the kids.
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her.
Stupid tart.
Cal, my wife Judy.
Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys. Hey!!
Let me heal you, baby.
Go.
I don't think so.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
Not millions.
Scout's honor.
What was it?  What the fuck was it?
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
Accept a compliment.
What?
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
Not properly watered.
Don't be so sure.
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
It's a novel.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
You changed your mind.
What?!  You aborted our child?!
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
You're not ready.
I guess.
That's under lock and key.
They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.
I know.
What's a sign for that?
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
Sally did all this herself?
No you're not.
Hm.
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.
Easy tiger.
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
Well, yes, actually.
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
I...
Not at all.
The Shostakovich.
Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
Yeah.
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
Panes is here!
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
No.  Not something new.
Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
We're going to have to go back out there.
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night.
Nevermind.
She's such a great photographer.
The both of you.
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
General -- we have to talk sometime!
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
Out here I'm just what?
So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
Bala!
Z!  Over here!
Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
So...you two are in love?
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
Did you see that?  How he gave <u>you</u> the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!
Oh, I never catch colds.
That makes me feel just terrible.
Yeah.
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
What time does the show go on?
Eight-thirty.
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
So I see.
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
Much better.
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
No -- I don't want anything.
I mean -- her apartment.
What's your friend's name?
Something wrong with your legs?
Your stomach?
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
You want me to move the television set in here?  You play gin rummy?
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
What for?
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
Are you all right?
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
The dishes?
We're going to finish that gin game.
Mind if I come in?
No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
Mr. Dobisch said that?
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
Where is your apartment?
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
I am?
Not that I have anything to hide.
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
Yeah --
Now what was your news, Baxter?
That's just one of the privileges that goes with this job. You also get a nice little expense account, the use of the executive washroom --  Say, what happened to you, Baxter?
Yes, sir.
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
No key!
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
What's gotten into you, Baxter?
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
Baxter?
What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
Kubelik -- with two k's.
It's regulations.
How's the patient?
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?
You got a girl-friend?
Still stuck on her, huh.
No kidding.
Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
-- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Please -- just let me sleep.
What for?
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
It's been hell.
Fran -- remember that last weekend we had?
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
What do you think?
I have that date -- remember?
Oh. Our friend from the Chinese restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better keep it here.
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
Atlantic City?
What are you talking about?
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
What's there to talk about -- this whole thing disgusts me.
What !
Get out --
How about a drink ?
How long were you up there ?
No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
Smoke !
Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?
They're not Cong.
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
Who knows? Right.
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
What do you want ?
I only met Kurtz once.
Would he remember you ?
Touchy.
It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.
What -- happened here.
This gentleman or myself ?
A lame ?
But why ?
Well, he's killing now.
The Vietnamese think it's theirs -- I guess the Americans do, too.
What's your name, sailor ?
You smell that.  You smell that?
Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees.
My orders are from Com-Sec Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter Kurtz commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
He musta changed !  I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
Hairy ?
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
You know, some day this war's gonna end..
We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
No -- no, sir.
You can't have water after morphine.
Gimme water.
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
Nah.
A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here.
Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
You think?
This boat's a mess.
You're Australian?
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
His name is...
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
What if I say no.
Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
Well who the hell verifies that ?
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
Well , who's in command here?
You came right to it, son of a bitch --
Where's your chief supply officer?
Beverly Hills --

Avalanche season is coming.
95   CONTINUED:
39   CONTINUED:
What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.
Thanks.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
-- Permanently?
What's going on?
You're hurt.
Ben Corbett?
Sounds like professional jealousy.
Next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me.
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
I'm here to do my job.
Told you I'm fine!
You don't feel cold?
Stay still.
Where's my ELT?
They think you're in Fairbanks. If not, they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow.
Emergency transmitter?  What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?
Shut up!
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?  That's good.  Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.
Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
Why the smirk?
Dead.  Trappers killed him.
It's Sam Wilder!
I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...
He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors.
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
Emergency room only.
I've got Jews at my table.
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
Sorry.
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
How do you know about my mother?
What needs clearing up?
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
Hello.
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
You know what? I...
About a dog.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
Sorry. What are those cards?
Frank loves you. You know that... but I've spoken to him and he feels that --  -- as a businessman, with limited resources...
Absolutely.
Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?
Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
Now we'll both call him.
That's very thoughtful.
Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
So you're practically finished, huh?
What?
No fucking way.
Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years -- shit, listen to me.  I sound like some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but I just got to ask you.  Everybody talks about how you left the Agency and got into the business and then how you went after the Russian, Nicholai Talinkov --
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
Five million dollars?
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
Game over, bitch!
What?
I don't know what the fuck you are.
Who is the mark?
I bet you fucking know!
You think this is a fucking joke?
What?
I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
Now what?
You want me to pump?
Electra.
No.
Had?
Women?  No... not really.
Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
Do you think he's here?
Sorry.
They saw you coming a mile away.  If I had known we'd be using --
Then, we wait.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
For Nicholai?
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
Yes.
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
I think I got one today.
They're worth less points.
Jesus, if someone had --
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
No?
Why?
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
Why?
Because, I'll take it.
Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
Attraction is a complication?
Yes.
Is this becoming complicated?
Martin.
He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
Why are you working today?
Do you think about their wives or their families?
How much farther?
Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.
Average.
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
What are you thinking about?
I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't that funny?  I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one.
Some.
You mean quit?
I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don't know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time.
How to make a buck!
It all comes down to ideology and they've lost theirs. If I'd been here ten years ago, maybe they wouldn't be in the mess they are today.
What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.
He's not drunk, he's crazy.
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
Like Custer huh?
Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
I thought that was part of the charm!
Thought of everything haven't you.
No, why?
Perfect, but I can't use it right now, I've got to get these locks done; it's a matter of priorities.
Can you do the lock on it?
We're going to need it all.
Am I late?
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
Red or white?
What happened to Katka?
Don't tell me you really are in love?
Chris! Tell me some good news.
WE gotta think of something.
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
Yeah, no problem.
You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
Good morning.
No!
They didn't look like medical files to me.
I've been around.
I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
I'm not staying out late and I can't come back to your place.
Doug you said you wouldn't be long. Come on, I've got to go. Now!
It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
I don't understand, it's your home?
Sure, I've done it easily.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Look, if you can get them to finish it by Friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.
Can we charge admission?
Great. And your all set for the performance?
What for?
Any chance of getting me out on bail?
Will they free me?
It's a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the States.
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
I had it coming from someone.
Uh-huh!
You will wish you hadn't.
Enjoying our hospitality?
How do I know this isn't a trap?
Would you like your things now?
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK.
No problem, is it at your place?
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
Josh!
You are responsible...What has happened?
I'm sorry about how we --
It could help with a new car --
Out with Belinda?
Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
He goes to my father's church. He could've died --
I don't want to have any conversation.
That's deep --
Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable.
Because I try to be nice to people?
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
The play's in a couple of weeks.
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
So you're talking to me?
What?
Yes. But not as a date date.
Before we do this.
What's wr--?
Come on.
A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.
Pull over.
Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here.  I could start by driving her to school --
What's Landon Carter up to?
Did you give him a gift?
I'm asking how much.
I care for her.
Landon. You're not the quiet type.
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
Praying.
Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
I'd do that --
Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
Landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself.  Some of us remember how your father --
What do you want, Biff?
This... is the number one single?
Huh?
Hi, Marty.
How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
Not a holocaust --
You know damn well that's not what I meant.
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
But Professor --
Then where the hell is he?
Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!
The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
Marty.
Pardon me?
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
Where did you get this?
That's just what I needed to hear.
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
Marty,  I know I've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future, but....well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder....are they....
But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
Yeah.
What do you feed him?
You ever had to open it up like that before?
You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.
What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
Can I be honest?
Nothing.
Well, I got homework.
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
I can look and see.
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
Look at all this junk.
I don't know.
Yeah.
I don't want a steak.
Don't.
No.
Everybody loves trout.
Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean?
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
New Jersey?
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
Not really.  This is pretty important.
Buckaroo--! Sorry--
All accounted for?  Where's Penny?
We're going down!  Onto the runway!
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
This is so embarrassing...
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
The girl I remind you of.
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
Not too terrific, sir.  I apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire.
John Whorfin will kill us!
What's happening with my call to SAC?
What's his problem?
Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.
It's a spittin' image.
Why me?
We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it.
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away-
What DID you mean?
Yeah, he's funny that way.
Could you come back later?  It's just...  too hot... My head is killing me.
I beg your pardon?
Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.
Ever act?
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
Wuddya got for me  what the hell happened to your face?
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started
Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going  don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
Can be. Not easy, but 
...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
What kind of scribbler are you  newspaperman did you say?
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life  why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and  and  and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
Howdy, neighbor.
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time 
Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
What do you think happened?
Jesus... They can tell that...
Jesus, Charlie, I...
...Don't look at me like that, neighbor.  It's just me  Charlie.
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help 
I'm sorry if I let you down.
F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
...Okay
Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605?
Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr.  Lipnik.
Home. Watching TV.
Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him?  I'd have to be really dumb to do that.
The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident.
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
It's been three months.
No.
How's not smoking?
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
What was she like?
You should do something about this lock.
I'm De...
How long were you dating him?
How long were you having sex with him?
About a year and a half.
Yes.
Are you arresting me?
Do you have a cigarette?
Did I miss something?
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
But you said you liked men to use their hands.
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
But you didn't hurt --
Even though you were fucking him.
You tell me.
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
Didn't you study it in school?
I didn't.
I like you.
Don't get too cocky.
I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me.  I'm going down to Johnny's club.
No.
Can I talk to you a minute?
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
What are you researching?
Really.  What are you writing about.
It won't sell.
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
You workin' on another book?
The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.
What was the weapon?
Nope, can't say that I do.
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins?
What's goin' down, son?
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
I don't know.  I'm just not.
Catherine says you don't like her.
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
Yes I did.
No Lisa Anderson, detective.
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
New York.
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
Who is it?
You name it, I paint there.
When?
Who did this?  Who did this?
Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour.
I need a dealer.
... Can you... decipher this for us?
I'm not black.
Not black.
Who said that?
I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here  I made this for you.
Good.
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
I thought you hated this place?
What who's saying?
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but  whatever. I'm really excited.  And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published.
I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
Me? Why?
How can I ever thank you?
What? Wait a minute... talk to me.
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it  did your girlfriend leave you?
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
OK! Goodbye!
I will relay the message.
Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious...
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
Where's the fire?
Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
Admiring your handiwork?
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
Didn't I say that?
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
Well, I could ... free up some time...
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Y'mean frame him?
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
No, just give you a splitting headache.
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
You certainly will not.
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
I'm on break from-
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
I was just hanging around.
No beauty...
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
What happened to his wife?
He needs extreme cold to survive. His cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.
You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
And she did it all for me.  For love.
She wants to kill you.
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
The dreams again, sir?
It'll never work.
...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
Too much wealth. Too fast. Half of Gotham zombied-out. A technology that self destructs. He's protecting more than industrial secrets, Alfred.
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
Recognition, of course.
Enigma.
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
Nostrovia.
La'chiem.
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
Would you? I'm not so sure.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along?
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
I don't want to remember!
Excuse me.
Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
Absolutely not.
Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
Please. I swear I won't say noth-
That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
How much do you weigh?
The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
No.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
All street mimes should be executed.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
I suggest a nice big bomb.
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
Boss! Jesus! They've --
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
I've seen worse.  Much worse.
How'd you know it was me?
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
Nice snap, huh?  Pulitzer Prize, 1963.
Yep.  He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop?  Jim Gordon
You are on drugs.
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right!!
Do we know anything about him?
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
It isn't working any more, David.
Hi,
Hi.....  Roses.
Right first time.
Oh yes.
It's very good Bernie.
Everything okay, David?
We'll be able to start this afternoon.  I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  Now, that'll impress the Governor.
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
David, David, David ...
I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
Welsh.
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
You arrange those flowers yourself?
what a pleasure, Governor.  Welcome.
Interesting suit.
I am sorry you feel that way.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.
And Boot-Head.
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
So, like, where is she?
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
Hey Butt-Head, look. A jack. Heh heh.
Uh, you first.
Dill-wad...
Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
Really? I poop too much.
Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
They look like a couple of kids chief.
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
Cavity search...?
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
D.C., Chief.
Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!
You scored with two chicks?!
Who sent ya?
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
Maybe this is heaven.
Oh, honey, we may need that.
We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
Where are your skulls and bones?
Of course I did.
Lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here.  You're going to be who you are... whether you're alive or dead ... and over here -- it's... It's flat... there's no food, no colors ... you can't smell the flowers.  If we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful...
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
We were trying to scare your mother.
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
Did you get the paint?
You don't have an appointment, do you?
Aren't you dead?
Hell is other people.  You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here.  You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?
We have to start simpler, is that it?
I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.
Are you Juno, our case worker?
We're very unhappy.
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
So, <u>never</u> let Beetle Juice out. Never.  Besides...  We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.
Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
God, you're anatomically correct!
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
He's your cousin.
Why not?
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
Stepmother's...
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
All right, you dead people!  Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
Is the rest of the house as bad as this?
Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!
It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone.
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?
No more, Robert... No more needles...
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
Would you care for a drink?
Did you lose something?
Yes. I lost my remote control.
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
... I'm...  ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey...  ... With us ...
I see.
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
Yes, it is very good!
I see, Ben.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
I understand.
Thank you, Ben.
Certainly, Ben.
We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
... Sir?
Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
... My suitcase.
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
No. I don't object.
Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
No.
Compensated...?
Those trees were very young when I first arrived.
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
Yes, I will.
Yes. It has.
Yes. I will.
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
No, sir.
Oh? What?
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
Who am I thinking of?
Tell your friends.
What?
Yeah. You want a beer?
Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.
What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.
What are you doing?
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
You've always loved the animals.
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
I need a shower.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
Schwartz.
Yex?
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
Moving story.
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
Yes, well...
What?
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
Just.
Tickets to Malkovich?
Sure. It'd be fun.
Let him try.
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
You can be John Malkovich.
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
Two hundred dollars, please.
The Great Mantini?
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Fine. Let's drop it.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Forget it.
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
Do we get to wear a crown?
No you mustn't, my child.
No! Don't harm the vessel!
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
Yes?
I love you, Lotte.
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
What's the play?
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Do you mind?
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
I've got to leave Malkovich.
But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.
Well what?
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop.
Not like He punished me.
No. Sorry.
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
I want somethin' sweet.
Yes?
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
Ya think?
In case of what?
They good whitefolks?
I want to work, Miss Lady.
Well, what can you do?
Should I wake her?
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
Can't locate him.
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
It's her, ain't it?
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
You?
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
Just me.
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
She was only-
Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie Treehorn wants to see you.
We've had some terrible news.  Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing.
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
Yeah, it sucks.
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!
What's this?
Where you going, Dude?
If what's during league play?
I'm shomer shabbas.
Kill that poor woman.
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
And this is the study.  You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.
Uh-huh.
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
Take it easy, Dude.
This is quite a pad you got here, man.  Completely unspoiled.
Is that what that's a picture of?
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
I was talking about my rug.
You mean coitus?
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
A hundred.
Oh that's okay, I hardly even--
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Increases?
Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.
Anyway.  How much they offer you?
Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
Yeah, and in the meantime what do I tell Lebowski?
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
They're nihilists.
And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
Uh-huh.
Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money!
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't wanna be a hard-on about this, and I know it wasn't your fault, but I just thought it was fair to tell you that Gene and I will be submitting this to the League and asking them to set aside the round.  Or maybe forfeit it to us--
Shut the fuck up.  Hello?
Well. . . yeah.
Oh, shit.
I'm not--
You happy, you crazy fuck?
<i>You'll</i> take him.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
Recognize him?
I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
Nomak?
Getting your attention, Paco.
From his father, of course.
We're locked in.
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Going on twenty years now.
She's been bitten.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Is something wrong, my friend?
Hold out your hands.
What are you doing?!
It's dark in here.
The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
You're a monster.
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening --
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
How?
--or incredibly fucking naive.
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
Don't know--just that she was afraid--
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
Why?
Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man!
Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."
--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
This is funny?? This is tens of thousands of fucking dollars!  You pricks! I'll see you in fucking court!!
Druid Hill Park.
No.
--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
Why is there no "our" here?
You feel no need to get married or anything.
Was that you laughing?
No.
I want to see something!
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
How'd you know they were--
So lemme see it.
--thank you, Heather Arendt--and arend't we glad you're here--a real witch--
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn <u>child</u>.
Yeah?
Get <u>out</u> of here!
Whatta you got, telescopic vision?
Boy Kurth.
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
--Cotter--
You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?
What're you doing?
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
Let's get inside.
There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
What is all this shit?
Why?
--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
What's that?
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
Elly Kedward?
What?
No. We <u>all</u> go.
"It's why the witch kills children."
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
...For you I answer the door. If you wanna stay here, that's fine. But I'm retired.
...Ray?
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
Remy.
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
Well now you do.
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
What "what"?
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
Yeah...
What's this?
Don't throw that out.
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
What day is it today, Angie?
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
Jeffrey?
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Jeffrey! Come on in.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Yes, but.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Yes? What is it?
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
Do you like that?
You don't?
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
. I. uh.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Are you a bad boy?
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death.
I'll call you.
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
Shh. I'll tell you.
They hurt his head.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
Okay Frank.
Terrible. boring.
Maybe so.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I don't know.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Yes. I do.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Well, how did it go?. What happened?
. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
Okay. okay.
What am I going to do?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
What was that all about?
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
What?
Do you want the car?
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
Nothing like this back home.
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
Should we buy it?
Surprise.
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes.
Why are you speaking?
No.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
Goodness.
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
No fucking way.
Oh hey, one more thing?
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
Good night.
I would if I could get some sleep.
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
How are we doing?
Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
Nothing.  Todo esta bien.
Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart is racing.  Have you been using drugs?
In how long?  A week?
Surprised to see me?
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
I just can't get over the size of that ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at it.  Tell me you don't love that ring.
Layaway shmayaway.
Un sapo?
Yeah, maybe.
You're saying life will take care of Diego?
I'm sorry, George.
I know.
She's angry.  It's all over the news.
Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
Tell Mom, you know...
And that FBI agent, Trout?  When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said...
Look what the cat dragged in.
Pablo said no?
Not in front of the kid.
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
Are we gonna split up?
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
Let me ask you something.  If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
There's schools in California.
Shhhh.
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
I wish there was shit like this back home.
Are we good?
Nice weed, huh?
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
And here?
How much are they paying you?
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
And how many are we?
Where's Kader?
It's good nobody is following us ...
No ...
It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over.
Why?
That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
Yeah.
What'd he die of?
That's what my report will read.
Increase his heart rate.
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Objection sustained.
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months.  I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
What about Miss Lawson?
Yes.
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
Doctor Trammel, when did you first diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart disease?
Just one last question.  What does the sign on your office door say?
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
Intense.
And how are you now?
It didn't.
Mr. Roston I know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did.
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
No -- she asked me about cocaine.
That's enough.
What did you prescribe for her?
Chinese peony root.
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
We dated for about a month last year.
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
What changed?
What about Miss Lawson?
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
I don't know.  I'm not sure.
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
Yes.
P.M.
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
Yes.
I thought the subject was sex?
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
This is your house.
Oh -- Well, they're different.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
You're a monster.
No -- he's lying.
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
I love you.
I can back it up.
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
Can't it wait?
What's she like?
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
What's wrong?
Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.
I'm not.
Why didn't you come to me?
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
I don't mind waiting.
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
I do not need instructions from you to bathe!  I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come!  Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
What's he saying now?
What?
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
Grateful!?
Well, I'd like to read them.
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
Carolyn!
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
You want me to call the doctor?
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
If I'm not taking you away from anything.
After the divorce.
Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
Francesca.
Sure you want to keep those in the house?
No, your kids.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure.
I feel so embarrassed.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.
But no one in particular.
No, I'm just saying --
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
Oh, sure. Great.
Oh.
I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have?
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
Are you hungry?
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
For who?
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
You feeling better Franny?
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
What happened?
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
Where's the gangsta of love?
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
Everybody just be cool.  Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal.
You know I can't.
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
I lied.
That place is already bad luck.
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
What are we doing down here?
Did you do it?
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
I didn't sell it.
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
No way man...
Shit, that was fast.
We just thought...
Yeah, you heard of him?
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
So Caesar, what did it total out at?
I think you're fucking crazy!
Sit down, Gino!
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.
Oh, shit ...
So, you just got out?
Not bad.  What for?
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
There's no time.
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
It's impossible!
But you know he did it.
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
You don't, you can't believe that ...
Shut up, Violet!
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
You need the money just like we do.
Shut up, Violet.
They were in a car accident.
Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry.
I should be going.
You can't kill me yet.
Why?
Okay, sure, Mick.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
Who?
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
'63 Chevy.
Caesar is your husband?
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
The redistribution of wealth.
What?
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.
Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
Yes.
How much money?
That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.
You think I'm lying?
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
Do you think you know me like that?
And where is it now?
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
Hey, Caesar!  You take care of this girl, or I find out!
No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones. Not now.
Unbelievable.  Can you believe that, Violet?
Caesar wants me to stay.
Oh, God.
Mickey?  What are you doing here?
Yes.
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
Paris.  I live in Paris...
I think so.
What do they want me to do?
You're a U.S. Citizen?
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Kane.  Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?
You are a friend of his?
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
We thought you were gone for good.
Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better.  I'm assuming you're still in the market.  It's the same vessel?
Yes.
Excuse me?
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
I need a ride.
You have blood on your pants.
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
What does that mean?
Okay, so you're a victim.
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
Where are we?
You got me pretty fucking curious.
What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
You knew he was coming.
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
You could do that?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
Shit, we didn't sign in.
So get the hell out of here.
What?
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
What?
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
It came from your hip.  Under the skin.  You have a bank in Zurich.  You remember Zurich?
...ervices.
...elephoned sir.
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
Sign the form so we can get to it.
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
What has Tuttle done?
Yes. I'm impressed.
Tell me about Layton.
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
Say it was a mistake.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
I want to report a wrongful arrest.
Don't look back! Act naturally!
Where are you taking me?
What?
Who will?
Let go! We've got to stop!
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!
Oh God! What have we done?
We? Don't blame me!
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
Where are you going?
Would you really, Sam?
He is dead.
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
I did it for you.
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
Yes.
Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
A woman eh? I see.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
Is Mr Helpmann here?
Mistake?
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
What is it?
The pace?
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be -
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
Es impossible.
No underwear?
He looks like a cop.
I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
Let's do it!  It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
He's going to be all right, right?
IB Bangin.
See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert.
What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
Oh man, Bucky.
At least he's got people around him.
No.
Yes?
You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
You asked me not to come.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
He'll be all right.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
Frank.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.
No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift.
I'll drink to that.
What do you think?
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
How can that be? He was getting better.
Would you like to come in?
Where you going?
The brakes are shot.
I've taken that into consideration.
C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
Oh no!--I just remembered.
You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe.
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
Wait.
You packing up tonight?
Yes.
Which would you prefer?
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
Why do you say that?
Eleven and a half.
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
I write for you sometimes.
Did you bring your grey suit?
Define your terms.
Do you feel good about it?
No.
I lost six pounds...
Aaron, will you tell me?
This is important to me.
What?
This isn't friendship.
How?
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.
Ready.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
We came from Washington.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
Just when do you start, telling people?
Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions.
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
I'll speak to you.
How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
It's not opinion.
So great -- right?
How's it going?
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
You have to celebrate with me, don't you?  Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'
Jane?
I didn't think you'd make it.
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
Well, what is it?
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
Hi.  It's me.
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
What?
Why?
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
It's just an innocent question.  Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.
Is the manager cooperating?
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
May I please have another little kiss?
I like you very much, Walter.
But you gotta love me!  Why do you think I made that statue of Alice?!
What?
I know.
People seem to like my cat.
Well...
Yeah, why?
Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!
I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
Hm.
Police officer.
I'm not looking to pinch you!  I don't care about you, or the girl.  But you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what I want to hear.  Now!
NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
I won't say good luck, Walter.
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
Well, I'll go home with you.
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
Oh, OK.
Suck!
Yes.
Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
I do?  I guess I do.
So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
How are you doing?
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Leave me alone.
Pretty shallow of you.
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
Where?
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
But you threw a knife at my head!
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
Buffy...
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
I want to die.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
Well, I guess you got what you came for.
Nicole...
Hi, guys.
Hi.
She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom.
You're kidding.
I never thought of that.
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
Ah, you'll be coming back.
I am.
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
How ya like that?
I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
Get over here.
No!  You're playing with my mind!
Neither will I.
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
He' s confused--
It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball.
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
What's it say?
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...
Ebby's told me a lot about you.
Good--then listen.  "I sing the body electric.  The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them--"
Did you call me a cocksucker?
Beg me again!
Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
Drive off your back leg.  You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-
Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.
I'm having a blast.  God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
How?
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.
I was great, eh?
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
What do I gotta do?
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
I'm going to the Show.
I'm trying to thank you.
Why am I a fuck?
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
Well, I got Annie all warmed up for ya...  She's just waiting for you to show up, y'know...
It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
I gotta go now, Dad.
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
You were wandering around.
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
Hey!
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
Oh. Have a good day at school.
Dad!
I'll take Columbia for twenty.
It was eight.  Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.
Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
All right, fine.
...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
Yeah?
Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
What people?
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
You never - ?
Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.
Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Sam, we got a problem.
Right away. Okay?
She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.
Hey, Mitch.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
Understand?  I'm sorry.
You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either.
What do you need?
You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.'  He didn't say that to you, did he?
You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in...
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
Okay?
With what?
He wanted a watch, too.
I bought him a watch too.
I want you out of here! I want you out of here!
Take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here!
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
I threw it away.
What'd you have?
Listen to me.
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
You understand? What? Let you go?
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
Oh, you are...
- you could put 'em on your expense account?
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
Loose machines are right back over there.
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
All right, I will, I will.
Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.
I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
No, Sir.
What?
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
When I left here with the money...
Mm.
I didn't give 'em the m-
I don't want to go to Europe.
You gotta go back out there.
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
You can't talk to me like...
Hey.
Hey!
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
Now move along.
Here we go!
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
For what?
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
Hi, Jennifer.
I can see that. Sure.
Listen, Ginger... you know, this is probably not... I don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with Ace.
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
Thank you.
Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
Okay.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
Sure did.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
Yes, you are.
Yes!
Get lost?
Get lost?
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
Ace saw Vegas one way.
...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here.
I took care of everybody.
Stacy. 
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Angelo and Buster.
Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
Take it easy!
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad.
Charlie M.
Hey.
You sure?
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.
What's the matter with you?
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
Hi.
Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
A whip?  Now that's going too far!  Some of these women have no shame!
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
She has a real spirit.
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
I've been looking for you.
Catwomen. Lots of them!
I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one!  What do you think you're doing?
Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
I don't know, Boss, you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you...
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
Hey, Captain God!
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine...
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
You're late.
A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
Where do you think you're going?
What are you doing on Theo's line?
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
What was that for?
Say something ...
I know where it is.  Give me that phone back.
I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
I improved on the fucking original.
He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
Do I know you?
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
They're holding my husband downstairs.
Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life.  This has gotta be some "put-on," right?
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
Stop throwing names at me.
"Theo?"
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
You can't give up.
Yes?  Yes?
Your husband?
Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
He had a gun.  I have it now.
The guy with the transplant.
Damned if I know.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
L.A.P.D.
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
They did some great job of reforming you.
You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.
Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
You're making it too easy.
It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
Just relax.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
Who am I talking to?
Call me "Nels."
Yeah?
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
Where's the backpack?
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
There's no lady here.
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
So let's call this the usual.
Yeah?
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
That's what he said. Jimmy.
An excellent quality.
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
She's not a tart.
What's that supposed to mean?
Doesn't the water get to your nails?
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
Would you like a drink?
He lived here with you?
Yes...
But you can t stay, you know that?
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
Maybe.
You mean that?
Why?
Dil --
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
I said stop it.
Make it up to me, then.
When?
He'd bring me carnations.
Do you like me even a little bit?
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
And you wouldn't leave me?
You like me better like this.
Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here?
Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.
You knew which man?
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
In a manner of speaking.
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
Why?
Yes.
Whatever you say, Dil.
Love you, Dil.
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
Dil!!!
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
Tell me what she wore.
You know her, Jimmy?
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
Need to go across the water.
He's all right.
Eddie and Tinker died.
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
And what if you don't?
You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at.
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
Aye, I do, Peter.
Thank you, handsome.
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.
No fucking way.
What's that?
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
Why can't we?
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
She your wife?
Don't I know it.
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
Now, that was worth waiting for.
Yeah?
Like what?
Having two pints in the Rock.
Don't think that way.
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
What?
The fastest.
What you say, faster?
I said you bastard -- stop --
What if I did?
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
What are you talking about?
-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
I could eat a horse.
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
You don't look so bad in this light.
Lord, you're stubborn.
Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.
Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
Can you remember anything at all?
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
I know, but this is all we've got left.
I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Because they're still here.
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
Me? Why me?
Yes -- ?
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
I left him hanging around the American Express.
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
You can't.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Okay.
You did.
Tuesday.
Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
Who?
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
Are you going to listen?
I don't believe it.
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
The money is unimportant.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move.
Mrs. Lampert --
About how wealthy would you say?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Is it all right?
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
Oh, la.
Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Félix lives?
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
Oh. I guess.
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
Instant divorce you mean?
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
Don't you understand French?
En garde.
On the street where you live.
Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
How would you like a spanking?
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
How do you know what they're doing?
Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
Yeah? What's that?
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
One more time.
You aren't planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy and Rod, are you?
The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
You said that two weeks ago.
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
Not much further.
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
You know her?
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
You know where I can find her?
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
No.
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
He says he loves me.
I don't know what I'm so scared of.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
Someone tried to kill me.
You ok?
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
Twenty eight years ago.
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
You heard about that?
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
Don't you think it's sick?
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
Are you coming to the party?
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
Did he say anything else about her?
No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
You ok?
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
That wasn't me ...
Okay, okay.


...yeah.  Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
Freezer in the back.
Uh, huh?
Except for the fact that I need cash.
I need your truck.
Go on.
Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
Come on, get in the truck.
Are you kiddin'?
What the hell's goin' on?
...-ed.
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
God-...
...-ed.
Get him to stand up, Night Shift.
And I'm a peaceful man, and...
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--
Back up!  Back...
Come on, old Pete.
I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
Come on, old...
Ho, ho...
Hang on!

 Listen!  Listen...

You're--?  What?!
Then stay...
Come on!

Uh-oh.
And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
Listen, Arlo...


Hey, hey, hey.
Arlo!  Arlo.
Reach into my pocket.
Yeah.

Stop.
And Brynner's right on...
Forty-nine point four.
What?

Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
Who drove the ice cream...
 Yeah.
I feel faint.
You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.
...within five minutes.
I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...


It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.

 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
Colonel Vitelli.  We got a busted-in cold vault inside.
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
Mm-hm.
...you were right, of course.  But after...
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
And let me guess.  You failed.

...happen if I drop this?
Pleasant surprise.
I can't say it's a surprise.
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...

 Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.
Well.  It appears someone's been lying to us.
Radio the bikes.
Sir, all potential customers have been informed of the delay.  Fur-...
I wanna patch in from...
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
Get 'em in the  middle of the dam.
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.
...general store.
Richard Long.
...screwup?
....-lene.
...dangerous.
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...
Where's Arlo?
Your fellow hero, untouched...


...like April.  It gives him gas. And make sure there's  two pots of coffee...
You got thirty minutes.
It's after five...
Go.
No sign of 'em...
It's not over, Brynner.
Is Elvis out?
That little geek is my...
One of our units is pursuing a suspect up the thirty-...
Who's your suspect?
Mason?  No, he's a soda-jerk drifter, a hamburger flipper.
Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less...
...the master of his realm.
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
...-m-means, Mason.  
What?  Say again, Ma-...
...-son.
What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...
...beer.
Let me see your...
...hands!
You redneck idiot, do you have...
...tunnel now!
All right, go.
The usual.  Doc.

Arlo.

How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
That's right.
Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
Sir?
Do you know him?
Too bad?
Why is that funny?
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
My daughter.
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
Just find the girl.
No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
Either that or she'll be in jail.
What's that, Curly?
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.
Jake, listen.
I said okay, Jake.
I've been wanting to meet you.
Why?
That's just lovely.
How are you, Lou?
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
Oh yes.
No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.
How do you happen to know her?
I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
That's it?
Well, let's go.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
A complete surprise?
You left your keys in the ignition.
I got your check in the mall.
Did you have affairs?
Yes... why?
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
What? What is it?
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
What were you doing there?
Yeah.
Where?
I saw him.
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
You mean she just found out?
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
What are you saying?
...no...
I said the truth!
Back to Mexico.
You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
Sophie.
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
Oh no.
Who?
Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
I said, the northwest valley.
Yes...
Yes?
Of course not.
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
He's not in, Mr.?
It's personal. Has he been out long?
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
Not exactly.
I'm working for his daughter.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
You must not come here! How many times do I have to tell you?  If the film catches fire, runt that you are, you'd go up in a burst of flame...whoosh! And turn into a piece of...
Alfredo, did you know my father?
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
Yes. I want proof.
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
Thanks for all you've done for me.
Hi. Why are you running?
For what?
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here.  Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing...  I'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy lunatic! 
So what's that got to do with it?
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein.  A new broom sweeps clean.
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
He made an awful lot of money.
He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that.  He put all his ambition on that girl.  After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  Oh, I don't blame Susie -
Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.
Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic.  I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
That's Leland, isn't it?
Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet -
I know it is, Brad -
I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie.  You haven't got any idea -
Charlie, please don't -
Toothache.
Thanks.
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
Would you sing for me?
Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Half past eleven.
I mean it.  Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -
You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want.
You do anything you want to do. The people of this state can decide which one of us to trust.  If you want to know, they've already decided. The election Tuesday'll be only -
I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -
Get Dr. Corey.
I'd like to talk to you about that.
Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
Why is she leaving me?
There's no reason why this - this savage personal note -
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
I'll sign those papers -
Mr. Leland, you were -
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
Yes and no.
How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
Are you sure?
I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right?
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
Excuse me, but...
Fifty-five.
How do you know that?
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
What?
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
Sang.
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
Cute cat. What's his name.
That's what I said.
Shocking abuse of authority.
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
Five years.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
Blasphemy.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
I guess.
More or less.
So they build another Death Star, right?
So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
Wait.
The quest isn't going well?
What kind of show?
There aren't.
The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
You know what Sanford told me? 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
It's today.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
Balls resting on his lips.
I could never reach.
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
Why should I loan you my car?
Let me borrow your car.
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
You know what? I don't think I care for your rationale.
Get to work.
And this is what you rented?
Five hundred dollars.
Now I know you're lying.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.
Make them change.
Like ten after.
To talk to you.
You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
Get the fuck outta here already.
Are you open?
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
You know him?
I don't think so.
They are not.
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
No, she's getting married.
What? When? When did all this shit happen?
Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
You used to go out with her?
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?
It's not like it's a demanding job. I'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch TV. The other day I walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping.
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
What were you doing?
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
"Be there?"
Oh, you think so?
Including you?
I'm not the pig you are.
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Something like thirty-six.
I'm going to class.
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
Sure.
I'm not out of shape!
Here you go.
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
No way!
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
That's tight. Solid.
To an Asian design major.
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
Well this is the last time I ever rent here...
You'll be missed.
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
I know. I've been here since eleven.
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
Bye. 
That woulda been cool.
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
Where are you, Walker?
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
How're ya feeling?
Two...
Help me!  I don't want to die!
Enough.
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
I know...
Why are you yelling?
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Maybe lead to a flare up...
A flare up...
What if he can't?
What are you doing here!?
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
Gabe!  Are you alright?
What?
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
No, he's gone.
What's your names?
You and Frank get the tents, thermal clothing, and medical supplies together.
Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.
Where's the third one, Travers?
What about it?
He's alive!
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
Good evening, sir.
Of course. Food alright?
No, my health doesn't allow it.
Thank you, sir.
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.
Hullo.
Fine, sir, fine.
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed.
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
No, sir, I feel really great.
Well, how are you then?
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
I'm gonna be sick.
Alexander de Large, sir.
Yes, sir.
C of E, sir.
Fair hair, sir.
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.
Fine... fine.
You mean like going to the pictures?
Something like that.
I haven't seen you before.
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
Yes.
It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
Can you spare me some cutter, me brother? Can you spare some cutter, me brother? Alex, without looking at him, reaches in his pocket and gives him some money.
Indeed.
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
Carry on, Chief.
Yeah... Pete the English.
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
What?
Sixth is faster.
The ride is free.
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
You're an anomaly in today's world, Max.  You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
When was the last time you took one?
How often you go?
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
This your current address?
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
Lay it on me.
I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
I see.  That was an important list, wouldn't you say?  The people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge.  And you "lost" it?
Federal?
Can you finish on schedule?
Vincent.  Do not cross me.
There was a car here, you can see where the glass came down all around it.  Ivan flew out the window and went bam.
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
I'm sure you're very proud of Max.
I came to see you, you look fine.  We gotta go.
...oh God, don't shoot me...
Jesus, what is with this guy?
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?
It's home.
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
Me, specifically?
Why not?
I think he's dead.
You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX.  Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator.  So we go to Plan B.  Pop the trunk.
I'm gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift with your legs...
How about the thingy next to it?
What'd he do to you?
Please.  Don't do anything.
I can't believe this.
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
Lenny?  You're an asshole.
Collateral damage.
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
Show up for what?
It's not bullshit.
I'll just hold onto it for you.  In case they check.
Our friends in Little Russia.  Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
No.  No way.  I can't do this.
I...I wasn't thinking.  I just did it.
How long have you been a hit man?
Good.  Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing.  Or remember we all die anyway...
You had to kill Heller?!
What's at Union Station?
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
Well.  That was brilliant.
The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
She must be some girl.
I never told her.
Look, I'm sorry --
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
I think you're different.
You bit someone's nose off?
People do have heart attacks.
You saved my life.
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
You want something to drink?
Can you prove any of this?
Was that who I thought it was?
Never, but I've been practicing.
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
So what's the question?
Is this your dad?
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
Did you kill my father?!
Love at first sight?
Someone else might call it stalking.  My dad felt it.  He started carrying a gun.
They'll trace it.
Blue moon...
Without a song in my heart.
Blue moon...
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
That's great.  Good for you.
We've arranged for you to take the blame.  Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
This doesn't make sense.
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
Guy's a C.I.A. shrink.  Here to I.D. Fletcher.  They knew each other somehow.
Which way did he go?
Do you believe me?
What do you suggest?
We've lost contact.
... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
He died...  ... in 1972.
I'm willing to take that risk.
You're --
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
David --
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
You mean --
I don't understand.
You...
They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
You aren't staying?
What...
Got a bogey, boss?
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years.
Some kind of circuitry...?
It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.
Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
It's good to see you, Ellie.
That you, Valerian?
Like it or not.
That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
How do you mean?
'My father's house has many mansions.'
Can you try?
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
What'd you think?
I don't follow.
Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry -- I can't --
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
But --
Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch.
Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow's Saturday. Another week almost made.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
Then how come it ain't done yet?
Here's the Patrol.
In the Navy, we used to call guys --
She looks just like Mrs. Patricia Handy, a married woman... I useta fool with. Man, I kin sniff blondes from a hunnert yards and redheads from a mile and a half.
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
Somebody say somethin'?
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero.
Like I always do?
Thirty-nine... forty... forty-one... forty-two...
What's the writing say?
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
Man, it's so hot.
Cuter again.
Kick a buck.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
But -- but --
You ain't man enough to wear them!
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
What?  What'd I do?
It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
He was lying.
The first two murders.
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
I was?  How you spell that?
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
You get me out first.
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
You know I can't do that.
No.  Not yet.
You're calling me a crank?
Who?
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
Would you want to work with us on this?
Why imitate a dead serial killer?
I'm going to put a guard on your door.
We'll show that to...
But it's a different m.o.
Consistency is the hobgoblin of <u>little</u> minds.  Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with...
You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba.
What happened to you?!
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
They all have one...
You know how to use this?
Hello.  I am  Meryhew Saks.  The song is called "Murder By Numbers."  The performers are a group called The Police.  Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note.  This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. We're not ruling out the possib- ility of three Copycat serial killers.  We have Quantico working on graphology, the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor. It's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims.  We have a team sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want to say a few word to you local people.  Your Commissioner asked for our assistance.  The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police. We couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year.  We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science; you have the local savvy.  Together we can be unbeatable.  Which one is Inspector Halloran?
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
Okay.
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
It's none of my business anymore...
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
What's wrong with him?
Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.
What's Abba?
What the hell you need her for?
You got a suspect...
She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler?  This is the fourth, is that correct?
They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
And her husband? What was he?
Where's the car?
Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
One of your suitors?
After this sort of thing, how do people manage to look at a car, let alone drive one?  I'm trying to find Charles's car.
The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
Do you want a cigarette? I started to smoke at the hospital. It's rather stupid of me.
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
Yes.
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
And the party?
What do you think of this one?
What about this one?
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
I was so sure. I really thought it would work.  We have plans, Ruth.
How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?
Oh no.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Mom, please.
Must you walk so quickly?
I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.
Don't be fresh.
Letty, you should be in bed.
I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
What are you looking to read?
Good God.
What's my rap?
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
What else would you do?
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
No, I need some serious household advice.
Aren't you supposed to throw a bouquet or something?
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
This must be Beast.
The store was busy.
Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
So, another one bites the dust.
I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark.
No...
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
I think I've heard this speech before.
Office work?
What are you doing?
They don't have a murder weapon?
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
Where's your brother?
Uh, yeah.
Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
Hello?
Good.   I'm good.
Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
Why are you here?
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
Uh, no --
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
I only have your word for that.
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
Did you have to use that much explosive?
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
No, I didn't.
I'm the driver.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
Me?
It's my idea.
It's good.
Give it to me, Sami.
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
Anybody know about that car outside?
It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
He speaks about himself in the third person?
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
And you don't speak French?
And how do we do that?
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
Okay.    Okay.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
Yes.
Do you think you are a real master?
Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
Why do you want to teach me?
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
Hello.  What is your name?
Please sit.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
I've missed you.
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
Not another lecture!  On guard!
What I've always wanted, to teach you.
When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since.
Come with me to Peking.  You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
What do you have in mind?
Care for a hot dog?
Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?
Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
Could be.
It's only a flesh wound.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
You look like a rock star without a job.
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
Another jolly nickname?
T-Bird?
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
Blow yourself, bigmouth.
Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
An unexpected pleasure.
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
Who got himself what?
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
I don't think so.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
Junior.
You did?
A friend wrote me.
Romantic? He rapes her.
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
At this hour? I don't think so.
What? Another letter from your friend?
Who?
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
Sure. Have a good night.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
You really want to know?
Where are you going?
Why aren't you understanding?
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
Well, I guess it's getting late. Please thank Kathryn for the use of her Steinway.
I'm in the bath, mom.
Are you for real?
That was cool.
Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
I don't know.
It's like a secret society.
I'm sorry that was out of line.
Where are you going?
I'm taking a shower.
No.
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
No. This is going to be our last session.
Yummy.
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
Greg, is that you under the covers?
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
Is she with you?
And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
Why not?
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
What's your plan of attack?
Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
You amaze me.
Morning!
With who?
She shot you down.
Exactly the opposite.
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
Oh yes.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
To my triumph, of course.
Didn't you hear what I said?
Get out!
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
I said, do you want some water?
But you don't keep a cat, do you?
Does she go up to the Farren's often?
What do you mean?
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
Are they nice?
She was very pretty.
Irena.
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
I think I should.  3000W?
Where did you get it?
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
She said something about that, Mrs. Reed  but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
Hello, Amy.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
Did you mail then?
Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
Who are you?
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
I shall wear it in my hair!
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
It stands so still.
But why?
Look at my ring.
It's a pretty ring.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
But she's such a nice lady.
Then I'll tell you a story  a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
Hurry, hurry.
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
It's some animal hurt in the woods that made that sound.
What is it, ma'am?
It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
Amy looks happy  seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.
No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.
I mean where on your body?
What does that have to do with me?
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
What the fuck are we going to do?
Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
You're kidding, really?
That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
Knock what off?
You don't have to pee.
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
Where'd you get the bike?
Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in.
This really isn't a good time.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
No?
Are you following me?
You wanna get some coffee?
Used to? Did it stop finally?
I'm sorry.
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
Yeah. Maybe.
Uh.... hi!
No, why?
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
What happened?
No, but thanks for the warning.
Your breasts feel larger.
Be careful!
Worse than this?
No, I have a cat.
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
She's just so... pathetic.
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
I need something to keep me awake.
Thanks.  Just some pills.
Sell maps?
Mnunn.  Cold lately.  That night, couple weeks ago.  That was <u>real</u> cold.  Remember that?
The other one?
They don't speak English...
How will we interrogate them?
Good evening, sir.
Good.
How can I submit this?
I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
Can't let you in...  sorry.
But...  How long has this been happening?
Look!  This is a good one!
Such a joker!  Like your father.
If you like.
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
You've been working too hard.
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
You understand what you'll be doing?
Is this dangerous or anything?
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
A month.
Right and don't embellish.
Mr. President...
Nightmare...
Don't call the Vice President!
Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.
Like how?
Mild stroke?
I mean I've checked everything. Women.  Liquor... Finances.  I went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.
Nobody's got clean kids.
Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
What are you gonna do?
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
I know...  I know...  It's difficult for all of us.  But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country.
I don't think so.
I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
Now he's making stuff up about me.
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
What do you mean?
I care about the homeless.
... How could I what?
... . Ellen.
Oh... Yeah.
Mind if I sit down?
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
You find people jobs?
I know.
What?
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet.  We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
His madness....could be from shock.
What is it?
Sir. It's quite clear that...
The great state of Florida. People came here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new Capital o' the World! Hah! They came here...died...went to hell...and the Devil sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.
Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
Ain't no place safe.
What?
What?
I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours.
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
TONY....TONY....
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
Mary.
What'dya get?
Sounds boring to me.
So don't goddam come!  Please.
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
Yes sir.
You know what really excites me about you?
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
It's Nuwanda.
Then come with me.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Uh-huh.
Dead Poets honor.
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means?
Meeks.
I didn't know you taught.
Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
Yawp!
Again!  Louder!
Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!
You can't live a life for someone else, Neil.  You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me?  Have you shown him your passion about acting?
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Too bad.
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
Wait a minute.  I don't let my parents walk on me.
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
You know me, always taking on too much.
Father, I have the main part.  The performance is tomorrow night.  Father, please.
So what do you think of my father?
But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
Oh..
This play?
We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
Who gives a shit about aft?
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
Noooo!
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
Anti social?
Got it?
How do you know that?
What is it?
You want ME to go up there?
No...
You don't take orders very well, do you?
So?
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
Hanover!! Hanover!!
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
Finnegan, what the hell was that?
Joey... Which way's aft?
Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?
I've never seen you so congenial with a mamber of the opposite sex... The two of you got a nice patter going...got a nice rapport...
I'll get the boots.
Who's going?
Ammo! Get the ammo!
This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it.
Who's full of shit?
I thought that was it.
Let's go!!!
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious!
But of course! Please make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --?
You know a guy named Merle?
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!
Holy shit!
No?
What?
Will you marry me?
What kind of beer would you like?
I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car...  I thought someone stole you away!
It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
No-o-o!
How extremely clever. That is really most extraordinaire... Allow me please to introduce myself. I am Armand... And you are?
No. No, no.
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
Won't we? Right? Am I right?
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
You do?
The shot?
Fucking A.
Is he from here?
Hey, Nick?
Huh?
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you!
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
Watch it, shithead!
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
See you Monday.
Listen, Nick --
I'm gonna stay here, Nick.
It's Merle, Sal.
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
Who is it?
My man Dubbs.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
Mug sheets.
Remember my promise.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
Fine.
Sir, your limo's here.
Are you a cop?
See those guys?
You can't catch this man with a computer.
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
Good night, Wade.
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
Wanna try?
How ya feeling?
You be careful.
Demolition Man.
You never want to find out.
I'm going to be a policeman.
The people, Jabez -- the people.
That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?
Lying to you -- Why should I?
And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
And what about Daniel Webster?
Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!
Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
But I like the new one better.
I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
Howdy, Hank.
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Yes, why shouldn't it?
It's mine?
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
I don't care.
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to --  Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice.
I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
Well -- I -- I-
Isn't that your own fault?
He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
It shows on your face.
You must go now, Mary -- you must!
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
Helps sometimes to say it.
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
Ma -- is she? --
Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away!
It is.
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things.
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
It even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it?
Me?
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
I want someone to talk to ...
It's okay, it's okay.
So, you go on upstairs to the party, your lady sees you, you run into each other's arms.  Music comes up, you live happily ever after, that it?
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works.
John, I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy...
What am I, a method actor?  Hans, babe, put away the gun.  This is radio, not television...
Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
Encourage them to be bolder.
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --
I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.
'Roy'.
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
Two.  And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
Roy?  You still with us?
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
...because you hurt me, God how you hurt me.  Can you imagine, marrying another man?  Did I do something to make you do that?  Did I ever turn you down, or anything?  The only thing I couldn't do, you're gonna laugh, is go on top - I got this fear of high places!  And I let myself get fat.
Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.
Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry!
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
That's it.
I know!
What am I supposed to do?
I know I am.  I know!
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
They won't talk to you.
Leon?  Whatsa matter?  They give you a shot down the hospital or what?
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
Yeah.
What are you doin' in there?
You alone, or you got confederates?
I got Sal.
Call me Sonny-boy.
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
... armed robbery ...
When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
What the fuck do you want?
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
Okay, is the vault open?
It's all we got.
Hello... I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now... I suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow. What is your name?
I swear to God... on my salary, I'm not gonna be any hero...
Where's the back door?
Mulvaney...
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
What if I take you with me?
You know ... I like you people ... I really do.
Yeah?
What is it, Sam?
When was the last time you saw Sal?
Yeah.
You shouldn't start now.
Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
Where's the money?
You mean that?
But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
Dead or alive?
Okay, Sal ... what do we do?
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
I never been up in a plane before.
Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay.
No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
Bullshit!
Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
What can he do, he's clean...
Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.
Listen, I'll never make it.  I'll have to go to the toilet.
What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
Oh - Maria!
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
No!
Did Pop come down?
Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card.
Newsman, not ...
What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ...
Who the hell is that?
Where are we going?
<i>I'm calling from the Kappa Epsilon Gamma house at California University.</i>
<i>What happened to them?</i>
I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
Yes.
That's the rumor on the street.
Take us to Vegas. <b> EXT. DESERT ROAD -- DAY </b> The crew rides in the back of the Wanderer's truck toward Vegas. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Domino stares at Taryn as she returns to the table.
Cunt.
<i>I was asleep in mum's guest house.</i> <b> INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Domino is asleep in bed. The TELEPHONE rings.
Hello?
Everyone... please give Domino her space. Step back, please!
What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?
Three tours? Isn't that... <i>twelve years?</i>
They need to get the introduction on camera. Just play along, alright?
This could break new ground in terms of traditional host models. It's self-reflexive reality television.
I own a brownstone on this block.
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa?
No!
OK.  OK.
My name is Eddie.
I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
How would I know how much it's gonna cost if I don't know what I'm buying?
Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.
I'm getting paid...
Yeah, me too.
It's a fucking shame.
Can you pay me now?
You know you don't get paid till we close tonight.  We're still open.
I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
Mookie, I always liked you.  Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you.
It's supposed to be even hotter today.
I work too, but I still make time.
I'm gonna take off ya clothes.
Of course I'm sweating.  I'm burning up.  It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
Shut up.  The Boss!  Bruuucce!!!!
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
Fuck you.  Anyway, Minister Farrakhan always talks about the so-called "day" when the Black man will rise.  "We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past."  You really believe that shit?
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass.
That's what you think?
Get the broom.
Good.  I want you to listen.
Mookie's OK.
You listening to me?
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
Sal's Famous Pizzeria, yeah, two large pizzas, pepperoni and anchovies, hold on...  See, Pop, Mookie fucking talking on the phone and people are trying to call in orders.  He's making us lose business.
Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
How ya doin', Mookie?
Oh my god, are you alright?
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
Just down the hall.
Then a sleep-over is okay by me. Okay boys, eat up.
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
I think it's just over there.
Cool.
Why not?
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.
H A R R Y...
One day they'll find a cure.
We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
Your mom made a move on me.
LLOYD, she's my mom.
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
What's with horse-boy, now he's a bright shiny sun?
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
You're it.
These are really cold, huh?
Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been my partner.
I kinda screwed things up.
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
HARRY!
HARRY! I found the treasure!
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
A blimp.
Cute puppy.
Hey, look. Ice cream.
You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.
I... found that rock.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
Why ith dat newth?
That's it. I'm done.
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
You really are a pirate.
Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?
Okay.
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
How was that?
Your assignment is to pick the class. Find some other students just as special as you.
Will that be on the midterm?
Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke.
I can turn on all the faucets in my house.  Even the hose.
God, I've missed you.
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
The Duke is to be addresses as... -- Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.
Basically...
I'm sorry Gurney.
What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
Would you really have drawn my blood?
Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within.
It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife.
Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.
Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
You've worn a stillsuit before?
No.
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
... Many men have tried.
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Uh, beg to differ.
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
The <u>women</u>?
Ugh!  I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  She doesn't show 'em the proper respect.
Do you want me to get it for you?
Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
Ah, so I pull the strings!
You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
How 'bout a western?  People love westerns.
But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
Should I call a doctor?
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
I never said I could ad-lib...
Really?
So why didn't you do it?
But maybe not.
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Huh?
Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...
Don't you have any savings?
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
Don't worry.
Okay.  But what if I'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower?
You really think so?
What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
These shoes are itchy.
Dolores, give me your shoes.
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
You got the job?!!
Better than not getting a job?
No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice.
This is my way of telling you --
It takes me comfortable.
Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
Hruphh...?
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
I like to think so.
What is happening?
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
You gotta be kiddin' me.
What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
Oh, hi.
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
Oh.  Okay.
I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
Well you tried --
The sun.
I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?
Yes!
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
What do you love her or something?
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
Ed --
Ed --
What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
Mr. Pekurny.
Yes?
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
I thought -- I thought he was dead.
You said that.
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
Right.
Send him away.
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
He had girlfriends!
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
If I don't call you "Dad" it' just because... 1 was already a big boy when you came into our lives --  or when I thought you came into our lives --
And what did he come back now for?
Eddie...
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
Hi, Mom. 
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
I batted!
Right.
Really?
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
I know, I ...
Come on, let's go.
Okay.
Are you all right?
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
Kinda'.
What do you mean all of a sudden? You've been going with her six months.
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
Why do you do that?
I'm doing all right.
I don't know.
Okay, I just wanted to get your attention. My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and I design video systems. You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
You don't recognize me.
No. Two times.
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
How?
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
How'd it go?
Yeah. No. I mean, you know.
Dick... Dick,..
What?  Right.  So let's start counting.
Well, good luck there, Tracy
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.
I hope so
Well, that speech she gave -- it was pretty, you know, pretty out there.  But we'll get to the bottom of it.  Don't you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to see to that.  Right, Jim?
Walt needs to see you.
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
I don't believe you.
Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
Hey Yeah?
Three twenty-five.
You're there.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -
Where 're you going?
Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
She's doing this to get back at me
Thought what?
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
Yeah.
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
How'd she meet Patchett?
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
So you saved her.
Did you talk to Exley?
Call me Dudley.
Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
<u>What do you want</u>?
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide.
What are you talking about?
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
Ellis Loew.
What about him?
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
I don't know him.  Mr...
No.
Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now.
Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
And?
I... No.
Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?
That's right.
What about you?
I want you to follow Bud White.
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
What's that for?
What's Fleur-de-Lis?
Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
Why's she seeing Bud White?
Really?  What did White say?
How about White?
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
Is she?
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
Not a word.
And Reynolds?
Around.
What's wrong, Trash?
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
Brill?
No one. But I'm a little nervous.
I'm doing a transfer now.
Tell us about Rachel Banks.
Who are they?
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
No shit.
And you won't. Now move--
You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
Did you call anyone?
You told me no calls.
I intercepted phone calls.
How'd you have the manpower to--
Who?
Drive.
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
What about newspapers and magazines?
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
What if we just fucked with 'em?
How?
Is Jerry Delsano in?
Who's calling?
Do you see anything you like?
That's fine.
Thanks.
Because my life is being ruined.
Your stuff?
Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
Was he with anyone?
I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, <u>way</u> outa line.  You understand?
What do you mean?
Bobby?
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
Sorry.
How could you let me find out like this?
I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
Oh, please--
I think you should leave now, Robert.
I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
What is it?
I'm sorry about Rachel.
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
It tastes like fish.
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
Do you like fish?
"Soon". Or at least sooner than never.
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
What makes you think it's you?
It's not me?
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
--otherwise we may have to--
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
I got a call this morning from a source I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation.
I don't under--
Some of 'em.
Alright!
They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
That's what I want to talk to you about?
Ssh!
My stuff's all over her apartment.
I don't know. I mean--
Why would the NSA--
I don't know!
You're tired.
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
I'm sorry, man.
I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--
Why not?
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
No sir.
Dean's with Lyle.
So they know everything.
It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
Thank you.
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
Actually, you sing.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
Shall we be all right?
Will you please come in?
I'm impressed you can sew.
Say you're sick.
No.
I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
No.
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
We've got to get you out of here.
It's so cold.
Yes.  Absolutely.
What kind of photographs?
Sorry, what's your point?
Look, either shut up, or go home.
I told you so.
I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
What do you want?
So you can shoot a pistol?
Hana?  Hana?  Are you alright?
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
What if I told you he did this to me?
She can take you as far as Florence.
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
The rest meant nothing to me.
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
The team is in mourning, darling.
Darling, I just heard.  You poor sausage, are you all right?
Aren't you?
Candaules
I can already see.
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
I'm not sewing anything else for you!
Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
Kip - come and dance with me
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
Of course.  When?
It's what I've learned.
He's sleeping.
Yessir.
I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
I don't think so.
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
This is wonderful!
What are you talking about?
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
We're getting close.
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
He's on to something bigger.
Mr. MacDougal.
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you?
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
We going somewhere?
Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
It's one way.
You're late.
And good morning.
We're doing this together. We're partners.
Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
A dozen times.
You can't be too careful.
Careful...careful.
It's your mistake.
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
What about the rules?
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
That's where the Mask comes in.
So how long till we do this?
Can't be too careful.
Pulse detectors.
Not for me.
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
Don't panic, now, there's no rush...
The disc is still in there.
Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
This is big enough.
I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
Anna?  With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
What the hell is this doing here?
I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
What?  Hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.
So you say.
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
I don't even know how much money that is.
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
Yeah?
Where's Anna?
You do know how to do that, don't you?
I want a raise.  And benefits.  Including dental.
I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.
Then I don't get anything either.
That's crazy -- why not?
Bullshit.
What now?
And that's what caused the contamination?
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
You didn't care about my case?
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?
You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
Why not?
Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
Ho - ly - shit.
I wasn't gonna --
Two million dollars?
Who's the judge?
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
You come to the right place.
I guess I did.
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
I hate it too.  I hate this trip.
Yeah.  A real moron.
I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise.
She's one of the sick people?
Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different.  Let's start over.  My name's George.  What's yours?
I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
How?
What are you doing here?
I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
I know.  It's an awful lot.
Uh-huh?
What?
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
It was .... the Emperor ....
Much anger in him, like in his father.
He can do it.
Well, it's been awhile.
Barks at Han.
Barks at his master.
Yeah ...
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
Our destruction?  Who?
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
Now you're making sense.
There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
They're moving away.
Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
What are you staring at?
I was worried about you.
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
We have no use for your kind.
What?
A tremor!
Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about Han.
I have followed my feelings.
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?
Zira, are you mad?
You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
You told me he was dead.
Shit.
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
All right, so I made another deal.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
See you in hell, Snake.
That's the deal.
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
No.
She's in the green.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
Does he know how to activate it?
Where are they?
Location.
Not yet.
How do you know all this?
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
Who?
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
Snake - what is it?
What the hell is this?
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
At last...
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
He can be no other.
Yes.
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
Why can't you be my champion?
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
The law forbids it.
Why didn't he kill us?
The King without his sword, the land without a king...
You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
To kill and be king, is that all?
You're convinced that it's genuine.
Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will.
It's-
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Oh, she'd love it.
Rats?
Yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps.
There is nothing.
A man to see you.
And those lies she's been telling?
Hey, come on, I'm grown-up. What'd she say? I mean specifically, Doctor.
The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
Why, I don't understand?
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
Where?
You've been playing with it?
Wait a minute you need two.
He's nice.
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
How do you know?
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
Oh my God!
Honey this is Father Dyer.
Think you can sleep?
Do you like films?
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I! Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! Nirrem! Nirrem!
Okay
Let the enemy have no power over her.
And let my cry come unto thee.
See the cross of the Lord. Be gone you hostile power. O'Lord hear my prayer.
The Lord be with you.
Amen.
What is it?
Can you give her something?
I've seen him.
I once did a paper on it
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
Yes.
I don't know.
No.
Give me the keys!
It's my goddamn car!
It's our goddamn car!
Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
Well, look at this.
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right before the accident.
Accident?
Out.
When they coming in?
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
That's not the point.
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
Jack.
Count it.
Fuck him.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
We gotta go, Jack.
So what'd we get her?
We don't get a gig.
No?
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
What?
What are you, crazy?
Oh, brother.
Hey, Frank.
Just a lucky guess.
So what do you think?
She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
All night?
We're gonna be here a week?
Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
Thank you, thank you.  You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family.  Right, Jack?
How dare you say you love me.
Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?
They stopped serving two hours ago.
What are you talking about?
He was wearing a suit.
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
You're making things up, Frank.
Cancel, Frank.
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
I don't know.
What channels it on?
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
Your limo's ready, Ma.
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
So?
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
Where's your dress?
Maybe it's legit.
Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.
Baker's unabridged.
What's with you guys?
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
Whatcha doin' over there?
Where's egghead?
It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
I can keep the beat.
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
Long story.
He had a mind that escalated things.
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
Losing his teeth.
Another five years, huh?
Did you break a cup, Jack?
In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.
My days are not the old days, genius.
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
Oh?
I guess it's getting serious.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Older than me.
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
Okay.  How'd yours go?
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
That's not the worst part.
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
Not anymore.
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
What are you -- stupid?
Castor's escaped!
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
Just following your example.
What do you know about it?
The hospital.
What is with you tonight?
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
Adelle?
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
Jack, are you okay?
No.
This isnt my real life. Its just a glimpse...
You know how to make chocolate milk?
Where do I go now?
Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
I dont think so.
Hey Jack, youre all flush.  I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
It wouldnt really be cheating...  Its complicated.
Got a minute, Jack?
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!
Its a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
You cant do this. You cant keep coming in and out of peoples lives, messing things up...
...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  Merry Christmas and shit...
What!?  Look at the ticket...!
Evelyn, right?
Are we finally being honest?
Frank.  Wheres Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
Are you okay?
What are you doing?
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if Im lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...Im sick of it.
Its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
Look, Im sorry.  Im sorry I was such a saint before and Im such a prick now.  Maybe Im just not the same guy I was when we got married...
Well...Annie for one.
Good, Jack.  Maybe well keep her.
You had a heart attack?
Our life in a nutshell...
Not it...?
Cmon, Jack, you think there arent mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell Im doing in New Jersey...
Good things...
Dont do that...
Dont do this, Jack... But he continues...
No...
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, Ill be fine...
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, lets get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
He certainly has your number, Alan.
For one thing, you like expensive things.
For the money, theyre hands down the best radial we carry...
Relax, it's casual.
What about his first born?
This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
No more cracks about how I look.
Oh, he did.
What do you mean "complete"?
This is wrong in so many ways.
This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
And where do we think we're going?
You're hot!
You're really cramping my style here.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
They're ready for you, sir.
Leonard, how's the feed?
How's the IPO?
<u>Ben</u> did this?
Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
There were a lot of variables to consider --
The less time, the better.
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
What is it?
Right, sir.
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
That's beside the point now.  I don't see the sense of going on.
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
Doctor...you can't mean that! Not when we've come this far. And if we give up, there'll be no way of saving Mr. Benes --
Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
We're pushing oxygen today.
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
I'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that'll do it.
If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
What can we do?
Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber -- one of the countless Alvioli of the Lung -- and we can't get enough to fill a microscopic tank.
Doctor, we've just about had it.
At an operation?
Sounds like heavy artillery...
At this size, I would certainly think so.
In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless?
We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
I'm married.
Atomic fuel?
That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
Yes, there is.
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
This is a new car, then, sir?
What's this, sir?
I don't know. Few munce.
What?
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
Clear him off the road.
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
Three people. In Brainerd.
Oh, geez.
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
Blood has been shed. We've incurred risks, Jerry. I'm coming into town tomorrow. Have the money ready.
Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
I thought you'd never ask. The older one is Janet, she's nine, and the younger one is Morgan.
Just a general way.
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
He was a little older. Looked like the Marlboro man.
Yah?
I'm talkin' about your potential.
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
...If it's so damned important to ya!
Yah, real good. How you doin'?
Yah, so we're all set.
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Jerome Lundegaard?
I know it's a lot.
How ya doin', Wade?
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
What the heck were you thinkin'? Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank interest, I'd look for complete security. Heck, FDIC. I don't see nothin' like that here.
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
All the more reason!  I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up.
...There's a million dollars here!
Put you in touch with Grimsrud.
Well, that's okay, I just -
Geez, you okay, Margie?
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
Yah.
Well, how the heck are ya?
No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
Better times.
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
Linda Cooksey?
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Whose car?
...Chief Gunderson?
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.
...How's the paintin' goin'?
He's at Norstar.
That wouldn't interest you.
Where's Tyler?
The first rule of Project --
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
I must've left the original in the copy machine.
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
What does that mean?
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
I could check your prostate.
... A person.
Guy or girl?
Can I come in?
We did make love?
What did you say... ?
Say my name.
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
You got about thirty seconds.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
You are an insane person.
Why are you doing this?
Tell the other person how you feel.
We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
No, supply oxygen?
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
Huh?
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
Go ahead.  Say it.
Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.
Strange.
Call what off?
Anyone?
Same here.
What car?
"I am Joe's Lungs."  It's written in first person.  "Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells."  There's a whole series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
You're okay with this?
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
... Marla ... ?
Six months advance pay.  Six months!
Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it about you and me?
What the hell ... ?!
You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
I don't know!  Nothing!
I want to hear the truth.
Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
What about Marla?
What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants?  We both use that body.
I quit.
It's out of our hands.  This is it.
What?
What?
Who is this?
Why?
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
I didn't beat it; I hid from it. If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it.  Don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others.  That's the worst killer of them all.
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
What do you want me to do?
What did you see?
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
That lucky bastard.
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
Calm down, Kimmy.  It's not drugs, just weed.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Yeah?
What's going on here?
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
Tell me again how it started.
I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
Kimberly?  It's Dad.
I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
Mom?
That's why I was there last night.
That... him?
I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?
Most kids do, I guess.
I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.
You know what to do.
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
... to target at Ban Kia Na.  We probe the site...
What do you call that?
What's this?
How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
Roundeye.
You better take off.
Yes.
You comin'?
It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
I do?
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
What?
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
Can you walk?
Hello, John.
There were treating me like a headcase.
I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?
Will it hurt?
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
What does that mean?
See, I told you!
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
You're kidding!  What did he say?
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
Yeah, I know the place.  It's one of those chic <u>yuppie</u> gathering holes.
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?
Tragedy?
I wanna go...Just let me go...
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
Who?
Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
Happily married, probably.
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
No just Parry.
It sounds exciting.
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
No.
No, I...
Well, id'n that nice.
You're not going to play it again.
You said.
I can't help it, honey, the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me...
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
You treat me like I was.
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
No.
Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!
No. How much do I owe you?
No substitutions.
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
Tea.
Oh.
He's not... They feel he... maybe he might not recover, and that he'll either...
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
Uhm hmm.
Do you want some gingerbread?
Where is she, anyway?
You were going without saying goodbye?
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
Why?
I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...
You don't call that music, though.
No, it isn't what I think.
I don't think that's accurate...
Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
I don't find your language that charming.
Is he?
Robert?
Oh. You have to tell me that.
Yes.
That'll make you happy.
Robert, do you mind?
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.
Don't call me "mack," honey.
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
Why you have an attitude for?
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
Who are you?
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
Wussup, Victor.
Wha'?
For real?
Positive.
My friend told me she lived around here.
God I admire you.
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
Wonder who his supplier is.
You're lucky.
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
Fletch.
You can't keep me here.
Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
My God, you're serious.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
I think Id rather have drugs.
The two surfer boys?
You gonna nail the chief?
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
Nothing. They're still there.
Are you all right, Doctor?
Oh my God!
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan.
I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
They bust you every week.
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Who?
I'm all ears.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
I'm still here.
A .357.
Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
They serve dinner on the flight?
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
I have this effect on lots of women.
What's he doing in Utah?
Hi.
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
What are you talking about?
But I've seen the deed.
What's wrong, Gail?
I think you better sit down.
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
Who are you?
I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
Just give me a hint, all right?
I have some ideas.
What...
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
But I ain't got you...
I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
You wish.
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
My axe!
This way...
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Gut feeling.
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
You need it.
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
It's me.
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
What's fine?
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
What?
How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
Boca?
What?
Who knows?
Takin' care o' business, honey.
Sal --
What's your name, asshole?
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Il est en retard.
Une erreur!  C'est génial.  C'est une vedette à la télévision.  Il peut aller partout sans être soupçonné... En plus il a besoin de fric.
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
There'll be someone else.
You're in show business.
What?
Where from?
Yeh?  Who else?
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
Who stuck up the laundromat?
Never trust a nigger.
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?
No sir -- this is where Joel lives.
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
Forty dollars -- was $250.
There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.
What was it?
What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.
You remember Mary Finelli?
Where's the collar, in the cells?
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
You're shitting me!
Baltimore?
Oh, yeah.  Damn.  My watch is busted.
Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
You okay, man?
Frank...what's wrong?
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
What is going on here, Satch?  What are those guys doing out there?
What do you mean?
I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
How's that?
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
I'm scared.
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
Uh huh...
What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?
What?
Dad...?
You sound...ground up...?
Why?
When?
What kinda twisted animal.
Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
What are we like in...1998?
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
I'm right here, Dad.
John, he's got my driver's license.
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
My father didn't die in a fire?
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
What?
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
A hot shot, huh?
Nah, just working the job.
Huh.
What is that?
We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look.
How about a roll in the hay?
I'm a slow eater.
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
What's this?
A hammock?
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
Is that so bad?
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
No.  I got here just before you did.
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...
In that little thing?
Are they following us?
I don't see anything.
I just want you to like me.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
....with a woman's touch.
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
Lake Forest Green?
You mean you had a bad dream.
But what if they try and scare us?
So where's Cort gone off to?
What's goin' on?
I've seen it.
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
Jason Voorhees is dead.
No, I --
Look, I don't want your money!
I know everything about you, Diana.
Good night, beautiful.
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
Why did you want her body?
Lock this asshole up.
She's beautiful.
Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
Okay.
Look, I know I treated her bad --
That's disgusting.
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
Have you seen Tamara?
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
Well...how do you feel?
What's wrong?
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
I demand to know what is going on...
He is not.
You're telling a lie.
I...I can't...
I'm staying.
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
Get in the boat, Rennie!
I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
Rennie...
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
But Rennie...
What did you find?
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
What happened eighteen months ago?
Don't wait Efor me.
Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
How do you Eknow.
Paisley Porter.
Had to be him.
This could be it.
Does it feel comfortable?
This could be it.
Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
She died.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
Our Peter?
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
This is how we've managed to last.
I go to college. I thought you knew.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
First you tell me.
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
What's sexy?
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
How prominent?
I am really, deeply sorry.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
What's it like to shoot somebody?
People are dependable.
All the failures, all the fatalism.
What did it say?
This could be it!
Life is true.
What do you want?
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
They're only gonna lose.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
I know, Pop.
What do you want me to do?
Matthew's my grandson.
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
Then say it.
Postpone. We have every right.
To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
I have excellent long-term memory.
Yes.
You've worked with Elliot?
Say it again.
Is it true?
Home.
What do you expect when you talk like that?
You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man.
Enough.
What are you doing?
"Hell!"
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right?
They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
I dined at the prison.
It's for the best.
How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
Twelve have a mission within the week.
Hello.
Suit yourself.
It needs work.
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!
What makes them think that?
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
Where are we going?
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
How do I square the accident?
Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
Friend?
What about the car?
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
What is it?
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
And you got him...
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
I'm in a hurry.
One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
Where do you want to go?
Assumed name... Houston.
After four years and now the question comes up.
Really?
So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
I don't want to go there.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
She's on TV.
He must have.
There better be a guy with the
What do you want to do?
Only one car.
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
Sounds good.
You want to try with me?
Okay.
So what?
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
What now?
Can I help you?
Chicago.
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
What do you have in mind?
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
Then you do it.
How was that?
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
Let's just get to the border.
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
A Ford... We have a Ford.
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
You knew what I'd do.
What's it got to do with you?
This is my brother's car.
Oh ay?
Yeah.
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
What about?
That's not good enough.
Christ, what...
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.
Where's he living these days?
Everyhing go off all right?
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Why'd you see him so regular?
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
It is. Honestly.
While he was here. You went about together?
So where are we going, Princess?
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
And you didn't know her last name?
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.
It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  It's a bloody funny thing.
You coming to South America?
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.
Why would it?
Where you off to?
Definitely.
You don't look it.
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
What'll they do to him?
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
What you doing around here then?
Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?
Oh, you've been watching television.
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
Yeah.
Nasty way to go.
To get on the...
What?
We're stuck with this...
Eh?
For some sales pro...
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
That's right...
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
No.
What?
Someone should stand up and strike back.
Somebody...
Someone should rob the office.
How do you know he'd buy them?
Did you?
Did I say that?
Did you talk to Graff?
For five thousand?
However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.
Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
...you don't have to come in...
Me?
Absolutely.
I can't close 'em.
I am?
He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
They stole...
They stole the phones.
Were the leads...
To the cops?
Why don't you think so?
Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
You understand?
Did they catch...?
Did the leads come in yet?
Read it.  Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.  What happened here?
Wh...wh...Wha...?
The leads come in, I'll let...
Just go to lunch.
...did they...
...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
...it isn't you...?  Who is it? Who is this I'm talking to?  I need the leads...
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
Murray said...
Yes.
Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me?
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
What?
I sold them to Jerry Graff.
Uh-huh?
Wait...uh, look...  Look, twelve, twenty, two, twen... twenty-five hundred, it's...take it.  Take it all...  Take it!
My ass.  I told 'em.  Listen to this: I said...
Give me some leads.  I'm going out... I'm getting out of...
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
They took the phones...
Fuck you, Dave...
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
Twelve-fifteen.
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
Ricky, I...
Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
Monday.
Three business days.  They mean three business days.
You don't count Saturday.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
What was yesterday?
I told you.
She told me I have to.
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...
This.
It's nothing.
Guess who?
You just this morning...
We haven't got a lead...
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
They took some of the con...
Do you like them?
 You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?
 He's going to kill Fanucci.
You're not my father!
No.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
The children can stay.
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. Of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, I'll dip my beak just a little.  Just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan?
Oh, 'scuse me.
It was hard to have him killed.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
No.  I mean, are you sure?
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
What is it?  Can I help?
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
The 'patrone' is here.
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
Where's my wife?
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.
What do you mean gone?
Will you tell him?
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you.  It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust.  In time, you'll understand everything.
But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
Where's my brother?
They can come in now.
Was it a boy or a girl?
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
That plane goes to Miami...
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
Good.  Then you're staying.
No questions.
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want.
This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station.
Very impressive.
It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not.
No.
When do we talk?
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
Don't I look like I'm listening?
How much more a month?
What was that?
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here.  Someone who's done things with his life.
I didn't mean to...
What're you talking about?
Something I can do for you?
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
And your name is --?
I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea.  I'd like it very much if you'd join me.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
You mean, like posed for pictures?
But why?
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks.
I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
Do you mind?
No.
No.  I could have, though.
So you had a wife?
So we understand each other?
Sorry.  Not today.
Not at the moment.
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
I don't hear anything.
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
Is that --?
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
I can undress myself, thank you.
Calm down, Clay.  Just calm down. We'll watch it.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.
That's as good a way as any to describe it.  I've seen far worse cases.  You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?
In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
I have a proposal, Mr. Kay.  This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think?
Mr. Whale?  Are you all right?
My monsters?
Can we get together while I'm in town?  I so badly want to sit for you again.
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
What's with the fish thing -- ?
I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
Jesus, man ... What'd you do?
Sound it out for me.
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
What for?
I know you --
How's that?
I know you.
I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
No...
I know you.
You guys have any skills at all?
You look good...
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
He's in some trouble ...
I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
You all right -- ?
This has nothing to do with any of that --
So what are you gonna do?
I can handle it --
"Shadow games?"
Price of doing business...
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
You know of one -- ?
Mitch.
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?
I think so... They're just... So ...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
Where to -- ?
Is he still working here ?
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
What did you hear about that thing?
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
Take it easy.  We can talk about it.
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
Then you're safer in here.
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
I gotta talk to you.
Oh yeah? Anything you say.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.
I don't want them left back.
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
You want a partner?
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
How's the woman?
Week after I'm twenty-one.
No, I had to talk him down.
What class?
Ah, history I think.
Okay.
Yah, all right...
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?
Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
What's your name?  Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here.
Hey fuck you.
If I agree to this, I walk right now?
--That edge!
Shall we start the, uh...
Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.
That's fine, but did you ever think--
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
What are you smiling at?
I can come back.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
Thank you.
Good to see you.
I didn't see you at the reunion.
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
Since Nancy died.
They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.
Can we do it at my office?
Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit.
I'll be okay.
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
Just...take it easy, Gerry.
What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with--
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
Why there?
There is somebody...
I could go for a Whopper.
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.
You're right. I know.
Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a "shrink kit" that comes with all these volumes included?
What did you think?
I did.
You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
Nautilus?
Yeah. Do you paint?
Tell me what you really think.
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
What is?
You've never been out of Boston.
No, I don't.
Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
It's not your fault.
Don't fuck with me.
Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.
Yeah, I think so.
What?
Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Not a chance.
Do you keep in touch with them?
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.
All right, all right. We'll go.
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
Some, a little.
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
How do you know that?
Then what are you afraid of?
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
No, you don't want to hear that.
Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
But it ain't runnin' away, Ma. All I wanta do is go away with another fella an' look aroun' for work by ourself--
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
You bust outa jail, Tom?
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
Kids?
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
Joad. Tom Joad.
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
Why, you're the preacher!
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
Been out travelin' around?
Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.
She's settlin'.
I ain't gonna run.
You're right!
What's the matter?
I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.
Sure do.
Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
Now listen, Grampa. Listen to me, just a minute.
You take this.  I ain't hungry.
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
Now don't get sassy, Ma.
Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
Pa! Shh!
How about it, Ma?
Don't taste bad.
Yes'm, that was it.
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
Look, Ma!
Was Granma bad?
Since before they stopped us las' night.
You promised, Tommy.
Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.
Well?
Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!
Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
That's Connie Rivers with her. They're married now.  She's due about three-four months.
I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt.  Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
--Stop it--
--No.
Computer guy.
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...
What am I gonna do?
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
Are you going to the reunion?
That's part of it.
What's that?
You look beautiful.
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
No time.
Is it something you've done?
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
Okay. Repeat this after me.
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
Like a club. Work less, make more.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
There you go. I left it blank.
--Nooo--
He's falling for her. Look at him.
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
It's a place where religious people--
I have a headache. You have a headache?
To shoot you. Correct.
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.
Doesn't matter.
When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too.
Well, that'll be a little complicated --
What?
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
The answer's no.
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
Just make yourself comfortable.
You missed a button.
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
Yeah?
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
Whatever you want.
Fine!
This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this.
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
Did you ask him to come visit?
You got everything you need?
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.
What?... Oh baby...
That's not true.
Good.
Great!
Did you speak to Farlow?
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
Sure... What's Grace up to?
Okay.
"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...
How was the dinner?
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
Good night.
I thought you guys were going to call me.
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
Was the trip okay?
It's so cruel.
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
What?
Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
What?
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
Mmm. An editor.
Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
I don't know if I can.
Sure?
I thought your mom's coming up?
No, not yet.
We still have a way to go.
Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
You ever miss it?
What stuff is that?
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
It's cool!
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
Oh yeah? What's that?
Shh!
What?
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.
One-handed!
Oh wow, we are fried.
Well this hasn't happened yet.
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
Dade?
Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
That's a nice score for a girl.
Think you can do better?
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Are you challenging me?
Your slave?
There they are!
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
You think they're going to bust us?
So what are we supposed to do?
I don't want to go to jail for this.
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
I'll take you down there.
No, no, we have to get out of here right now.
You guys always look great.
Found it.
Honey, I don't think their home.
I do.
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
Night Doc.
Kido. It's four in the morning.
I don't want to.
Jamie, what happened?
Coming.
Rachel come on.
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
Why?
That's all the windows, Dad.
Why don't you go make some coffee.
You won't come on too strong.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Do you?
You look sharp. You understand?
Get the outside shutters.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
Oh Christ. Doc...
It isn't a man.
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
How far are you going, Mr. Sayer?
Sort of.
Sheriff, what is going on out there?
Okay.
You blame everything on kids.
Well, are we still on for tonight?
I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me...
He was watching me.
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
I can't.
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
You idiot!
Is that all you say?
My parents won't be back till ten.
I gotta go.
Where?
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
Are you coming over tonight?
Yes, I am.
..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...
After the movie.
There is no such thing.
No...
There was no one outside.
Promise?
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
Hello.
She's washing her clothes.
There's nothing else I can do.
Are there any special instructions?
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
I couldn't if I tried.
I love that.  That's my type.
Oh, yeah.
That's just --
Yeah.
Well, I live downtown.
What?
Right.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
I can't resist.
We're actresses.
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
Oh, God.
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
No?
Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
Not because of me, I hope.
That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
Was I?
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
Are you angry with me?
No!
Are you?
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!
Absolutely.
Isn't it enough that I can love you?
I can't take this anymore.
Because I have to!
Oh, yes, you have!
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
Hello?
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
You're just realizing this now?
Yeah.  What?
Yes!
Why?
Do you miss Frederick?
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
Wow!
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
You promised to stay on the wagon.
Okay, okay.
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
What?  You're kidding!
Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
Well, how about this?
Sometimes she's terrific...
You treat me like a loser.
You're crazy!  That's not true.
What's the matter?
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
Well, why don't you share them with us?
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
Can we, can we go?
No!
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
We didn't hit it off.
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
Are you, are you out of work or something?
Yeah.
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
Really?
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
You're okay, though, huh?
Oh, I'm fine.
What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
Yeah.
Really?
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
Well, what about me?
Oh, well.
Really?
Oh, wow!
Oh, who cares?
Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.
Hi.
Why are you so upset?
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
...I was <u>working</u>...
I <u>swear</u> to you...
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
It wasn't my day.
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
...aren't you afraid of me...?
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
Rich, comic book freaks.
How crazy is that.
...are they hard to get?
And how would you know that?
Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. 
I don't mind being the token <u>woman</u>, what I'm suggesting, send me out there with a token <u>man</u>... who are these Warriors, ¥our cobbled together Strike Force?  I'm in the room with a fugitive felon...
...what's he got against you?
Not for our Doctor Lechter.  This...  Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand.  It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L...
No. 
I know you did what you could.
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...
She threw a punch at a man on the team.
S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning. 
Waal...
Waited too long, hon...?  
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
How so?
You resemble a figure from the Della Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at Santa Croce.
Who does not?
Where do you live?
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
Indeed we were.
Thank you, Cordell.
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
...which of us is free...?
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
You should get Married.
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
...and then, we're going to <u>Greece</u>...
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
No,I get it, this is my <u>Cavalier</u>.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take <u>this</u>...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
Or clear your windshield with it.
I know it well.
...a Dr. Fell.  A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
...no...
Believe me, I wish I knew less.  Oh, if you weren't such a pig...
Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
You think you're so...but you're just...
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability...
Now what? What did I do this time?
Are we allowed to start hating "Wendy" yet..."Gee Wichita, I guess mosquitoes have always liked me."
You know you just do this for shock value. It's not shocking.
You'll be hiding behind a tree.
You look a like you could use a friend.  You know, I'll never forget my first day at camp. Boy, I was so nervous that I...
I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.
What in the hell did you do that for?
Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
I was thinking...if we could mesh my way of thinking with your way                            ] of thinking, we could really do some                        ] great counseling. It's all about                            ] the evolution of the species, we                            ] can improve...                                              ]
Fuck off.
Do you really think we're fooling anyone?
Not now, Wendy.
God, you're beautiful.
I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month.
Don't say that.
I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.
Things are going to change, Earl.
Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.
I was talking with someone!
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
Very very. The photographs?
You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
No.
You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
And your worst enemy.
We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.
What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
Answer him dick!
Turn that back on!
I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
Hello!
 Got an A, Mum!
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
I'm educating myself!
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
Hello!
John has fallen in love with me!
I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
Mummy!
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here.
Well?
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
Gwen, my wife's dead.
But... I thought...
Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
Oh my God. It's coming out.
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
Ambulance.
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
Dreams?
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
The bathroom!  For two days?
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
Mister LaPlante...
Some guys been looking for me, Chick?  Spanish kinda guys.
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I'm trying to tell you what happened.  What happened is...
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
I snuck in.
Here we are.  Yeah, that's a possibility.  A movie.  Now you gwan in, tell your mother I got you back on time.  Point that out to her. She was always on my case for stuff like that.  She's still like that, right?
Vietnam!
John, I know all about it.
What is it?
The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
Said he's not an actor.
She's talking to him now.
Quit?  She wants to quit?
You didn't... get it on with him?
What about?
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
So this really does the trick, eh?
Where are these toys of yours?
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.
Yeah, right -- I really have to go to bed.
Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.
Have you just plain asked him?
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
C'mon, kids, let's go.
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
It's a nice pool, isn't it?
<u>Now</u>, Neil.  Stop teasing your sister.
How was lunch?
No.
No, I'm not kidding you, <u>Philip</u>.
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
Did the cleaning woman come?
You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.
Who was that?
What?
Are we gonna buy this house?
Is it a king or a queen?
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
We don't have any proof of that.
A few days ago.
You sure?
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
Yes -- I think it is.
Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
I hear you.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas.
I'll go first.
No -- I will.
You guys are from the British museum, right?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I was at the police station earlier today--
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
I don't know.
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
Is it?
Be careful, Conner.
What's that next to him?
It has to be.
I was working on the cataloging.
Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
Why did you wait?
I know.
Don't leave us, Conner.
Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
Why?
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
You get anything on Smith?
Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
What do you want to do?
The best.
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
I'm going to my desk.
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
Jesus.  What is this?
We're cool.
It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone.
I'm here.
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
He needs a doctor.
The cops are comin'!
You got something to say?
You mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?
Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.
I need to work out some stuff.
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
Mine, too.
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
You leave that gun alone!
Please get away from me.
You gotta pee?
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
Is something wrong with Jane?
He didn't say.
Louise?
Go.
I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?
Sounds like you know the job.
You want me to stick around, I could --
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
Special Agent Jones.
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
The kids are in here!
He has lots of disks.
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
Who are you?
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
You want to pay me?
Ten.
Give me it.
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
Paul, you know who this is?
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
Anything. Strong.
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
Excuse me, Colonel.
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it.
The United Nations are still here.
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
Well rewarded Those were his words.
Whiskey?
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
No.
Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
You lie.
Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
It's an order. Get everyone out now.
How do you know?
The third floor are low class rooms.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
They do not have your connections.
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
Paul, don't let them die.
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
So where is the lamb?
I had you transferred to Kigali.
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.
No! Sit down now.
Let me go. Children get off.
Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
When?
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
More the merrier.
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.
I'm better than that.
I don't think so...
Why not?
It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop!
No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store --
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
Or an on-line computer.
What --
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
You okay?
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
Then what the hell are we doing here?
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
-- wit...nesses --
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?
And then what happens?
-- my loss --
It works.
There is something very not normal going on here!
Keep talking, I'll find you!
What was her name?
Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
She's here.
No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
...set up some more things.
Were you fooling with the power?
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
You don't think I know?
Do you think I'm a fool?
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
Oh, that's nice...
Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.
This isn't happening...
No.  But I'm a clairvoyant.  I can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
What?
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
I'm trying to quit.
Taken what?
Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
Terri?
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
Can we see?
Thank you.
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
Yes.
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
JP?
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
I miss you too.
Oh, I don't ...
Yeah right.  Look ...
You're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray.
Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I are going to Rio.  We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  Right, buddy?...
Looks like you've been expanding your...
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
Hmmmm.....
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
You got about five minutes and change.
The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was "Who Shot J.R.?"
Now that's a lock.
Anna, I think you better stay....
I'm a ghost.  Boo.
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
This is the room above the Art Treasures room.  The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created...
Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.
I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....
This doesn't taste like cappuccino.
And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
I wanna know...
I knew it!  I told you it was a fake.
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.
Get away from there, convict!
Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun."
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
Why George, you big softie...
We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
With a little jazz.
Who are you? How did you know who I am?
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...
Cigarette?
You're from Muncie?!
Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
...The people look like ants.
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
Now, Aim --
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
Tell me about it.
I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
...You don't?
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Yes sir...
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
Tell him I'll be right there...  Well, what is it?
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
How's that, Sid?
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
But, Mrs. Rand --
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
Thank you.  But who sits there? 
That doesn't sound like him.
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
No, Wes.
It is not beautiful.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
A mental case?
And charming?
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before.
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother.
To the asylum?
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
I wasn't star--
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
Dinner in ten minutes.
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
In the car.
That this was going to be a key party?
Grades?
Sure dad.
See you.
Ben--
Yeah?
Huh?
Dad stop it!
Fascist!
What you been up to?
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --
What the hell are you kids doing down here?
Talking to me, dad?
I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know --
-- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --
But...
But what?
Good shit.
Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?
Yeah. You?
I saw you on your bike today.
Who?
I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
I'm thinking of going back to school.
I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years.  When was the last time you rode a bike?
That's right.
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.
How can you do that man?
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
What do you mean?
You going to tell dad?
It's not packed with explosives, is it?
My what?
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
You have to follow me?
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
Are you his girlfriend?
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
We already did.
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
I don't remember.
No.
That's right.
He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks.
What do you want to talk about?
We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.
He's just rattling your cage.
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
One of your cases?
Did you love her?
I don't know.
Since grade school.
You want me to take you somewhere?
Hey...
That's what I said.
Who?
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
Yes.
Told you I could write an ending.
I told you that was an accident!
So you have the answers...
You mean we are not children of Satan?
It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
Louis, I swear I did not.
And yet you knew what I would o.
What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
Laudanum!
Don't Louis --
I want more.
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.
He's dead, Claudia, dead.
You know her?
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
She's no vampire.
I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
You really want to be with them?
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
And if I don't?
The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.
I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
We belong in hell.
The girl, Lestat -
My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...
Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
You're not lying to me, are you?
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
You said the slave had a crucifix...
Shall we go on?
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
I want off this island.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
He does work hard.
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
No.
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
I know I don't want to stay in here.
Julie?
I'm holding your hand!
No, you're not.
No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.
Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
Voodoo.
You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
Julie? What's wrong?
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
There was a body! I swear it!
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
To a great weekend --
Jeez, that's a full carat --
You guys lost?
Where'd Estes go?
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
Drunk again?
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
Did you hear what Thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.
I adore hearing Thea sing -- but my poor head's beginning to ache.  I'm so sorry.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -or just because he is one's father?
How do you know what my father thought - -
You were father's secretary - I never thought - -
What would I be thinking?
That your father and I 
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
What is her illness?
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl 
I know all you are going to say -I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -there is something about her the way she moves  the way she turns her head.
But the war, the army  they need you.
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
Listen to what I say --
Theodosia --
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen!  It's that fellow there  he says he's an angel  he's tried to hypnotize me.
Carter  bank examiner.
Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
No.
Clarence . . .
I . . .
Poor George . . . Sit down.
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
George Bailey.
You sent for me, sir?
Splendid! Is he sick?
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
Is this the place?
Looks like we'll have to send someone down  a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
What boat you sailing on?
What's that?
Oh, no  you don't feel so good.
Kind that will help you find the answers, George.
Oh, stop that grunting.
No.
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
Yes, you bet.
You want a martini?
I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about  build things . . . design new buildings  plan modern cities  all that stuff I was talking about.
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Oh, am I glad to see you.
Hello, George, how are you?
What's that?
Some other time, George.
Well, what do you know  wife.
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
Why didn't you call me?
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
Well, why don't you say it?
Have you made up your mind?
My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?
Would you rather leave?
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
Have fun.
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?
Is it snowing?
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
Come on, you guys.
When do we get to the lighthouse?
Sure you do -- you win either way.
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
Bring her to port a little.  That's it -- steady.
Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.
Your dad must be really pissed.
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
We got a helluva tide this month.
Chief?
What camera?
Mike's out there.
Where to?
Hey, come on....
You said something about a camera.
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....
Me neither.
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
What's that supposed to mean?
And sound.
Late.
Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
One what?  Ah-ha!
Nothing, huh?
Oh.  Want to talk about it?
I know what you're going to say.
Sean's asleep.
What's wrong?
What're you doing?
Are you serious?
I know, I know....
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
Yeah?  Then what?
Is that me?
That's you.
What's wrong?
Waiting for Andy.
Terry!  You okay?
Get a dance yet?
The wind drift is lateral.
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
It'll be fun, come on!
They're turning around.
Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
Wave to my son.
Oh, my God....
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
What's your plan, Brody?
Yeah.  Down there.
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
And leave me down here???
Here.
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
Sounds wonderful.
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
It's too soon to move him.
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
Michael, you're not going down there.
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
That's because I am the shark.
Hello.  I think his nap's over.
Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
Sure am.
How come?
Besides that.
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
Told you you'd like it.
I don't talk that way.
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!
What?
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
Oh...
Reach for the limit I always say.
What kind of trouble?
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
You'll spoil her.
I've always wanted to ride one of those....
No way....
Make a list.
What's wrong?  What happened?
Henny Youngman....
At least he doesn't have a beard....
We'll be there....
Sweet breezes...Sweet women....
I see what you're doing....
A big one....
Don't be late.
You can stay in my room.
I like Grandma's cooking....
I'll be in to read you a story.
I want you to get out of the water....
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
Oh, it looks like my uncle's.  He taught me how to sail when I was a kid....
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
You look tired....
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
Why'd you come out here?
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
How do you like flying?
No, you're not....
You're always taking time off....
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
I don't know what the hell to say....
Inch by inch....
I wish there was something I could do....
How many...?
If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
Maybe I missed you too....
A regular tropo...Spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit, living off nickel and dime grants.  You want to be a bum all your life, be my guest.  Not me.  I'm not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot....
It's not a bad life, Jake....
We don't write up anything until we're done....
How long?
Bring her to starboard.
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
I'm coming...How close is it?
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
You don't like my voice...?
I've got to get to her....
I'll do it, Jake.
It's my fault...I have to....
We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me....
Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....
When he has a pillow over his head....
That man keeps calling about his training film.  I can't convince him we don't have a S.W.A.T. team.
I'll take care of it.
As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?
The van?
Is it your vehicle?
Yeah, he can go ...
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
He thinks you stole his promotion.  What exactly you doin there, John?
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
What do you mean?
Pig Woman agreed to take a test.
Where is everyone?
No, you didn't.
We're going.
Why?
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
You got a quiet phone somewhere?
I guess by the bed.
Bits.
He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
Three or four.
Did he get you the job?
Bullshit.
I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
What are you reading?
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
Do you pray?
You're looking worried again, Helena?
The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..
He doesn't need my help.
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
When did John divorce?
Bobby's out .. What's the hurry?
Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
Reporters, Jerry.  They been callin' all night.
Hmm.  Pretty good.
Now what did you lose?
You think so?
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
It's all going to work.
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
I'm working with you because of that memo...
Well.
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
I'm relieved you said that.
Oh good.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
First you gotta tell me something.
I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
Oh, thank you.
Not right now, Jerry.
I'm sorry, I --
Mmm.  Hmm.
Good.  I was just testing ya.  But just you saying that? Makes me love ya.
Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --
Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?"
Great word.  Towel?
Forget it.  Forget it.
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME.
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed.
I'm a little worried --
You don't want to go home, do you?
I have to ask.
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.
Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
Marcee --
Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
Show me the animal, Jerry!
-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
I'm scared.  What is it?
Shut up!!!
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
No, it's...
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thats where he's headed.
Where's Dad?
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
I dont know.
Eric!
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
Did you read Malcolm's book?
Yeah.
I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
No. I couldn't see.
We're safe!
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
I have never been on this island!
Just a little bit too much, I think.
Minimal.
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
Are you all right?!  Anything broken?
Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
Okay.
What?
You version of it.
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
Our chance to do what?
What are they?
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
Why should they?
All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
Oh, God.
What?
These formations.  They're dried --
-- way we could safely --
You're sure we have to?
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
How long will this take?
Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
Once we have control again we - -
But you know, I should  really be the one going .
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -
- - and swallows fresh ones.
The fences are electrified, right?
Dr. Grant!
You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos.
I'm still not clear on Chaos.
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
Yeah.
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
I threw up.
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
You got me.
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!
You're sure?!
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
Tim!  Lex!
Dad - - Dad - -
They're just doing what they do.  Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
Watch how it eats!
Let's go!
C'mon Tim, move down, damn it!
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, that¹s all it is!
Don't do that!
That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
Well?
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.
Chain saws.
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
Okay... well... I think it's this way...
Mister Biller?
You have a map.
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
Other guy?
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
Quite a circus.
A house?
Are you going to plead insanity?
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.
Oh?
Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.
Uh-huh...
It's as though there were two people in that room... both of them asleep... both of them dreaming.
Add it to the list.
So Krueger thinks Jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
What is it really?
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
Yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake.
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
I usually take lunch by the River.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
No, sir.
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
I know.
Hello again.
Ah -- we're back to the "authorities" you spoke of.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
Gabriela ...?
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
Where you've been employed for seven years.
Can I ask -- how you found me?
Do you?
-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.
-- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
Oskar!
Am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.Ladies and gentlemen! I am touching the beast!
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
Father!
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
I want to thank you.
Jack!
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Barricade the gates! Quick!
Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?
What was it, Jack?
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!
I'm calling a wrap. We're heading back to the ship.
Compassion.
Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
Sorry. 
Yes indeed.
A few more days. We know who did this.
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
Well we're pretty --
Yes -- all right --
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
What about?
Will you let me ask you some questions?
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
-- OK --
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
No.
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
You and I -- a relationship.
How do you know how bad it was?
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. 
What?
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
Well --
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
I know Tom Grunemann.
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
Yes?
Where is the child?
In real life when does he hit you?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Greatest...
On earth.
I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?
When is mommy coming back?
Well, I see the Yankees finally won a game.
I'm sorry.
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
Now go to sleep.  It's very late.
Yes?
Is this really your desk?
Was there apple juice when you were little?
Daddy!  You're home early.  Did you get fired again?
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
A heavy drinker?
Yes.
How long was that?
What about Billy?
What?
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
Look at us, Joanna.  Just like any old married couple having dinner.  Who would believe it.
I'm sorry...I just mentioned it in passing.  I never thought he'd use it.
After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
What?
Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.
You ever see her talk to the walls?
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
I'm gonna keep him, why?
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
Again?
You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
I will buy them for you.
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.
Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
I am him.
In the Pacific Ocean.
Where is Alsace?
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
Can India help us?
We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
Please, come in, so cold.
You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.
I have more men.
This is Tibet. And this is China.
How could I ever leave?
Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.
It is a difficult situation.
Hmm.
Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
I'll sue you.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
<u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
We'd only just met.
At school they'd always say "go" first.
Where is he?
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
With crocodiles... everything's even.
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
So I don't like tents, why--
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
That was an awful thing to say to me.
He thinks they're what?
Good.  See ya soon.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
<u>Are</u> you okay?
Excuse me?
<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
Ssssh!
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
What?
He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
If you get a safe shot...
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
I'm fine, thank you.
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
Are you alright?
Are you okay?
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
The somebody else part?
Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, <u>you</u>... you're y'know...
A jerk.
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
Never cock. Just squeeze.
What'd I do?
No. He won't come after me.
Why not?
I will... I promise.
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Murdered...? How?
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
What do you see, Starling?
What would it take?
Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone.
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
Sewing...
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.
I think so.
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
No, I came because we need -
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
Then please - do this test for me.
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
Who killed your patient?
Big through the hips. Roomy.
No.
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
So you ran away...
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
Yes. I'll tell you.
Dr. Lecter -
Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin.
Are you alright?
Can we rest soon?
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
"We're a breed apart and we make no sense"...?
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
Because what I am interested in is right here...
Where will we go?
The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
Some say that's the way of it.
I see...
That is the truth!
I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
How long?
What did you say?
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?
And what is that?
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
Gold could be arranged.
What is enough?
We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?
Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
Such as...?
I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.
I'm not a doctor.
Not exactly a big ocean country.
We're on backup air.
I'm going inside.
Twenty minutes...
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
I'm going to try to remove it.
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
What is it?
What is it?
My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
Drachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They could do more harm than good.
Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it.
Because it's cheap like a budgie.
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.
Apart from those shotguns.
You fucking well have to get 'em!
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
Can I help?
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
Son?
What are you doing?
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
All right, Dad.
Yeah?
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
Is there no way they can get back to you?
There is only three of us here.
What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
I think I would rather just turn them over.
That's if I want to see you.
And?
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit.
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
That's going on optimism.
Twelve.
You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.
What do you mean?
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
I can't take any more school.
You think I can't learn that?
I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
I am, sir.
So you knew this young man before?
That the word on our boy?
Everybody on the border knows that story.
You got to investigate. No question about it.
What's that for?
It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
Best part of the job.
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
What?
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
I never met her.
So they stayed in Florida?
Same as they done in Mexico.
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
Didn't have a father?
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
So I'm part-Indian?
Big O was always there with a  smile or a loan or a free drink.
I have a B average.
Something like that.
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
Pleased to meet you.
I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.
That where he was shot?
That's where he fell.
Right.
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
Is very beautiful, your car.
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
You have somebody else out there?
No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--]
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
Tell that one, Hollis--
We don't need a new jail.
That's a matter of interpretation--
When we backed you--
You go by your old house?
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
And Buddy was one of them.
You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
Fellas.
Hey, Sam.
And the ten thousand?
The Perdido thing?
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
He had the club out on the old trail road--
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
Not if I can help it.
Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.
That was the night he disappeared?
Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
You got in late last night.
Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
How much you got left?
It was for personal consumption.
Got him here?
Your mother still doesn't like me.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
Most people did, yeah.
We thought we were something, didn't we?
Yeah.
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
We start from scratch--
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Yeah.
I been working on a few things.
No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
Yeah.
I didn't want to be going around your back.
You're the one who's a good boy. Man say "fetch" and you fetch--
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--
You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun up--
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.
For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
Been away. Up to Houston.
He's gonna find out.
Mister D'Amour?
I could have lost my fucking hands.
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Who did this?
We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
Yes.
What's the connection?
He's a secretive man.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
I can be very persuasive.
They were jealous of him.
Why?  Because he had you?
No.
Is it finished?
I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
--vanished.
Oh, I've got plenty.
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
I saw him in Vegas once.
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
What for?
I can't let you in.
I want to see Swann face to face.
My God.
Hold on.
I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
You know Vinovich?
Sure.  Vivovich.
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
For what?
He deserved it.
Didn't know you read minds.
No.
They got here before us.
Nobody's better off this wav!
That's where we're all going.
He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
Fuck you.
Swann?  What are you doing?
Yeah, they told me.
Hello?
25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
What did you study?
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
You're possessive.
Oh.
It's for my daughter.
Four.
We should get you to the doctor.
Where's your husband?
I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
Charlotte?
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Mr. Harris?
Mr. Harris?
Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?
That's ok.
Do you want I send it to your room?
Excuse me?
How'd it go today?
Are you sure you want to stay?
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.
Bad?
Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
There you are!  My God, darling, I've been so worried.  Are you alright?
I don't know.  What are they?
...you wearing a watch, Father?
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
My secretary?
No, I wasn't, actually.
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
Something he said, just before...
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.
Oh my God!
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
I'll bet.
I had to.
And the point is?
Trick him.
So what?
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
And what are you thinking we should do now?
Look, John, I'm facing it.
I plan to.  You want a tip?
As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.
What happened?
What?
So what do I do?
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
That's not it.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
You could make a career by telling me where.
I don't wanna see that.
Why not?
No.
I know...
And he's fine, girl.
You ever been in love?
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
I was just playing ball.
Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
Man, forget you then, stupid.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
With a jacked-up attitude.
Yeah.
You don't look half-bad.
Hey.
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
What are we playing for?
What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
What's up?
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
Oh yeah?
What do you mean?
It just isn't.
Why do you keep asking me that?
Something was just missing.
you woke me up to tell me that?
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
So?
What's that, not great?
You hearing me?
You scared me.
Guess I should have been telling your father.
I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
What are you doing here?
I ain't a damn liar.
From your mouth.
And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?
You fuckin' don't do that. You don't do it, you cocksucker. I'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands.  Go. get the fuck fuck -- we're going back and we finish the show --
What's wrong?
Well can you connect me to someone else?
It's a helluva disease.
Wanna call me a slut now, something?
Don't sit down.
Yes.
Did you hear what I said?
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
You don't have a boyfriend?
Who was it?
What are you lookin' for?
Is this boyfriend bothering you?
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
Ok, ok. I'm back.
Bye, bye, Claudia.
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
You really use strong language.
Yeah.
I lost my gun.
What?
Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
You don't know how crazy I am.
-- you the resident here?
No, what's wrong?
Diet Coke.
-- what kind?
I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine.
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
How much you pay me for my help?
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
Tell me what you know, I'll tell you what I know --
I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.
Check that ego - come off it - I'm the profit - the proffesor Ima teach you 'bout The Worm, who eventually turned to catch wreck with the neck of a long time oppressor And he's runnin from the devil, but the debt is always gaining And if he's worth being hurt, he's worth bringin' pain in - When the sunshine don't work, the Good Lord bring the rain in.
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
What happend?
Is it real love?
Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
Gently, son --
Braces?
Do you wanna sit down?
I don't know...I mean, he's around, he's here, in town, y'know, but I don't know...he's a tough one...very.... Do you have a girlfriend, Phil?
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
...cocksucker....
...I can't hold onto this anymore...
Who are you gonna call?
Graduation?
Is this 509-9027?
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
This isn't meant --
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
Go ahead and waste your time.
Yeah.
And what did your parents do?
"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
I'm sorry.
And "Frank?"
"Frank" was my mother's father.
Is Linda here?
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
Uh. huh.
It's interesting.
I don't think, he can't...
No one else in here?
I preffer to stand.
You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?
I went out last night.
Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?
This is the LAPD. If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --
All your other fluzzies?
Come and tell me it's over and I'll walk away, Jimmy.  I've fucked you behind your wife's back for three years, and you've fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time -- I'll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience, but don't put me in the middle --
What happend to you?
Slowly or quickly?
-- did she talk to you?
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
Rose, I don't --
How long with Ellen?
It's over.  I talked to her this morning.
Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
I think that you know.
Jimmy, did you touch her?
Do you still have to do homework?
We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
Linda, you're safe.  Ok. It's alright. You're my friend.  You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say --
Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand?  y'know?  I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
What would you like?
We need more dog food --
You have to be nicer to me, Dad.
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
Louis, please -- !
Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?
What is that?
Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
How is he?
What you're asking is impossible!
Bloody hell...
Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
Forgiveness.
Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like...
I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
What use am I?
What do we do now?
D'Artagnan, unready?
You are right.  But it is a trap.
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.
It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
It's been too long.
Thanks, but not for me.
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.
Who came?
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
... You knew you had a double?
You are beautiful.  You know you are.
Shall I leave?
It's Marvosa -
What do you think?
Bullshit...
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
Did you start out area six?
It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.
And what did he do to the girl?
You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
And where the hell is Marvosa?
Where is he?!!
Yeah?
Where up north?
And what did you do?
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
I killed them.
How about Marvosa and the others?
So...what happened to you, Jimmy?  I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the good old days.
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
That was her - the girl... We have to go.
I'm not going anywhere!
You must be going somewhere.
Did you have sex with her?
Long gone, huh?
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
Not the Bible?
Read it.
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
Last two like this we had, you caught.
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
Get me a plane!
Asian studies at Langley said the mark you found on the tree is a Chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling. The character also appears on a mah- jongg piece.  It means Red Dragon.  That mean anything to you?
'Changes?'
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
Who is it?
Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
I don't know...
Do you see?
God, no.
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
I don't understand.
That's true.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
If I were?
Hello, hotshot!
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.
Blue is cold.
...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you.
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
No.
I have to go back to Birmingham.
Come home with me.
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
We don't know that.
Did the girl die?
Why should I tell you?
You had disadvantages.
Pictures?
Glaser Safety Slugs?
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
Andy!
Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
So how can I help you...?
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
So who's gonna pay for it?
Hi... am I late?
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
You're a wimp.
What?!?
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"
What is this, World War Two...?
It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
I, I was asked to do this material - -
Goals are important.
This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy much to do.
It's my name.
Then the informant is real.
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
Lieutenant?
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
What?!
You don't, do you?
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
No, it's all right.
Goddamnit!
All right --
I got a fibrillation!
When?
Right now, we're inside a computer program?
How did I beat you?
Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable.  But now I believe that is going to change.
What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
And you still believe I'm the One?
No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
How is he?
We need an exit.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.
Is it?
Did you go to her?
Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
Is Morpheus alive?
That I would have to make a choice...
I have to.
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
What are they doing to him?
How much time?
Neo, this has to be done!
An Agent!  You have to send me back!
They've burned through the outer shields.
You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
So?
Nervous?
Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
You got some mouth!
Nah.
There won't be any this week.
Hey...you got nothing here.
Don't you move!!!
Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...
No.
What pipes?
You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
$3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?
Diane, how are you feeling?
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
Uncle, how are you feeling?
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
Sure...He lives there?
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
The girls like it loud.
Scumbag--
Daddy!
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
I know you do, darling.
Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
What about the Mayor?
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now?  Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed?  And I don't mean you and me.  I mean you and him.
It doesn't matter.
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
What'd it say?
'Yes' to the deal?
I was saying to Quince we won't need --
Sounds good.
I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --
The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.
None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
Yes.
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
No.  Nothing.
Good morning, Jennifer.
Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
Yes --?
I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
Has her pain abated?
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
I'm sorry about --
And is your heart beating strangely?
Where are you going?
I love you in an evening gown.
What will we do?
'Love will find out the way'?
I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him.
I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
Well, thank you for letting me know.
Sounds fair enough.
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
I want to live.
Excellent.  What is it?
I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
I don't know.
I'm not hungry.
I couldn't sleep.
Yeah.
I think you heard me, Bill.
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
I told you to shut up.
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
Happy Birthday, Bill.
'...I know, it's none of my business.'
What question?
The 'question' --
I'm doing great.  You ready?
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
I don't like to interfere.
I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
Thank God.
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
Where's Joe?
I don't know, I can't say --
Daddy --
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
How'd you know?
I've got patients coming in --
...It's kind of a pro bono job.
...We know so little about each other.
21.
You read it off your fucking photo. You don't know me, you don't even know who you are.
Well, what then?
What can I do for you, Leonard?
Seen you together, that's all.
Why?
Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.
That's right I did, didn't I?
A cop?
Who did this to you?
I like your car.
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
Why?
Strip!
Take the money and walk away!
Tell me about her again.
Deals?
It's isolated.
Such as?
My wife used to call me Lenny.
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
They're not looking for him.
How do you know about me?
I can't make new memories. Everything			  * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before.
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
Lenny, is that you?
John Gammell?
You really want to find this guy?
You're living.
Natalie? Natalie who?
Shut it, Teddy.
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
So what are you gonna do now?
Prove it.
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
Envelopes?							    *
You're not coming?
What's wrong?
My wife wasn't diabetic.
Why would I do that?						    *
To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many		    * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
What cop?
Bullshit.							*
* Thank you.							    *
About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them.
Yes you do...
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
How many?
The Keys?
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
Like...?
Is it December?
Where would I go?
If they attack you...
What's our deal?
What is it?
Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So...
People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo!  That some crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"
Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network.
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
What's your take?
If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...
Then you should.
Hello?
Detective Crockett.
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
How?
From whom...?
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
Never heard of him.
What are you talking about?
So?
You mean with the flowers...?
Okay.
It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. José knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.
Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
Must be some mess back there.
I ain't sleepy.
You gonna beat me, Joe?
That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here.
Joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am I wrong? You know, in my own place my name ain't Ratso. I mean it so happens my name is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.
The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.
Where'd that come from?
You're what?
What you got me up here for?
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
I'm going to Florida.
I'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a drunk. I'm lonesome so I'm a dope fiend. I'm lonesome so I'm a thief, a fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop, I say, poop! I've heard it all and I'm sick of it, sick to death.
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is he all right?
Getchmis...?
What?
And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
For the money... )
Not far. Just a little way.
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Stupid.
Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
Where is it?
We go back.
Why the suit?
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash.
Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
Is there a switch?
What are you doing down here?
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
The lights come up, you pull the switch.
You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
Thought it was my week for that.
Maybe they lied to you.
Susan, listen to me:  you handled that insect almost as much as Siri...
It didn't bite me.
It's me. Can you hear me?
Don't.
It worked before...
Oh, come on, come on!
You sure you didn't see one of these?
What is it?
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
Here.
When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing.
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
What's your new book called?
I can take it, go ahead.
The profanity bothers you?
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 75.
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
Then light the match, Paul.
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
You--fooler...!  Did I do good?
Annie, what's the matter?
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.
...have to wait.
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
Why would you lose me?
Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
It's good you found it.
Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
Buster.
An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.
One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?
I suppose I did.
Then don't say it.
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
Nyah!
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
I knew where it was.
What was the top bid?
-- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are..
Ninety-three point four million.
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.
Package away in five..four..three.. two..one...
Do you know me?
What if I pay the rent?
Uh-huh.
What are you doing here?
Would you mind if I'm on top?
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
They've got a book for this?
What's the population of Seville any idea?
I'd like a little more conviction..
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
And that's the only reason?
Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
Just like old times.
Have you met them?
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
Why did you phrase it like that?
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
And then what?
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
You mean it'll be difficult.
Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
..not in time to save him.
Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
That simple, huh?
Left jacket pocket?
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
Now how to get in there.
You have Bellerophon.
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
Come on!
The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface.
All ten million.
Did we get it?
I'm walking.
Talking's good, walking's better.
Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes.
No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
The message is for Job.
Ethanís right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
Donít <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
Yes.  I see your point.
Why was there another team?
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
This whole operation was a molehunt.
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
What are we downloading?
What kind?
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
Bank?
That's not it.  That's not the list.
Ethan.  Heís out of pocket.
Would you remove your hat please?
When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
Why not?
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
- and picked us up in the States -
Whatís going to make him do that?
Arenít you going to thank me Jim.  Ten million is better than six.
Jim, itís over.
Try it again.
Itís working.
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
Rita. Pass the wine.
Okay.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Rose, pass the wine.
The guy died.
In a month.
I won't come.
It's temporary.
What'd you do to your hair?
The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.
It's wrong to just let them go.
I'm going to marry him.
I'm making you a steak.
Where'd Johnny find you?
When you get engaged?
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
Stupid yourself.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
What are you doing!
To the bed.
I was dead.
I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
What?
I can't!
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
What?
What are you talking about?
Hi.
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
I know what I know.
I was.
No.
What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
It's Johnny Cammareri.
No?
Maybe you're right.
What's the matter?
Have Something.
Will you marry me?
What do you mean?
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
How was your plane ride?
Have you told her we're getting married?
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
Why not?
Cosmo's cheating on me.
No more he's not.
Do you love him, Loretta?
Oh.
That's a pretty big sin.
Lucy. There are big things going on in my house. My granddaughter Loretta, the only daughter of my son Cosmo, has engaged herself to be married a second time.
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
I will. But I must find the right moment.
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
Johnny...
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
I'm sure she did.
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?
That woman was a student of yours?
May I walk with you a ways?
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
You mean the whole house?
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
Halt!  Who goes there?
Yes!
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
Oh!
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
None shall pass.
Come on then.
You'll what ... ?
Come Here.
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
There.
... You silly sod.
Man!
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed!
Bloody peasant! 
Well?
What is your quest?
To find the Holy Grail.
What is your favorite colour?
I can't.
I dunno, Must be a king.
Well taken, Concorde!
Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
No ... just keep him in here.
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
Well ...
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
No.  It's unhealthy.
You've come to rescue me?
He's come to rescue me, father.
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
Seventy a year.
One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges.  It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it?  Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.
I'm getting dressed.
She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you.
I can't move to tidy.
It's what the maids are for.
Checked and locked, sir.
I'm flattered you think so.
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
Mother....
Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
And that is my last word on the matter.
Checked and locked, sir.
How will I know what she requires?
Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting.
I'm fine.
The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
I am.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
Those, over there, there.
Are they worth reading?
Who by?
Yes?
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
Have I ever let you down before--?
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance.  As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen.  You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens.
So?
What's her excuse this time?
Yes.
Where did you find it by the way?
I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.
It's Mr Brown, ma'am.
Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
Where is my son?
Then why are you not with him?
Does that thing work?
If I tell you, then it's no fun.
But how can it change every time?
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
How'd you know it was us?
Now what seems to be the problem?
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
What's her problem?
I came from the city on the left.
It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
It's already out.
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
What?
You mean we learn the rules...
Alex...
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
Okay.  Give us a kiss?
What the fuck is that?!
What is it?
Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.
That's impossible.
Can you say anything but "cool"?
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
And?
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
There is no problem.
Sure.
One.
I understand.
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
Can you tell me what happened?
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
What is it Rita?
Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.
No.... I don't...
There's nothing?
It's not my voice ... but I know her.
"What about you? What will your dad think about you?"
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
What is it? What do you see?!
And who are we auditioning for today?
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
It's kind of embarrassing but,
You see what I mean...
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
Yeah, they showed me
Nice wallets.
Making ends meet, huh.
So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
You must come in first place to move on !
Where are we ?
Leave him, he's dead.
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.
Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me.
Do you have something better to talk about ?
How can you just take a life ? I mean it's a life, life is so precious.  How does it feel ?
I wanted to let his family know....
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
You okay ?
What are you DOING here ?
Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?
That's nice.  I think I lost my wallet.
I thought you made this place ?
Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?
And how much do we pay you annually ?
Yes sir.
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
I was.
How long till the drug wears off ?
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.
Maybe you should get over fears.
Look ! Look !
Yes.
Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
No sir. I was just getting , well you know. Water. We weren't talking about sex or anything else except Star Wars. Just saying hello. I think I'm gonna go now.
Why don't you shut up now.
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
What??
No nuns, got it.
Thanks, I needed that.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
I love you too sweetie, bye.
Can I see him?
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
It's okay really, I was just a baby.
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
I told you it was a long story.
Special effects?
Do you have any pictures if her?
Well...
Then what did she do?
What can I do for you?
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
He's writing. Hello?
I want juice!
Thanks....
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.
Vada.
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.
That thing you said about your nose...it was a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I mean...it's yours...you know?
Some sacrifices are worth it.
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
No?
And you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve.
She lives here too?
But...are you engaged or something?
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
Lock the door.
Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...
No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
Oh...what's that?
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
Well you've gotta be prepared.
Why not now?
What do you mean?
But Dad'll never go for it.
Shelly?
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
You are perfectly healthy.
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
What Hurts Vada?
It's still available I hope?
Deceased.
Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
It's nice.
You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.
Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...
Did you ahh, love him?
Watch you don't knock out a fish.
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
Are they ready yet?
Why not?
In the garage.
Nothing, I'm dressing.
Are you sure about all this?
Will you tell her I came by?
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
Oh, Vada...
Who's that?
No.
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
Do you like her?
Yes it is.
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
Hi.
Uh huh.
No.
Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?
Well he just left, what's wrong?
My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer.
You could pick that scab on your arm.
Your lip bleeding?
Hey look at this!
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
No, I don't wanna.
Is that your Dad?
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
Heaven.
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
Can we go yet?
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
Jump in the water!!
But I have my clothes on!
Why are you running away?
Like they do on TV?
No.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
Would you think of me?
I honestly wish I could...
I've lost interest.
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
Excuse me?
I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.
About Michael's job.
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?  As M. of H., you get first fuck.  Don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.
I saw the show.
If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
Where was that, Florence, huh?
Takes me back.
It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
Oh, yeah.
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
It's not just a gag, huh?
Maybe it's happy there.
You got a real good memory, Star.
What do you have to buy?
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
Is there food?
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
She's going to rest now.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
He knows better.
How is that?
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
He has that sign with the tree.
It's on National television, Barnett.
Well, how about the shopping center?
It's an appearance. It has nothing to do with support. I don't even like him.
He's my father.
How in the world did he get shot?
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Didn't you get?... How are you?
I'm fine. Can I go up?
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
Uh huh.
It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
Replacement party.
How do you know?
Mom?
Well, I got to Nashville. That's pretty far.
Next you'll be sick.
I don't think so.
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
Yes, it is --
Well, can you tell me why?
How long have you been with them?
Hello.
Yes. Who's this?
Who is this?
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
Who is this, right?  I called you last night.
When did you think it would happen?
Oh.
That's unkind.
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
That's for sure. At the airport - that's where it was. At the airport, there in one of those gift shops... Anyway, you better take a break.
Hello. John Triplette.
Oh, no.
For him?
What for?
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Hi.
Where are you from?
Ah... Peter Finch.
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
You sure do it loud.
I see.
That's what Tim said.
That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
Mickey!
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
How come you never talk?
Not good.
You ready, Donut?
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
Then was it worth it?
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
Just wait one fucking minute.
No. Not really.
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
They've hypnotized the nation.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
That's my opinion.
Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox.
And where do you keep Mickey?
What the hell happened to you?
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
Waitin' in the lounge.
When do you want the assembly?
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
Lose 'em.
Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---
We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
So we got a deal. Four deputies---
Don't call my men assholes.
Could we go with you and film it?
You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.
Want to talk to you.
Yeah.
Okay.
'That right? I thought he was up North.
Guess I don't.
Where was your father born?
Like hell. You know, if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you, they might not try it.
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
Yeah, I been there.
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
Oh yeah?
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
Your boy.
I'll have some coffee, please.
What d'you mean?
Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
He could live with us.
What about them?
You didn't answer my question.
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
Uh-huh. Why?
My kids want me to teach them.
I keep thinking about him.
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
Hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no-how.
What d'you mean?
Ain't you goin' to say something?
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.
What you gettin' all pretty for?
What's so hot 'round town?
Good-bye, Frankie.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
No.
That's right.
No, thanks.
Well, what're you going to do?
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
Hi.
I ain't drunk, honey.
What's the matter now?
Let's go.
I fucking hate Raoul.  Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
You hate Raoul?
I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
How long's it been?
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
Alright. Let's talk business.
What does this have to do with me?
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
Did you trace it?
What are you talking about?
You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
Are you even really alive?
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
Right...
You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
Who got you into this?
Doesn't look like much, but that's King Hell ice, man. Fry your brain out soon as look at you.
I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
You can make your move when it comes after me.
What are you talkin' about?
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
Wait... You hear that?
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
You've been calling her name.
How soon is soon enough?
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
Something exotic I hope.
Is he going to make it?
We've still got to find the mainframe.
Shit...
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
How are you at riddles, Peter?
Thanks.
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
What?
YOU DID.
You're Pam?
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Anita, remember espadrilles?
Now this is cute.
Bridgework?
Cuuuute!
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
Hi!
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
You've done five of my ideas.
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Have you been there?
This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!
He's my teacher!
You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
You having fun?
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
So what are you thinking for college?
Okay This is okay. Smooth.  Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
Why?
You ruined the whole thing!
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
I know.
I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.
But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
No.
Then we'll both starve...  An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...
He's conducting experiments of his own.
That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.
Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal?  Listen - all old houses have stories.
I wasn't sure, Ken...
Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
You remember your dreams, Grady?
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
What?
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love."
No. Never.  You think that's what it is?
Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
What do you mean?
Jesse, God - what happened?
Huh?
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
There's a Jesse on the phone.
You're going out?
I'm serious.
Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
He's full of shit.
Can't it wait till morning?
Watching TV.
Do you still...see each other?
I used to live in this house.
They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
So?
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
Call me Nancy.
You're late.
Never been here before?
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
With Hypnocyl?
Try me.
You sound like Peter Pan.
We can try again.
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
My God.
How is he?
I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
Uh, fourteen.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
No.
If that's all right.
Okay.
Yes, you did.
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
Yup.
Well, get a message through to him too.
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
You like Chagall?
You have a stunt bottom?
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
How are you doing?
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
That's spectacularly unfair.
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
Thank you.  Shall I...
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
That's right -- Topol.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
So it could have been neither of them?
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Martin -- your customer.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
Definitely no comment.
Buggered?
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
No, don't think I do.
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Spike.
Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
Excuse me.
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Yes, ma'am...
Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
A vote is before the group.
You men remain seated!
Thank you, ma'am.
Whatcha boys playin'?
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
So long, kid.
W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never c-c-coming back!
Whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin' you...?
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
Yeah, Mack?
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
It's the questions she asks.
Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
Christ, they even got my first grade report card here...
It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party.
Lobotomy?
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
What for?
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
I don't trust you!
Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.
Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... Okay, who wants a card?
Shhh. Wait a minute. You guys are gonna screw up my plans. So just gone on back to bed like nothin' happened.
Gimme the ball!
Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
That's correct, Doc ...
I'm afraid not.
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
Pardon me miss, but would you mind turning...
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
Yeah, buddy?
You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!
Somebody's coming!
Got a cigarette?
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
What kind of crap is that???
Why, sure, ma'am...
He's dead.
That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.
No, she wasn't my sister.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
Excuse me?
So, what's the story with your friend?
--separate, in the evening..."
What?
Dwayne?
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
It's an amazing place, don't you think?
Hello?  Is anybody there?
If it's any of your business, yes.
I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So, I called there, they said he left yesterday.  But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in.
What?
Yeah.  Well, was the least I could do.
I know the feeling.
You aren't?
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
Any night.
Well, not exactly...
Yes?
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Oh, hello.
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
I don't know, Kate.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
I have vacation time coming to me.
Does Dwayne know about this?
Thank you so much.
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
What'd you find?
Her brother.
All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.  God, I hate blind dates.  Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
Hi.  Where've you been?
Peter found him?
Yup.
Uh huh.
You miss me?...
Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
I have to talk to her.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
Maybe he gave them an argument.
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
Boss loader!
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against 
I know. I know.
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped
A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
How would you've done it?
Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood.
That was nice of you.
The things that go on.
How do you like that one?
I don't know.
Wham... .
It's quite  nice.
Were you really a prize fighter?
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt What more do you want?
What I did to Joey.
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you   Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
What do you want from me, Father.
You go to hell.
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
You can!
You all right, Nolan?
Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had other ideas.
I'm just resting my feet.
You was a Golden Warrior.
Not a dent.  Perfect
Do you?
The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
I am--It's our only chance.
She is to be <b>mine!</b>  It is so spoken!
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
Is there time?
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
Aannnnaahhnn.
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Oh.  Uh-huh.
Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak.
Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
There.  You see the guy sitting on the porch?  The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.
They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
You're gonna use a ram?
Put it down or I'll shoot.
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
Who was the friend?
I bet.  How much?
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
You know how to use one a these?
Where's your gun, your pistol?
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
Nothing.
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
What, as a sales rep?
It smelled.
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
In the trunk?
Whose blood you got all over you?
I thought you guys were busted.
How many?
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
You goin' right back to work?
How are you, Richard?
For a time.
Like what?
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
Thing I'm worried about is you.
Right now, son.
Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.
You're a fighter?
Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
What do you want?
It's beautiful.
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
He's still married though, huh?
Then they're not separated, are they?
Was it Foley?
Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
Out for the evening?
You here all by yourself?
In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?
The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes.
What?
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
Faux goose down.
Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
Foley's got it.
I think he must've fell in.
I wish she could forget him.
You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
Yes Sir.
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
It's tight.
Land of the free.
Fun today.  Like old times.
We've always tried to beat each other.
You were more like brothers.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.
There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
Is that the good new, Sir, or --
Well sure, Colonel --
Our doctor's gone too.
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
You take care, Dorie.
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
Have the planes made it to China?
There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.
You should have left here years ago, like I did.
Peggy Sue!
And we're here on the couch...
Charlie...
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
Charlie! Am I dead?
How do you feel?
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Great, isn't it?
He's trying.
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
But what has to be different?
What're you doing here?
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
What would that be, sir?
Did you study for the test?
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
Are you for real?
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
Don't get your hopes up.
How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
Coffee and a donut.
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more JellO for me, Mom.'
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
Quiet today?
Mom!
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
Maddy's party.
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
Why not? They're my favorite.
What's up?
Dancing with you.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
I	know what a burrito is.
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
How, did you know about my grandfather?
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack.
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
What are you talking about?
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
I came to say goodbye.
So are you. You've got a vision.
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
Who was that?
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
I've never had anyone die before...  ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually...
I gotta go back and do my chores...
How did it go with your father last night?
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
I know, Mom.
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.
It could be parasites, an infection...
Hold still. Shit.  The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter.
Whatever.
I know that, Charles.
Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust. My client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! Other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage!
New baby?
Congratulations.
Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
What's her name?
Rayisha.
I'm a law suit.
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
Particularly, Charles.
I'm an excellent lawyer.
What do you love about it?
Yes.
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he was working so hard... Still, I felt something was wrong.  And I can't believe <u>they're</u> saying they didn't notice anything.
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
Objection!
Andrew Beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?
But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
That's correct.
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
Probably since she was born.
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Going on... like...?
<u>She</u> didn't try to conceal it.
So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
Let's continue.
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did <u>any</u> of them know Andy was sick? <u>How</u> did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street?
Why, what'd you hear?
What do you see? Riddick?
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
Like the light is scalding it.
Let's move.  Just a detour. He'll get us there.
Amazing. I'm Johns.
What?
No, no, I wanted to get away.
<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
How many?
Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind, I pray you go insane.
Hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
We cannot go through there....
Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --
Owens!
I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.
We crossed our own tracks.
What the hell are these?
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
Well, you got the big gauge.
<u>Fuck me</u>. You said "clear."
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
An' this?
Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
Now, just a minute --
Yo!
Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
What signal?
Gone.
long pause) You know it.
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
Scarecrows?
We got off at the wrong stop.
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?
I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
What about me?
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
Of course.
How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
But the proof? The doll?
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
Whaddaya talking shit for man. Hey Junior! Y'ever smoke any shit?
Where's he from?
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
Then what do you suggest big shot?
Yeah. How 'bout you?
First time?
And you, do you believe?
No, thanks...
...you know that night we got hit... I... 
Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes...
'People say I'm the life of the party cause I tell a joke or two although I may be laughing loud and hardy deep inside I'm blue...'
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
Right...
Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
I'll make one for you.  I live there.
Indefinitely?
Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away.
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
Immigration Officer?
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
And do you amuse the guests?
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.
Do you think I don't?
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
So have I.
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
See anything?
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
Would I want to?
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
Me?
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
Yes.
We try to be decent.
You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?
This isn't a very good place to talk.
What does he see?
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
Time's up.  I'm off the case. 
To do what?
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
But even if you were in love with me.
Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.
No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
Name it.
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
What are your rates?
All right, let's see the buzzer.
What's a buzzer?
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
Could be.
A couple of hours.
The only answer I have for you.
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
I had a father who knew how to steal.
That's not enough.
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
Would you?
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?
So?
No suicide.
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
No.
"Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete.  We advise identification possible.  Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?
I believe you won decorations during the war.
There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
You ought to know why.
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
You already have the checks, darling.
Of course.
Be nasty.
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
It's kind of you to see me.
Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Thank you.
Hello.  Anyone for a walk?  Tom isn't, I can tell you.
Shall we go?
Give them here.  This tells you how the Women's Peace Camp came to be set up.  All local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country.
I'm not sure I can face it.
Committed to memory.  Forever.
No.  I'd want to--
Yes, please.
So it's all worked out perfectly...
And I didn't like that man.
No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
Both dead.
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
We don't seem to get much time to talk.
And the Argies.
Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
That's enough of that.
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
Perhaps I will, then.
It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. .
It's that lady from Norfolk again.
Dad.
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.
Darling Susan.  You look like an angel.  But where's your hat?
It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
I can't do this.
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
I'm not FBI anymore.
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
The hell are they?!
I need you to teach me.
This gonna take long?
Who's the girl?
People are expendable to Bodhi.
Meaning you were expendable.
Look at you.
Ouch.
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
Mean anything to you?
What story did you give to Davis?
This isn't your style, Dillon.
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
Hawkins?
What in God's name...?
Where the hell is his body?
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
Your uncle will like this.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
You looking' for some company?
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
It pays.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Off the boulevard.
Diet coke.
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
Uh-huh.
Try a strawberry.
Why?
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
No?  Why's that?
What?
It'd cost you.
All right, two thousand.
Never answer the phone.  Ever.
This isn't a date.
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
Television?
Why not?
Okay.
Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
I think it's exciting.
What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
Where are you taking me!?
What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
My what?
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
Oh, god, what?
Edward, did you hear me?
I'm here.
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
Yes...
Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
I don't think there's any sense in --
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
Kit!  Where've you been?
I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
It was great.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
You're a guest here?
What's your name?
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
Hi, Barney!
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
Every ship but the four you sent.
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
With pride. What can I do for you?
Singed a bit, were you?
Probably he means no harm.
FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?
But you don't know where he is.
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
Yes.
Westley's only faking, right?
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
Who won? How did it end?
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
-- yes --
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
Hah?
How old were you?
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
"To my honey I'll croon,
What is that?  A handkerchief?
I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
Assume away!
What do you mean?
Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.
What???
I'm not going to jump on you!
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
What is she gonna do here?
Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
I vas never a member of the Nazi party.  I am not responsible.  I only followed orders.  Who are you?
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
But he has long hair!
Not.
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
Here.  You see.  This is the slow fuse.  It is much wider.  It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.
Do it!  Do it!
You, Blum go Motel.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
I solemnly swear...
By the sacred memory...
Of Siegfried...
Wagner...
The Graf Spee...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Heil you know who!
People can hear you.
I mean in show business.
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
No. At least I don't recall.
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
No one met her?
How did she pay you?
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
What's your interest?
Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then...
Must've needed it.
Five hundred.
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
With the forty thousand dollars?
I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.  I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
Please!
Yes.
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
She haven't even called you?
It's been three.
Yes.
He didn't come back here?
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
Watch your tenses.
We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
Hospital clean.
That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
You can't go up there.
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
We could laze around here a while longer.
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
I have to go, Sam.
I haven't even been married once yet!
And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.
You have a vacancy?
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
You go out... with friends?
Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
Why do you ask that?
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
Frankly, yes.
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
Wait a minute!
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
Maybe you saw Mary!
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...
I'll take you to...
Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
No mother.
Just before she died she came to--
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
No, I don't want money. I only want to find out who you are and where you live. My business is finding peo- ple. Not taking their money.
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
You here again?
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
What's that?
You're losing your blood?
There's no child here.
You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
What are you laughing at?
I don't agree with you.
He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
I won't let you say that!
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
But I think these things are beautiful.
Oh! Mr. Igor! -- I'm so glad you're here -- I don't know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid.
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
We'll grant that.
I used to be married to one.
You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
What do you mean police dog?
He might get some publicity out of it.
That's what I said.
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.
Why?
Is that a fact?
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
To lunch.
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.
Two: what if I didn't miss?
Why am I doing this?
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
Where is she?
I am in awe of it, Mother.
Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
What is it, Rose?
What'd you do, Rose?
You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
Here comes Daddy.
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
Five hundred rabbits?
You were up late last night, Brother.
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
Well... maybe...
The new girl is here.
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
What did you say, Brother?
What'd you say, Brother?
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
Heh, what a hypocrite.
She's watching the car again?
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.
A baby... and she isn't even married.
That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
Are they polar bears, too?
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
Please do.
Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
Is she all right?
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?
She already told you, she doesn't know.
It's twenty after one.
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
You're so sweet.
Oh, anywhere downtown.
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
Well, it's Billy.
Mine.
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
Tell me about that job in Alexandria, Dave, the big motel you're building.
She didn't marry him, though, later she married another guy and went to Winston-Salem. It didn't last That girl couldn't have no lastin' marriage, she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west. Little bitch left him, too, and you know what she's married to right now?  A kike. That's right, some kind of kike horse doctor named Schapiro out in Seattle, who's got the nerve to have the same first name I got. Wouldn't you know it, Rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike? She was always out of her friggin' head and I'll tell you why.  Buddy, she was sick in her mind and between her legs, too. She was a nymphomaniac.
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
What's the matter with him?
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
How much?
What... ?
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
What'd I say?
Jiminy Christmas.
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
All I got is being a cop.  What do I do if I'm not that?
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
Yeah.
Dean Martin.
Where we going?
You don't smoke.
Wha... ?
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.
Let's go!  Fuck everything!  God damn sons of bitching mother humpers... I'm gonna rip'em all brand new assholes... !
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
He tried to kill us.
There'll be other chances.
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
Why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap?  Some fruitcake's writing it between bong hits, making it up as he goes, and you're actually taking the time to read it.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
Slow down.
I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
You get him?
Just got here.
Come again... ?
You John-Wilkes-Booth-ed him.
The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Shall we try and go around?
He wasn't. I can feel it.
Lower it!
Good luck.
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
Quiet.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
He's my father.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
He might be.  I don't know.
Yes.
It's just a..a party Janet.
Well I want to leave.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
Right!
A decision had to be made.
Promise you won't tell Brad.
On the day I went away.
Now I
No no no, no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Who's Eddie?
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
I think it's closed.
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
I wanna let my brother know where I am.
It's not that --
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
Sharp -- Real nice.
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
I thought it might be cute.
Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
...What?
...I can't beat him.
...Like you?
What?!
I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
My side.
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
Did ya get the license number?
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
...That's an old one.
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
This a con?
What's ya name again?
Bob.
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
How old?
...Did ya fight last night?
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
Ya want the truth -- Ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- The only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire.
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
Don't let 'im get you tight.
How I look out there, Mick?
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
...Sure.
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
It don't matter.
Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
Ya really like her?
To see ya train.
Outta my house I want ya!!
Do you feel you have a chance?
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
You serve martinis, doncha?
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
What the hell's a freeway?
That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?
Toons aren't given imperfections.
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
Now what?
Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
You tricked me, damn you!
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
Yeah?
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
No better?
A challenge, on my life.
Is the day so young?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh?
At thy good heart's oppression.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
I come for my lady Juliet.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
That dreamers often lie.
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Right.
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
What wouldst thou have with me?
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
Is she a Capulet?
What?
And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
What is?
Hazard pay...
I still am.
You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract.  Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes.
Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care.  And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away.
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
Here's yours.
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
Whoever hired us.
So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
Then I guess we're set.
And you respect him.
If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
Who's they?
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
Like Larry or Swede.
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
We live in a singular world, my friend.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
You sure your friend got the right place?
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?
Dark ops?
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.  This is my job, I have to do it.
Let's get him out of here...
Finish the job...
I know.
Doing well.  This is?
A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
Do you have the tape?
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
Damn.
I don't know what you're -
I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
What are we going to do?
I do.  It's little shit like that sends people to jail! We have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
He would have done it to us, right?
And how do you figure we do that?
You said that last time!
You're out of your mind.
Maybe we should say somethin'.
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
And you're solid on that?
What's that?
Has he?
Hi.
Nothing's wrong.
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
How the hell did he find it?
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
How are we going to do all this?
Yeah, I've seen him.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Sheriff Hogan --
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Just goes to show you.
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  Id have found it in a minute.
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
Why?
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
What's this?
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.
Yeah let's hear about your day.
You'd do this to me?!
Dwayne -
Dwayne please calm down!
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
Anything in it?
Not in the trunk.
You think he skipped town?
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
Is this about the funny money?
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
So tell me what you know.
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
I said get on your feet!
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
What'd I say?
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
You.
He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
It's your turn!
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
What's a Chinese heaven?
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
Red Dragon.
What is Mac out?
Dancing?
That your gate down there?
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
Why don't you go get them?
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
Baby Duck?
Any leads?
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
Sir, I can explain.
Good job.
Feds asked for me?
Beach Boy.
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
Stooly.
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
You like it?
You want more?
What?!
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.
Like that.
Oh my god. Griffin.
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
No...what?
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
Yo, Johnson...
Don't play bullshit games with me.
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
Yes.
Yes.
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
No, that's what makes you unemployed.
Look, he's running after her.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
Yeah.
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
Of course we are.  Of course.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
I'm not sure.  Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't.  He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her.  I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.
It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
It's nice that they're still friends.
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
Kind of isolated.
About a minute...?
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
I love you.  I love you.
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?
It's probably because you got him fired.
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
Lighten up, what?
No, I'm just going to head home.
A harmless joke.
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.
Nope.
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
Happy New Year, darling.
Walter, I'd love to --
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
And then I'll see you in New York --
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
No.
It was my mother's.
That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
Right.
I know.
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
M.F.E.O.?
I love the symphony.
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
Howard.
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
What?
Which means --
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
How about rapacious and love- starved?
Hey, my plate is full.
Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda ... She's a weightlifter, but it's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything --
Seventy... eight.
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
Write her.
Window.
I don't know.  Do I?
Dad --
What?!
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
Somewhere in the middle.
It doesn't.  They ask you.
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.
Whose show was this on?
What was?
Bye bye blackbird.
I'm starting to forget her.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
Why is she bringing that bag?
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.
No.
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
Okay.
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
You look good.
We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
How goes it?
The woman question?
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
What do you mean -- sex equality?
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
Who? A scab?
He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula.  I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.
What makes you so sure?
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line?
You weren't waiting for me.
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
This is what we've been waiting for.
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
Go on. Spill it.
Luís! Come down here!
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
Not even a guess?
How?
What about the guy on the very bottom?
What?
Why not?
I can't leave.
Fuck you.
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
What happened to your eye?
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
What are you hiding, Danny?
It's me.
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
Why not?
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
Colette, go.
I don't want to leave you.
That's a good one.
Can I ask you something?
Was he the president?
Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you.
No one ever noticed?
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
Crank or glass?
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?
You want to do this some other time?
Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
What the hell is this?
Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
Don't you wonder why I do it?
When?
Murder.  Beautiful.
Turns out he's connected.
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
Tom, quit fucking around.
You think that's a good idea?
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
Here it comes, poor Tom.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
Find a chaplain.
Spit it out, Captain.
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
The Army gave you that?
Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch.
Shut up, will you?
We left them eighty-eights.
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
Say what, Cap'n?
I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.
You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?
I wasn't made for this.
I heard.
Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg.  The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor.  The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found.  The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone.
What about our grenades?
Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.
Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
Maybe.
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
How about I go right, sir?
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
What do you think?
Uh, oh.
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
Ours is not to reason why.
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Yes, sir.
You set?  Sarge nods.
Yes, Private.
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
Shit, sir.
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
No, no he's not.
This evening is over.
Yeah.
You're tough, J-man.
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
But you never had a first date.
Please?
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
Lloyd is doomed.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
Wait a minute.
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
Morning.
Bon voyage.
Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.
Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.
This is me telling you about me.
No, I read it on the message.
Busy?
Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"...
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
That's cool then.
What?
So what's your job this summer?
Yeah.
I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
Be friends?
Yeah.  With potential.
This is so noble.
I don't think I am.
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
What's wrong?
Yeah.
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
You shared it with a dick.
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
Alright, high level air safety tips.  If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?
The guy with the Datsun?
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
I'm totally and completely serious.
Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...
She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
Lloyd.
Hey.
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
Later for you, Luke.
What's your name?
Oskar, please -
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.
He's important to my business.
You took my workers.
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?
What's that?
The SS beat me up.  They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.
That's great.
What's wrong with it?
Good.  How's it going?
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
Yes.
What?
You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?
What other point is -
I'll talk to him.
I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more...
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
Would it do any good?
He's stealing from you, Oskar.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
thought he was doing AA.
Stop it...
What? I can't hear you...
What if I said you?
Hello? Ted?
Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
Hi, Gale, any leads?
Home--where he lives.
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
Where's Sid?
This is exactly what I don't want.
Let us decide that.
Two.
She's got guards with her.
Hello, Dwight.
So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
What are we looking for?
They're roomates.
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
What do you want?
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
You're getting obvious.
Time to change numbers again?
What about rehearsal?
That was good.
Who is that guy?
Easy black boy.
..harmonica style is okay.
What's your favorite scary movie?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
Asshole, Can't talk.
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
Jesus Gale what happened?
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
Excuse me?
What do you mean?
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
You used to say that was our strength.
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Would you excuse me for a moment?
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
Need to get in that building?
No really?
There a story in that building?
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
Hello.
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.
No.
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
I didn't kill anybody.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
I thought she was dead.
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
You know what my dad will do to you?
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
You lost your mom...
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
Yes.
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
Please don't do this...
...please...
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
And why is that? Has something happened?
We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.
You're sure it was the Hilton?
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
What's the plan?
Many times.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
Hello?
LEAVEMEALONE!
Don't come any closer.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
The why'd the police let him go?
She's saving herself for you.
And what would be your motive?
Why are they doing this?
And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.
Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
Just like old times, ain't it?
He was there, Tatum.
Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.
So you think my mom was a slut too?
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.
TATUM!
For once, Stu, drop it.
He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment.  He's been doing it for quite a while.  Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
Already.
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
I guess... decide for yourself.  I don't know what it says.  I'm going to go.
It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
I can't wait for you to see.  I can't wait...  It's really going to be something.
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
Who said this was murder?
This doesn't make any sense.
He must have left another puzzle piece.
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
Nothing.
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
You tell me.  I'm new in town.
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
Yes.  They were there... so, it must be.
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.  The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
What are you going to say?
What are you talking about?
How can you say that?  Especially after today?
You do your job...
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man.
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
What is it?
Kiss me on the lips.
Oh... um, William.
High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.
Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
Let's get along...
You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.
Dunno...Seems so.
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
You fit a lot of descriptions.
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.
I say NO!
Sir?
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good...
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
Well, the reward still stands...
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
You want us to fire a shot if...
Say it. We're beat!
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...
Because she's my...my...
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
Well, you're a widower now...
Lemme alone...
You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
She's not a little girl any more.
She'd be about thirteen now...
Why else?
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
What?
You know, after doing that job for so many years, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life.  Flowers incorporate a beauty that I always missed in life.  But certainly, you're not here to chat about my hobbies.
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
And that is?
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
Tenth floor.
It's good.
The title won't do.
Do you know that house?
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
On my mother's side the Ardens
So now you are free to love
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
What happened to Sam?
God be praised!  Locked?
Who is she this time?!
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
Fifty pounds? What for?
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
Cut round him for now.
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
And yours?
This is a different one.
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
Will!
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
I would not for the world!
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
Is she obedient?
Better fortune, boy.
The same, alas.
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
There is.
Even your play.
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
If you love her, you must do what she asks.
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
I  Her letter came to me by the nurse.
But what of Lord Wessex?
"Poet?"
You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell!
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
About this guy, this Hugo person.
I don't have time.
Only on expenses.
He couldn't get his car started.
You call them if you want.
No, not that.
Doesn't it worry you?
Looking for you? Yes.
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
Yeah?
About the mail --
But there's no --
No. Why should it?
That's it, then.
That's all?
That's right.
Yes.
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
-- which is --
Yes.
Did what?
Alex.
Stop nagging.
You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice.
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
You're frightened.
The perfect couple, I should say.
Interesting.
What?
Of course.
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
Of course.
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
No, I've never seen them.
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
Yes.
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
Exactly what I was --
I'm not sure --
I see.
Offering it for debate.
You can tell by the intonation.
I don't know, I think...
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
Why?
What do you expect me to do about it?
I know.
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
It isn't?
Okay.
No thanks.
I am not!
George!
You're late, George.
What!
You do it.
He's a very private person, actually.
Probably the bathroom.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
It's hot in here.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
What?
Did you?
Yeah?
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
One of my few virtues is discretion.
Yeah, baby...
-- don't you want to --
-- gee...
-- where'd you go?
-- very nice, very nice.
Mmmm --
Well then what are you trying to do-
I can't just let him stand by the door...
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
What for?
Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?
-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- how did you get here?
Call me!
Where?
I just... who what?
Keep moving --
How are you, baby?
What?
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
What about me?
You're different.
I am?
Yeah, baby.
Could I talk to you for a second?
I already said hello.
Egypt.
A friend dropped me off.
I've got to get her out of here.
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
Yes.
How many?
What? What? What? What? What?
Yeah, I know. Did you?
Did you?
What did you say?
No.
But Mr. Norman said --
Well, yeah.
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
Well, George, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but I invest for myself and a lot of particular people.
Oh yeah?
-- yeah?
All night.
But...
I wanna hear about it, George.
I wanna hear about it.
Who?
Me!
No.
I'll call you back.
A daytime soap opera.
I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
You and your touchy investors.
Jackie Shawn.
I know, I'm sorry.
Don't be silly.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
I would say so, yes.
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
-- He reached up and tore them.
Why don't you ask for another one?
Sort of.
I don't think so.
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
You mean they ate each other up?
Dad?
Why don't you want to talk about it?
Tony.
What about Room 237?
No I ain't.
Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
Danny?
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Why not?
Please...
Well how can I repay you?
That doesn't matter, sir.  You're the important one.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
What'll it be?
How's my credit in this joint anyway?
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
It's good to see you.
No charge?
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
Yes.
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
Yes.
You mean just leave the hotel?
Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you?
Jack...
Why?
Wendy...
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
Good morning Jack.  I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
Eight thirty.
Can I tell you kids something?
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
I've been hearing noises in there.
Rats...
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
Do I need one?
Yeah... sure.
I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
What?
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
Oh-huh.
Hold on.
What a shame!
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.
I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.
Amateurs 2
She's a pro.
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
I don't want to mess anyone up...
Sit down.
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
My what?
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
And whom would you call?
It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
Sometimes it's not enough!
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
But -- why?
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
He didn't do you a favor.
Okay -- no limo.
No nothing.
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
I can't go with you.
Well?
She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
You didn't shoot!
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger.
He's decent.
I'd rather sing than do anything!
We can't sing without her!  What should we do?
But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind.
Certainly not.
Stains of blood.
I will not allow it.  I will not!
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
Maybe you should take this.
Have they nothing to fear presently?
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
Chosen me?
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
It's spectacular.
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
Listen.
I hear nothing.
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by.
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.

I was getting worried.  Who was it?
How are you?
Forgive me, I didn't know.
Small talk.
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.
You made this, and the drawings?
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
And this gives worth to butchery?
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
What... what are you doing... ?
It was you there?
I have not been able to face him yet.
Ichabod...
The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.
You cannot kill what is already dead.
Let her go!
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
No one will believe your lies, whore.
I can't remember.
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
Is him stayin' here workin' out?
You have any biscuits for sale?
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
It's too big.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
Yeah.
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
Leave.
Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
What's in your bag?
I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
Don't you live somewhere?
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
Yeah.
I don't want to worry your mama with company.
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
Why did he do that, reckon.
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
I like the way you talk.
Yeah.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
Pull on your works. Your privates.
Naw.
Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
A boy or girl?
She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early.
Can we play ever' Saturday?
Yeah, I guess.
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
I've got a feelin' today.
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
You all right, Mama?
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.
I'm ye boy.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
Tolerable, I reckon.
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
My name's Jerry Woolridge.
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
Is he leaving right this minute?
No! At least I don't think I am!
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
And what are you, his chaperone?
Better make it charge. 
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
What about for you?
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?
How'd you get started?
A photographer ...
It's kind of overwhelming.
What do you mean?
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
So. Are we ready?
Every word.
She probably died.
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
It's all yours, baby.
Seventeen.
Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?
Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
What is this, some kind of joke?
Thanks for the tip.
Is your name Paul Benjamin?
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
No thank you.
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
It'll cost you five bucks.
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
Well?
Huh?
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
Thanks, but I'll manage.
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias. 
Three nights.
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
What time did you get to bed last night?
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.
Good thinking.
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
Medium rare, please.
Yes, please.
I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.
That's obvious.
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
Is that your third question?
It is.
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare.  Even though it was too large f...
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Closer to eight.
Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.
We discussed that.  And decided not to.
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
Did you write that column?
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
Did you say more?
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
You gonna climb that with one arm?
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
What makes you think I play?
You must think I like losing.
And what's that?
You want me to say that.
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?
So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?
Obviously.
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
He had no reason to.
Get lost, will you?
You know, Bienstock, there's something funny about those two new girls.
Upsy-daisy.
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
Where are we running, Joe?
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
Hello, everybody.  I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.
Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
Me?  After Sugar?
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
With ME?
That's right.
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
What happened?
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Joe -
Sugar?
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?
Are my seams straight?
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
That's ridiculous.
What's the surprise?
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
Not you, Sugar.
What's that?
Well, I'll come back later.
I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.
Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!
Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?
You don't say.
Well, I'll be - !  He does have a bicycle.
Daphne...
Pleased to meet you.
To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
It's not the backs that worry me.
Well, here we are.
Oh.
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
Yeah.
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
I wish they'd put us in the same room.
Saxophone player?
You're not hurt, are you?
Which one is yours - the big one?
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
How's the stock market?
Tonight?
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
Well, I guess I'd better go -
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
Completely.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
How can you think about food at a time like this?
Would you do me a favor?
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Really?
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
Yes, they're here.  Oh - white orchids.  Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante.  What's this?
Daphne -
Good evening, sir.
I come to the old lady's funeral.
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
That's an opera, you ignoramus.
Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
Yes, sir.
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--
We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.
You know what? Im not having this conversation right now.
If Ed ever found out....
Or Kat....
Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
Does Kat know?
Wheres Nick sleeping?
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
I look like a total wanker, dont I?
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.
Let me guess. Amy presumed Id forget the rings.  I think Im her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, were the past. Im not sure if you noticed, but Im here with someone else.
Not for a dog.
Why?
You quitting?
Who are they?
Have you ever done anything like this before?
A weekend?
How did you know that was me?
Yes.
When I said Id never done a wedding before, I didnt say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
And thats when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
You don't live around here, do you?
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
And you say all them people is dead now?
Colored.
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
You could? How?
Nothin'...
What do that mean?
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
You learnin' anything at that school?
Hi, Daddy...
That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
You feel alright today, Daddy?
When's that?
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!
Be good and be smart, little boy.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
Dammit, I'm talkin' to you, woman! I gotta farm to think about and I need answers.
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
Will they give him a trial?
About what?
What?
Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway.
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
Hey Cartman.
Come on, just get to the message board!
Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
Oh you poor dear. You've been through so much...
Mkay.
Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-
What's going on, Chef?
Yes I am!
What's the password?
SHIT!
That's gonna take a long time!
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
It's okay, I am done for.
Nowhere.
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
I don't know, dude.
I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
Wow, a lot of people showed up.
Stan!
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
The F word?!
But I-
Hello, Conan!
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
Don't call me dumb!
<b>What if I, don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature, I have feelings too, I don't need this abuse from you-</b>
Check.
Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
Were you going to give it to them?
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
If anyone can hear me please respond!
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?
Is that clear?
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
He certainly is polite.
Explosive?
What?  What are you talking about?
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Will you marry me?
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
Oh no...I think there's carrots in here...
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
What kind of man?
99 years, 241 days,  15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling. Alfie shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down.
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
Theo's bowled on the tour.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
That game was before you was born.
It's mine.
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin.
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
Hello, mom?
JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
Who's there?
What if he wants to get out?
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
Where's Junior?
I bet you didn't know that you and Junior have something in common, Theo: Junior can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup bottle down on Junior's right hand. The table settings jump from the shock. Junior sits impassively, his face a blank.
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
Grasp firmly. Then what?
Like this?
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
Do those two work for your dad or mine?
I came here to have a word with your dad.
Won't your father help you with that?
Everything has it's drawbacks.
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.
Do you have a girlfriend?
No. Do You?
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
Then it's true, isn't it? About...
How do you get this thing down?
Are you sure he's dead?
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
Fuck plan C!
Some unfinished business.
Tell your little pal to let go.
Calm down, Dr. Levine.
Back away then.
What is it?
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
Norman!
They told me about sixty hours.
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
We're moving fast considering the storm.
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
Extraordinary, isn't it?
It doesn't make any sense.
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
Picked up something?  What is it?
Harry's missing.
What do you mean, he's missing?
Wait a second --
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
Any sign of Harry?
To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
It's chipped.
Ted?  Captain?
Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
What?
A half a mile long?
I want a name.  A real name.  This thing's full name, rank and serial number.
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
Edmunds?
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
Because when we get down there --
My gosh, Norman.
Beth --
Norman.
What are they?
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
It's not worth the risk.
The refridgerator.
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
You think?
You don't believe me.
Page 87.
What?
Manifested?
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
Sintag.
How long does it last?
Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
I'm sorry.
For what?
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
Do you fear them?
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
But --
You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
Beth --
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
Don't fuck with me, Beth.
Beth, stop it!
Beth?
I --
Beth --
What are you looking for?
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
You're staring at me.
Is it coming from our own computer?
You sound defensive.
C'mon, Norman.
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
Did I?
You don't remember that?
Her suit's gone.
She's cracking, Norman.
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
How do we decode it?
We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
Her legs are in the way.
You know how to work this thing?
No idea.
Well, press something!
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
Looks like a design, some writing, maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.
Well, if it's a discharge --
Beth and Harry?
That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...
What was that, sir?
Huh?
Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.
He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
What?
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
I'll get the information.
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.
You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
They use the Bogan Force.
What's wrong?  What's happening?
You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.
You're Starkiller?
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
Who's the pilot?
I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.
No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!
This isn't going to work.
And you?
You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
Mobile Infantery rules !
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
Did you read her mind ?
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
Please continue, Sergeant.
You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
You always told me you couldn't do human...
So what are you doing later ?
You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
Why not ?
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
A lot can happen in three minutes.
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower !
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
Is that your signature, Rico ?
I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !
Well, yeah, sure...
Can you walk ?
What is it, Rico ?
Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?
This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
... but I still recommend further simulation study.
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.
Captain, what's the next move?
Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need to fulfill itself?
Viewer ahead.
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.
And whatever you sensed out here....
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
What should you have known?
These read as identical composition...  ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
Child...!?
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
Dock control reports ready, sir.
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
Then you'll be wet.
Why?
But why the dalmation?
Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>.  As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...
Of course.
Goodbye.
...such a pleasant sound.
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
Uh huh.
What?
...lost the screw...
Fix my glasses.
Oh, God...
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
Yes.
...he stuck a fishhook in it. 
She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
Hi.
Is it...
Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...
What would you do with it, the printshop...
That's something a man could do...?
Good morning.
Not without a rolltop desk.
Well, I for one, am glad of a little diversion and I'm glad they're here...
We did...?
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?
I'm sorry.
He works on the movie.
Town ain't got no courthouse.
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
It'll hurt the box office.
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
...why am I here...?
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
Alright.  Let's...  Page five, the fucking <u>horse</u> dies.  You know, <u>she</u> could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, <u>wife</u>...?  It could be his...
Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a <u>schoolnight</u>, something...
So you see what I'm <u>saying</u>...the movie is about <u>purity</u>...
I'm very sorry to...
Of course he...
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
I've got scene <u>twelve</u>...  Shouldn't you be in school...?
I wasn't in the car.
Look.
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
I like you, too.
We're just talking about the...
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
I know that...
Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
...yes...
You show Claire these sketches?
She won't stop crying...
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
Hi.
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
A witness to what...?
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
He saw the accident...?
I'm trying, honey...I'm...look, is your Ma, when is your <u>Mom</u> coming?  Oh.  What did the <u>midwife</u>...?
Did you, where are we going tonight...?
You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
I can't.
Why?
The movie's about <u>purity</u>.  So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
Know?  They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic.  What a find you are. Get outta here.  We need the Dead Horse Scene.
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
It's just a formality.
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
And we're glad to have you here...
...the damn thing...
She coulda done better than him.
Bet you did.
Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy sol...
Mass hysteria.
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
Scream.
I hope it's the right kind.
She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
Mom?  What's wrong?
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
She still packing for her trip?
Annabelle pick up the phone.
You think this is funny?
You're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
Help me here...
Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!
You do NOT run out on your moth...
You know, this horse smells really bad.
...your hating me.
But you told us to starve.
...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
Mommy?
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
Yes.
You have the WORST flu since...
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Okay.  These are good.
But you can still see him.
It's not good enough.
May I remind you that Duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac...
That's necessary, huh?
I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
Called him.  We set an ap...
To make it easier for them or you?
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...
You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
Yes?
Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
Moi?
So.  Hopeful.
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
My advice to you?  Don't die.
You really didn't have to come, you know.  I'd have brought them straight t...
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.
Thanks for coming out.
I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...
Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
Ben never mentioned it.
You'll learn.
Not yet.
Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...
Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
She's not gonna die.
Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different.
'...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said.  But I didn't leave.
Maybe he's gay.
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
Thank you.
Great to be here.
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
I'm still poor.
I'm always working.
My Jesus
Who is Jesus?
You have a bay?
Oh. How did it happen?
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
We're not ready!
Twinkeys!
We used pull.
Well, I changed the ending a little.
So you don't want to hear my new ending?
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
Fuck!
Scooby?
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
Thanks.
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
That's too bad.
N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
Three.
Eight, six, and four.
Thanks.
What is most important to you?
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
Well, I-I hope that--that--
What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
What now?
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
What are you talking about?
How well do you know this place?
That's it!  Up ahead!
I hope you don't mind all this--it's just that the networks will eat it up, you know...
Came over the satellite.  We're keeping the bird clear should they call back.
Well?
What the hell is it, anyhow?
How goes the roll call?
Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.
What's happening at the waterfront?
Good.
Don't be ridiculous.
What's the meaning of this?
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
Get a grip on yourself, Major!
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
What about the President?
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
That's a very wise deduction, General.
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
Why do you think I ask?
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
That is correct, Major.
Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.
I suppose they are, sir.
How much soda, sir.
What shall we drink to, sir?
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
Where, sir?
Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
Yes, sir.  But so do we.
Right.
Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
Major, you're talking like one of them!
But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
Do you think we'd cheat?
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
They're coming in now.
How many planes did we lose?
Naturally I am, sir.
If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
Check.
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Call them every five miles.
Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.
Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
Yeah?
Wing attack, Plan-R.  That's exactly what it says.
Some kind of signaling.
Master safety.
You sure have to hand it to those guys.
You tell me.
Then that settles it, doesn't it?
Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?
Let me check.
I don't anymore.
Intense.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
Mm-hm.
Responsibility, progress.
Typical male.
Uh, home, you know.
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
No, no.
No, I'm not worried.
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Shit.
Yes! Free concert!
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape?
You better! Yes!
Hey, we're just having a conversation.
It's okay.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
Please.
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
Will you stand up for me?
Come on. Inside.
Hi.
Hi.
He is?
He is.
What'd he get you?
A Porsche.
Mm.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
Mm-hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for Chinese food.
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water.
Uh-huh.
You don't need to sit next to me right now.
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
That chick, Erica?
You lied to me.
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
I don't know.
They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
No.
Like what?
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
Nothing.
No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
I've run out of words.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
Good, man.
Like songs?
Really?
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
What?
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Look, get down off my property.
Look Pakeesa...
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
Yeah.
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
Yeah.
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
I can't believe you're still here.
You do?
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities!
Di, we're sorry.  We...
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
Y'think?
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
Uh, Jack - look, I can explain...
Madonna.
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
You're kidding.
I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
Look, maybe I can watch a PG movie... I'll just say I'm counting dirty words for Sunday School.
Uh...maybe?
My what?
My best friend got pregnant.
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
Roll 'em.
Give me your coat.
Good party.
Sure, this'll go on all night.
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
Well....
Stop it, Artie, will you?  Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
I was afraid of that.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.
Oh, you --
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
From Artie.  What's wrong?
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
What assistant?
And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
What's the matter, Norma?
We've missed you too, dear.
Get out.
That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
Just a minute, you!
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
I will not have it butchered.
You'll like it here.
What scene?
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
Joe,  you look absolutely divine.  Turn around!
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
Keep it.
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
How did it go?
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.
I haven't done anything, Norma.
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
No, they don't.
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
You are not dressed properly.
Suppose you listen just for a minute -
Good.
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
Oh, you're one of the message kids.  Just a story won't do. You'd have turned down Gone With the Wind.
Now wait a minute.  If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.
No?
Bring something to drink.
Who?
The cameras have arrived, Madame.
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
What does it mean?
He will be. In about five minutes.
Eliminate her.
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
What do you want?
I'm taking you to the hospital.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
I have to.
You love me?
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
All this talk about love, it's silly.
Let me kiss you.
Is this how?
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
I don't love you any more.
You think so?
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
They think I have a concussion.
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
You vicious--
I don't know. You seem afraid.
Why George, are you proposing?
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
You bet your ass.
I don't understand.
I can do that.
How'd you do that?
But what for?
I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
What is this place?
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
Are you happy, Zaltar?
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
You can use the wand.
Not enough vodka in it.
The kid needs a man to show him --
Too much mayonnaise?
You...um...you never got married?
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
Uh...excuse me, folks...
But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
What kind?
Thirty-five.
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
How many sugars?
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
Uh...
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
What will it do?
Yeah? How's it look?
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
How you doing down there?
No, we're just going down.
We gonna crash?
You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
Ricky?  Where...what...
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
"At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining." ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace.
I can't see anything.
Gus?
Oh, Superman!
I can't! It's out of control!
85,000 dollars.
Storms! Floods!
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
Lois, what are you doing?
Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
Superman? Oh, was he here?
I was right. you are Superman.
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
You're not selfish at all.
You do?
Everything on it?
Uh...home...
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
A parka.
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
What's a curl?
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
Now This I want to hear.
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
I asked the right question.
DELETE IN CUTTING
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
Constantly.
He has powers as we do . . .
What do you want?
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
There is something more you want. The 								greed is written on your face.
Free!
Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
Gee, I don't think . . .
Oh . . . my . . .
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
The one Superman wrecked up?
What was that about?
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
Bunkers!
Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
You're a great architect, Albert.
It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --
Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
Don't worry, Mom. I know.
Mom...
I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
I'll bet you have some good ideas.
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
You're just jealous.
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
Your father was a sick weirdo.
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
They stop for nothing.
Don't let me down.
Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
It's a ...baby.
Oh, dear. That isn't what I --
It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here, he'll be as dead as...
He will be odd, different.
Right on the first guess.
Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.
I guess they are a little odd.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
Do you like pink?
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.
You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
She's in trouble?
What happened?
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
What are you thinking?
I stopped by the station a while ago.  I stared at the bus.  I could almost hear the kids inside.  There was a lawyer there.  He told me he'd gotten you signed up.  Is that true?
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
Berries.
A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him.  He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six.
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
He knows that?  Billy?
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
That's what he said, is it?
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
How was it?
So do you like your new room?
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take a load off.
Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
It was snowing.
Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
Perfect.
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
DADDY!!!
Daddy?
You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.
Do you have the blood test?
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
No.
Yes.
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
And where did you sit that morning?
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
You saw the speedometer?
There wasn't time?
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
You remember this?
What took so long?
The ramp?
Do you like the colour?
The door needs a lock.
It's because of the accident, Nicole.  Most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers.  A lot of people...well, people in this town are very angry. Us included.
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
Where are we running?  What am I missing here?
Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please.
You told him that?
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill.  Just give us the punch line...
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
If looks could kill, I'm dead...
I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in!
I'm taking up the situation with you now...
When I'm certain, I'll let you know...
Susie, I'm sorry if---
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
I got that boy coming over here.  What's so funny?
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
What does that mean - integrity?
Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- I'll just lay it on the line!  What about that big rumpus in my office today?  You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear!
- He's got them on him.
Could this be that boy?
I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house?
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
If that's for me, tear it up!
Did you send my folks in Philly the check...?
You're talking very fast.
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!
No, I don't mind.  I'm busy too.
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.
Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --
Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  Meet the pilot.
Those lying motherfuckers!
Where we going?
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
Not even of dying?
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
Torque wrench please.
You will.
Why do you cry?
She intends to change the future somehow.
I'll deal with the police.
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
Easy money!
It, John.  Not him.  It.
Mom?  You okay?
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
Why him?
Where do you stand on all this?
That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
I guess it's possible.
Five minutes.
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwängler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
You live here, in Berlin?
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
Major, Major... he's here ...
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?
I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
May I ask a question?
Your guess is as good as mine.
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?
You won't find it because no such telegram exists.
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
Tell me about von der Null.
And what happened to Von der Nul?
Stop this, please, stop this now!
Do you know what that is?
I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?
I've remembered something else...
Oh! The evening before, I see...
You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
So, you never heard of him.
First oboe.
Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.
Can you handle it?
What do you think?
Great.
Freezing.
Reese...you got a first name?
I caught one, back there.
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
Good field-dressing.
Kyle?
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
Hot dogs?
Sarah.
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
Give me the short version.
Send a unit.
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.
It was an accident.
A game?
It was a gift... from my brother.
You pull me up.
What's C.R.S.?
You deserted me.
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
You're the one who started running.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
That's classic.
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
What are you doing here?
Where'd you get this?
Do you mind if I sit?
What's wrong?
What are you doing... ?
How?  How could they have gotten anything?
What did you say?
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
What?
Where'd you get that gun?
We searched the house.
Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
I saw them kill him!
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
Nicholas...
No...
Claire.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Like... where are you from?
Yes.
Underwear?
You look good.
So do you.  And to think I was worried...
How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
Really?
Why?
This isn't an escort service?
I'm going to call.
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
Yeah, almost...
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
Robbed?
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
What kind of vacation?
It's different every time.
May I make two suggestions... ?
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
How long will these take?
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
I've been so lonely.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Hm?
Didn't I give you two?
Mr. Van Orton... ?
You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
I don't like her.
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Nicholas...
Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
You're joking.
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.
Luke, can I talk to you?
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
Nell --
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
The cold sensation.  Who felt it first?
Nell!  What's wrong?
What happened after you smelled it?
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
Are you coming to confess?
No.
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
That's where she hanged herself.
Why would we --
It's all I could afford.
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Then what good is he?
As soon as you get dressed.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
Italian.
What's the matter?
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
Why not?
Same as last time -- the rest after.
When you find the guy, you'll know.
Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
What kind?
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
We'll find him.
You're in gun country now, my friend.
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.
He's brought in the heavy mob.
What?
Steady on.
Do you have any friends, man?
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
Well, those are the breaks.
You just cooking then?
You look alike.
That's not what I heard.
Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
Oh, it just ended, then.
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
How'd you manage that, then.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
-- Your employer?
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
Why not.
Who remembers.
I've 'ardly ever left it.
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
He alive to see this?
What'd your father do?
I guess you're just habitual.
Up the coast.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
Sounds like you need a rest.
Five thousand.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
There is?
How we gonna get that lucky?
He's expecting you?
You know her?
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Thanks.  You, too.
What.
...Yes?
...I stank, didn't I?
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
Ah... it's nothing.
Huh.
Ah yes, a music lover.
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
...she can go up there.
Right! Strictly business.
...You bring a check?
Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
All right.
She's a rare one.
Uh-huh.
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
Big Dave--
...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.
Dave.
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
Should I... should I tell you why?
Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?
--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* killed him. How come?
...I don't get it.
No thanks.
Says here that the Russians exploded n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.
Russians exploded an A-bomb.
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
Yeah.
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
What the--
What'd he say?
Doesn't bother me.
Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...
Uh... you're under arrest.
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.
Behind you.
Battery's dead.  Shit.
What doors?
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
Whose footprints?
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
Vince?  There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
The sub-basement?
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
I hope you liked it.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.
A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.
Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."
Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?
How many storage areas are there?
Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
What's that?
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
I have the species identification on these teeth.  We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program.  Call Dr. Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
You were going to be married.
My God.  Then it was an animal.
What happened?
We have to try and draw it off!
How?
Help someone!
What?
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
That's right.
What happened down there?
We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.
That and a fat, new contract.
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
The memory of who?
Yeah?  Outta what?
Marlon--
When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
Yeah...
Where have you been?
I know.
I made macaroni.
Good night, Mother.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
What do I do?
I won't be here Sunday.
When you get to Fiji?
The whole area's being evacuated.
They're going to stop me talking to you.
Well, we're FBI agents.
They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
I need your clothes, Byers.
Of what?
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
Have you examined them?
You a reporter?
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
I'll know soon enough.
Negotiating with whom?
I think they have that covered.
No you didn't.
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
Where are you, Mulder?
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
What? What are you talking about?
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
It may be extraterrestrial.
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
Cold...
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
Mr. Mulder.
About the conspiracy?
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
What alien environment?
My god...
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
I do it all the time!
Agent Novak?
Why'd you bring him here?
What now?
I need you to find something in the basement...
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
That's a secret.
Give her some cigarettes.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
I don't know. They didn't answer.
You shouldn't get mixed up in this.
Harry?
Oh, that was many years ago.
It's just what he used to say.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
Let's go away.
I'm going back home.
...Headquarters.
Here, it will be cold on that train.
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
You can help us.
Where's Harry?
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
Must you take those?
They'll be returned, miss.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
What is it?
My name is Calloway.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
...in the morning.
I followed his shadow until suddenly...
No.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
How about the doorway?
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
A girl of spirit.
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
Very good, sir.
...of Santa Fe."
No, a major, were you really?
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
Seems exciting.
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
I want to talk to you.
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
Why not?
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
Martins.
Mr. Lime - yes.
...Popescu...
Yes.
You don't mean that doctor?
No.
Joseph Harbin.
What's the purpose of your visit here?
Lime.  Harry Lime.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
Traveler.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
So how many miles do you think it is?
Richard - I saw a fin!
What!
A shark fin?
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.
We swim.
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.
Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?
What do you think you're doing?
Do we have to listen to this shit?
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
Fire...
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
Oh, really?
It looks a little like a swastika.
Where are they?
Even though his dick is so big?
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
I told you, I'm good at this.
You want a punch in the mouth?
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
An investment banking house.
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?
A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
So you're saying it's not true.
Give me a reason not to.
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
From the Rhineland originally.
We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
How have things been going?
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk.
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
Steve...
What are you doing here?
Nobody ever beat me up.  Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
You said they didn't have night guards.
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
Why me?
Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head.
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...
Who's this?
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
You're going to live here permanently?
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
You're leaving?
What kind?
Johana, am I boring you?
I tell you she's mine!
In a lake.
Congratulations, Enzo.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
Don't.
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
That's good.
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
Everything about what?
Two years younger than you.
Here...  Here...
He doesn't like us.
... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything!
You were right.
... I was right about what?
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
You look adorable.
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
I'd better get back now.
... No?
How can you tell it's a female?
I did?
Why?
Do you know how it is?  Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
You'll try again tomorrow?
You want to lie down for a while?
Why?
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
So. Do you have a name?
What do you want me to do?
Any sign of Santa?
Keep going.
Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
Happy Hanukkah Tikva.
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
North -- in an arroyo, Shot through the head - maybe week ago. No good, skin, everything gone 
It's a blackcard and bad card, but not the card of the cat - not the card of fourfooted things.
) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
Cut.
He will be waiting...
That's right, of course.
Why?
More or less.
There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
Why did you give up teaching?
Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
You're too good to me.
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
And I never will- you know what's between us  we're a thing But this is serious competition.
	As long as my feet held out.
Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside - where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
It's a lovely town - it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
Must it?
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says closed to the public, doesnt it?
Im afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistresss brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
And that is the last time any...
Excuse me?
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.
Perhaps I should come back when youre...
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. Theyre in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
Yes... You woke me up... Its the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
When did you get back?
Youre mad...
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? Hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Leon hung himself.
Adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didnt he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Leon hung himself...
Leon hung himself...
Kids are not your thing, Deborah. Youd have been ready for me when I turned up with Sleeping Beauty. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. Not Leon, you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didnt say My God!, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. Not Leon. Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman Id stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at £15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didnt you?
Good.
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
I didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
Dont you believe in simplicity?
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
So you did talk about it, huh?
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
I dont know. Everyones dead...
Why the hell couldnt you divorce the man?
By your Austrian?
You dont know why hes come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what were doing here?
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
Look, you dont tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Whos the guy? The Austrian?
Were both thinking the same thing, right?
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think Ill get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, itll be too late.
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
Whats the Ambassador?
What about the staff?  Theyre in on whats going on, arent they?  How many of them?
B-Black...
Must be your lucky day then. Ive got your accounts - you dont owe much tax for last year.
So you havent seen the film, then?
Ive got work tonight, Jane.
Yes. How did...
I didnt mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
Problems?
Is my money in there?
Lets go.
I dont know what your problem is, but...
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Trying to say something, Martin?
The Hyatt...? Whats that?
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leons Austrian was looking for you I reckon hed have found you before I did.
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leons story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
I... How long have I been here?
Huh... I guess you aint quite ready for civilisation yet... Ill give you one more day, a meal, and then youre on your way.
Welcome to the club.
Uh-huh.
Mon bureau coûtait trop cher.
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
Youre sure he said his caller was a man?
What you gonna do? Kill me?
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
Now?
What... what do you mean?
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
I want to stay with you...
One day you will.
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
No...
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
Who's running this trial, you or her?  I can't believe it!  This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born?
How old are you?
Were you baptized?
Please... may I have it back...
And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
I'm... I'm not the king...
You did well...
She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all!
My captains have sworn their support.
If there was, I didn't see it...
Does he have hair?
5,000 gold crowns.
8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!
Yes, it's a miracle.
And... what does Jeanne think?
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Besides, what about these...?
Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
Jeanne... what are you doing?
Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?  Are you God?
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
Why were you yelling like that?!
What do you mean, they won't come?
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
Are you going to leave me too?
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
Then... why are you here so often?
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
Only God knows the answer to that.
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
You can't, it's too dangerous.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
Really?
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
What did I tell you?
Let me see this.
Calm down, what, what is it?
Halina?
What?
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
What's this about?
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
But I want to help, I want to.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
What's happening?
Are the Russians here?
Watch your feet!
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
Ohhh I've never been there. 
The piano.
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
You mean in signs?
We can't leave the piano
Is it all right? Aren't you going to play something? ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly takes ~p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her happiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART.
That's right.
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
How much did ya lose?
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
I just got the count.  We'll put the take on the 4:15.
There's always a depression on.
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
Everything go all right?
Did he say he wouldn't?
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
You beat him, kid.
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
See and raise 1,000.
Who are you?
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
2:00 A.M.
What does this guy want?
I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'.
You move right along, don't ya.
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?
What happened to your face?
How am I gonna do that?
You want a drink or something?
You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
You weren't hired to miss him.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
Yes.  He admitted it.
Said he stole his invention.
Oh, Andy.
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
Give it to me.
What is it?
Then what are you hiding?
Why... in the heart.
Which way did she fall?
She... she fell over backwards.
Forgive me.  How are you?
Where are you going?
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
I know -- I know --
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
Better get home before it is.
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
Shrapnel!
Have you got a pistol permit?
No.
Could this be him?
Do you think that Wynant did it?
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
We're just having a little drink.
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
Oh, please, Nick.
No.
Thanks, and goodbye.
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.
Dorothy!  Is she here?
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
Oh, did he?  What did he say?
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
I didn't knock Julia off.
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
By the way, how is your father's side?
Six Martinis.
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
Can't you get to sleep?
Maybe a drink would help you.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
Nick!  Nick!  There's someone to she you,
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
Did I give it to you?
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Your guess is as good as mine.
Why don't you?
What are you going to do?
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
Not with all your money!
Sure I will.
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
I did find him!
It was his body that was buried there.
Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
It's the only way it makes sense.
No, Mr. Charles.
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
Nick Charles here?
Yes.
Was he a good detective?
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
They stopped.
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
You don't know that.
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
No.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
It's just a mongoose.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
How!?
We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.
Wes is dead!
Sure.
Yeah.
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.
What do we do?
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
People are suffering.
Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.
You get it yet?
Naw, nothing.
You will.  You'll get it.
That's in two days.
God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
What do you think?
What the hell are you doing!?
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
I think he wants something to drink.
Drug evasion with....
What's this?  Why did you change it?
Now?
I don't know.
Then why did you bring it up?
I've never been under the table before.
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
We're leaving.
I can't see him at all.  He's been destroyed.
Well?
I've got it!  Astounding!
I was lost.
...it doesn't matter.  The rest of it just didn't happen.
Maternity ward, huhh!
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence:  Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5.  Roommate 3417 LU...H.
Yes.
May I help you?
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
I don't know. You tell me?
Yep.
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
Keep talking.
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
I don't know.
How the hell do you feel yellow?
Right.
Bev, you're the greatest...
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap.
Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston, New York, Philadelphia... but no real match
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Oh shit...
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
Nice to be here.
What?
What's this?
I promised her she'd be safe.
still studying the vase. Mariette appears. He turns to her.
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
With the compliments of Colet and Company!
Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the feeling we have met somewhere before.
No.
I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
You can trust me.
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
Monescu.
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
No, thank you.
Thank you, Baron.
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
Certainly!
Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
I remember.
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
Make it out to cash!
Beautiful specimen.
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
Ye-es?
You're conceited--
I know it.
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
Call the police?
Adolph J. Giron.
Giron...!
No, m'sieu!
To me he seems rather nervous.
Your bag?
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
What?
Rose Calvert.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.
Sure. Count me in.
Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.  Sorry Fabrizio.
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
The fall alone would kill you.
How cold?
Ever been to Wisconsin?
No.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
Is he your boyfriend?
If only it were that simple.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
No, no! Just with her hands.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
Do you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to the winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish?
Anya, I think you're crazy.
How'd you ever get away with it?
Will you leave me alone?
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
Married?
Okay.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
Sorry.
I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
Nix, the law!
A dollar forty.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
No, sir?
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
How's your mother feeling?
I thought you were a sucker--
I'm going to the show--
This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
Why?
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
I'll go with you.
No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
In New York.
How?
Sure.
Send that.
Next month is June.
Well, did you find me?
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
I was never stiffer in my life.
Oh, there you are--
You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Are you happy?
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
I don't get the humor of that remark.
Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
What for?
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
No!
Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.
Ain't got time.
Isn't that a daisy?
Oh, my God...
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
I don't understand.
Age quod agis.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
You don't even know him.
Ignore her?
What does he want?  He wants revenge.
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.
Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him.  You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell, He's the best that's ever been. 'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.
I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
Just doesn't, that's all.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall.
I didn't mean it that way.
Wyatt!  My God...
What can I get you?
Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you'd join back up with us.
Run for your lives, boys!  It's That great two-gun dog-catcher From Kansas!
Really?  What about hell?  They got A sign or what?
Dropped him, that was it.  Sorry If I made a worse mess for you.
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
Look pretty rough.
Acquired?
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
They're carrying guns in town.
What about all these saloons?
It's too late -
Sir Elliot.
By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?
You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both men of action. But your era is passing. Words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery. And make no mistake about it: In the right hands, they can be as deadly as your Walther PPK.
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
- We all want what we can't have?
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
- Four wheel drive?
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
Oh, James. I've missed you -
Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys.
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
Happily.
Three. You? Married?
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
Down?
Sakwa!
No -
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
What the hell is going on?
Oh, no.
I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late.
Soon as I rest a bit.  I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
Like muddy waters?
Who is it?
What is that?
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
Well, you just have to move further out.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window
Everything these days is made overseas.
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
That smells like fresh coffee.
Hattie is a different person now.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
What's a toby?
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
Where is Skip?
Can I bring some toys?
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
But what if we leave them behind?
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Hey, watch it!
No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
MOM!!  MOM!!
That ain't no happy child.
Laser-envy.
Toss 'im overboard!
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
I'm red this time.
A sin against <i>what?</i>
She'll have to learn.
Go away.
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
It was only a mouthful!
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
How long has -
I already lost everything once.
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
Did you do this?
One thing bothers me...  That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
How long have you known?
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
About the other night, I'm sorry.
God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
None of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual Drug Czar.
What's up?
Helena --
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
You can't make me.
...How old are you?
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
Chill out --
She ain't in on it.
I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
So does half of San Diego.
Arizona.
When will you do it?
So, it's worth the wait, right? What can I do?  Rent a Huey?  Have an airlift?  It's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule's asshole, right?  How many peasants would that take?  A line stretching from here to Mexico City --
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
We aren't barbarians.
Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?
It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.
We agree.
An informant.
If I can.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
What is it you want me to do?
Does this offer include my partner?
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
I got money.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
You won't say anything to my parents?
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
What?
I don't know, maybe we missed her.
You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel.
Yes, I hope so as well.
Hello.
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --
What kind of research?
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
I'll be right after you.
Twenty thousand.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
It's a scandal, Franco.
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
Thanks.
Diane.
What?
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
So why have you told me about it?
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
Right.
A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre.
You Only Live Twice?
Lewis Gilbert.
Screenwriter?
Eh - Ian Fleming?
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.
You don't know, do you?
So who else?
Say something, Mark, say something --
It was my fucking television.
So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
How's it going with Gail?
Six weeks!
No, no, it's not possible.
Following new course. Warp seven.
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
Because it's there.
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
"Row, row, row your boat..." I love "Row..."  Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"
Goodnight, Spock.
But he does seem familiar?
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
Be one with the horse.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
There, you see? See?
Is what possible?
It would appear we are too heavy.
Spock.
Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart  Spock?
I must have your starship.
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
What are you doing?
No... I didn't.
Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
No special conditions?



I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
I cannot go with you.
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
You invented Space Paranoids?
Beautiful!
I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
Oh. Anything else?
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
What do you want with the Pentagon?
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
User requests are what computers are for.
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
How about over there...that empty memory?
Flynn!!
You're alive!
But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
Not us, I hope.
A User -- in our world?
Flynn, we've got to help him!
Why? What are you going to do?
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
Feel what? You okay?
Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
Thank. you, Master Control.
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
Yes, MCP.
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
And this is a little above market-				* rate for the horizontal bop, even				* for a total biscuit like her.
Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
Probably because it sounds scary.				*
Harry?  HARRY?!
What's this for?
What a team.  See you at eight.
Thanks dear.
Kids.  Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
Station wagon?
What's the plan?
Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --
You want me to just hang-- ?
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
Give me the page.
She's lying.
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
Any minute now.
But you didn't.  Why not?
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
What did you tell him?
Look, I know you're upset.  I'm really sorry, honey.  I raced home as quick--
What did happen?
He needed my help.
This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?
My husband can't know about this.
No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
Yeeaoowww!!
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
Like one?
Are you sure you weren't followed?
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name?
What do you want me to do?
You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?
That was so good I am gonna have another.
... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here.". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go.
I took a cab.
Would you like to get some pie?
Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.
Very much. Now, where were we?
Turn-offs?
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
You have a pimp?
You will?
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
Really?
Cancoon.
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
What?
Can you live with it?
Yeah.
She's with me.
Alabama, could you tell Clar -
I certainly hope so.
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?
What's this acting class guy's name?
Where?
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.
In case.
Now's a helluva time to play "what if".
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
What are we gonna see?
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
No. No, you don't.
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
A Norms in Van Nuys.
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
On their honeymoon.
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Where'd you come from?
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
Sure. No problem.
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
Suspect's words -
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
What's she doing?
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
July?!
Do you know what year it is?
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
"Never cry wolf!"
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.
Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!
James, why don't we...?
All I see are dead people.  Everywhere. What's three more?
Shot!  Who shot you?
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy.
Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.  I didn't say a word about "you know what".
JOSE!
Hey, man...
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
But you know what's real now?
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
You really want to know?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
Christ no!
Get me a Dr. Peppa!  I don't want no Pepsi.  Pepsi ain't nothing but flavored water.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
You want to make a kiddies bet?
That's my morning's pay.
But, in particular?
You own this place?
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
You son of a bitch!
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?
Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
Wrong number.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
You sure you can manage?
Accident.
You've been around.
Where you headed?
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
My face tell you all that?
Games?
Did you ever?
I don't know how.
I can't.
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
I don't know.
Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
John!?  What the hell's the matter with you?
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
John . . .?
You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?
Jesus, Grace.  Did you have to kill him?
He was going to--
Now what?
John!
Where the hell am I going to go?
And you're not one to lie, are you?
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
Husband . . .?
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
Now what can I do for you?
I need thirteen.
Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
What should I do?
I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?
All I have in the world.
It's not like that.
Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
You're not talking sense.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
I wasn't doing anything.
Now, what's this?
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
John, what a surprise.  I expected to be seeing you, not talking to you over the phone.
Kids.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
I didn't do anything.
Hey!  You there!
You want something?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
Maybe I do.
What?
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
Christ, I don't believe this!
Now, what's this?
Who the hell is this!?
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
What the fuck do you want?
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
I do.
You're talking like a madman.
Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
Shhh! Liar.
It's the truth, Jake.
Oz.
How old are you?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
That's right on my way.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
Where you coming from?
What happens when you lose?
Did you like it; me watching you?
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
A medicine man?
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
Still playing?
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
Did you ever?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
You'd never understand.
Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
Good thinking.  What's all this?
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
Time to go for a walk, Jake.
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
Whoa, what kind of accent you got there? You one of them Russians?
What's that?  ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?
Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can.
Is that the entire message?
Megan?
My turn. What's your favorite song?
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
What about the game?
I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
In college. A car accident.
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.
The guy might not have been carrying anything.
When?
He doesn't look very threatening.
Against a window.
In the passenger car?
Is this a religious thing?
I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
Rain's coming.
He didn't say nothin', huh?
I thought... you was an angel.
You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
Scouting?
Are you really going to kill them?
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
That much, huh?
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
What's your name?
Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?
Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...
No.
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
Better re-load it.
You missed him? You didn't...?
Yeah, he's in there.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
Two weeks, I guess.
Sally?
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
Naw. Naw, I don't ever go into town for that.  A man like me... A man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh.  Claudia, God rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all. 
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
Some fucker's shootin' at us.
What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
Hullo, paw.
That fella come by... Tom.
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
The Kid, yeah...
Did I what?
Depends what he told you.  About Bill, you mean?
They'll never stop.
So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
What are we gonna do?
Me too.
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
Keaton, I can't just -
Let's say for example -
Who's your boss?
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
A little of both.
Get a grip. I didn't know.
Who is he?
Someplace else, then.
The D.A. gave me immunity.
Kobayashi.
Why didn't you say anything?
Wait a minute.
Then why didn't you help him?
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
Gruber...
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
Yes!
Objection!
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?
What book is that?
I'm on the staff of...
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
You've just said you signed it.
What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
She getting good care over there?
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
I didn't do too well for you.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
I.  Yes.  It is.
Yes.
I appreciate--a man as busy as--
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much ...
Yes.
Her doctors killed her.
Do you know who her doctors were?
I didn't do it, Mister.
I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
...things change.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
How come you're calling me from...?
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
I'm a lawyer.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
What happened...?
Isn't there something you...
Is there going to be a later...?
You're pressuring yourself...
Hi, Mickey ...
I have to talk to you.
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Admittance form is wrong.
No.
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
So what?
Today is Tuesday.  What?
Yeah?  How's our new witness?
How are you holding up?
You use their witness.
The Doctors.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
...yeah...good...
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
She told me.
...of the procedures...
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
Should I?
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
How often does this happen?
Well?
Have you talked to the doctors at all?
Ernie's.
I -- I --
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!
You're not far wrong.
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
I want to know who you are.
Just dinner.
Tomorrow morning.
Yes.
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
But I like that one, Scottie.
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
Where shall we go for dinner?
We're going awfully far.
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
Scottie --
Yes!
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
Your accident...
Where had you been before?
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
You've nothing to apologize for.
No.
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
Do you know where you're going?
Long ago...
When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
How do you know?
I'm here, I've got you...
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you?
Let me go.
Let me go into the church alone.
Oh, yes!
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
More than you think.
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
Three whole weeks.
Sorry, old man. Work.
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
Johnny!
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
Is she pretty?
Yeah.
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
I don't know why the floor was wet!
What did you say?
The hell I don't.
About anybody but yourself. You never have.
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
What are you doing?
Just stop.
So I didn't fucking do it!
What does that mean?
Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
Who? What are you talking about?
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
They're driving me nuts!
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
If anything ever happens to me...
I want you to hear me out.
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
Nothing happened in Vegas.
That's right.
No I don't.
He just had two.
You said that Boyd.
We need padded chairs.
She's dead. Call somebody!
I'm calling the police.
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
Boyd...What have we done?
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
What?
Just do it.
I don't know...
Yeah.
Hear what?
Okay fine.
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
The hell I did!
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
Not true.
Then what do they have?
What?
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
Goosed!
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
What?
Why is this Kid staring at me?
Why?
You can't play around with these tent people.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
How do you figure?
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
He's a great chef.
That's absurd.
We've got problems here.
Hello.
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
Yeah. Sure.
Now?
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
Can we just talk this out?
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
Do you love me?
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
Who's dead?
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
But...
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
Just kills me...
It means she's insecure.
I just want her to be happy.
I don't care for him.
The wahoo moment?
Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
I have no idea.
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
A mutant species.
Take your time. I wish I had.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
How did you know about that?
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.
What will the lady say?
Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another trip?
Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
Is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? There must be something.
Forgive me if I have offended you.
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
It was very wellhidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late.
I've seen worse.
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
What's the assignment?
You embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
Of the six prison inmates you've tested  all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
I haven't been working on anything.
Do I get to see it or not?
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
It feels so.. .real.
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
... and you get nanodeath.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
What's wrong with Parker?
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
He was reenacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
Give me your wrist.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
What's the problem?
See something?
Where's John?
I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
What if he's busy tonight?
...on the way in.
It's the White House.
I don't think you're gonna need it.
And...she's not an Illegal Immigrant?  Is she?  Can I see her "chart?"  Because...
A small, "calico" kitten, sir.  "Calico." 
Hey, hey, I'm just the Producer, I'm just the <u>Stationmaster</u>, Johnny Green wrote that song, and...
Yeeaahhh...  Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
Three minutes.  It couldn't have been over three minutes, the Secret Service...
We are virtually certain it isn't...
What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks? 
<u>Do</u> it...
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.
Lookit, don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.
<u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
What did Albania ever do to us?
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...
Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
<u>Nashville</u>...?
...Stanley Moss...
...brazen-it-through...
No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>...
Courage, Mom.
... and he spent the last twelve years in a Milit&ry Prison... 
From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
OVER A SLEEPING BREAN, STRETCHED OUT ON A POOLCHAIR, GRACE, THE SECRETARY, COMES OUT ON TO THE POOL AREA, HOLDING THE SHOT OF A SMALL, FOREIGN LOOKING CHILD, IN FRONT OF A PILE OF RUBBLE. SHE SHOWS IT TO MOSS.
ON BREAN AND MOSS, WHO WALK SCHUMANN ACROSS THE HIGHWAY. IN THE B.G. WE SEE AMES TALKING TO THE DRIVER OF THE HARVESTER, WHO IS A SMALL, HISPANIC MAN.

I gotta get something, I gotta get ...shoes?  Ties? Hats...?  Good.  Good. 
Hello...?
But there isn't a B-2 bomber.
If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
...going to War...
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
King, King, I got a thing here, a product placement, gonna have a bigger back-end than Hattie McDaniel. Now:
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
What's the thing with Morse Code...
You do your job right, nobody should notice.
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
Medal.  Medal and Ribbon.
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
What the hell do <u>we</u> care?
Why not?
Some'b'y'll have you killed.
You would be, two, if you'd gone through what he went through.
Show Must Go On.
No, the deal <u>isn't</u> changed.  The Deal <u>isn't</u> changed. You can't ... what is it?  Money?  <u>Money</u>?  You want Money?
Hold it a minute, Benny, willya?
Look, look, look, look, Canada, okay...?  Our neighbor to the North, alla sudden, transformed, into That Place, where, like the North Wind, <u>Terror</u> comes...
...what do you got?
Going to make a little stop back home, pick up my shirts, show him a little treat.
Better.
John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi...
...they have the capacity to Meld into the <u>Woods</u>, and...
With their berets...
No, no, no.... we'll punch <u>in</u> a kitten.  Um... <u>Later</u>.
He's not dead, Ronnie.  He's just a little understandab1y, <u>fatigued</u>.  Let's get him to some help...
Grand Marnier.
Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.
...gotta read my reports.
What's going on?
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it.
That's great Dad.
What brings you out here...
Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it.
No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
Another cup of coffee?
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
...I can't even see it...
...come on sport, you gotta try harder, I need some exercise for chrissake...
Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out.
Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati. Men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers...
Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.
What makes you think you can?
You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
Oh yes, I remember you.
...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
What if I have a previous engagement?
You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.  Anacott Steel.
You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.
Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.
You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...
But?
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
Would you like a closer look?
Your books Master Loftmore
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
Jenkins!
Can I give her a message?
Tony and China?
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Oh that explains everything.
Sarah listen to me.
Mom.
They're all human beings
Stop saying things so loud!
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Then why did you?
Because he was worried about me.
Your husband?
Your friend saw them.
Do you?
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
That can't feel good.
Of course.  You must be so proud.
How're you holding up?
Who's that?
She isn't here.
When...when will she be back?
Um...sure.
You must think I'm pathetic.
What's your name?
What was her major?
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
I didn't sleep with him.
You should have heard her play.
Stop.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
Well good.  So you're human.
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
Know what I think?
What?
I have to go.
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
Okay.  Okay.
I was down in Adamant...
I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
If you have to work...
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
After that.
Claire?
Yep.
What?  No.  No.
What are you doing?
Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
How do you know this?
How did you--
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
Yep.
Oh God...
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
The leaves...
Adamant.
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
You don't have to do that.
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.
Thank you for this honor, my dear.
on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
He made that quite clear, yes.
Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.
I had you sent away.
I don't want the -
Better than most, I suppose.
She didn't feel them
Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -
Go back, MICHAEL... Go Back
uh - then he - be just -
Massive subdural hamatoma.  We have to evacuat it - right now.
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
To love, you must be able to feel.
A girl...?
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!
You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..
Harder...
Yessss...
They like you ------- kids.
HARDER!
All I meant was -
Stop it.
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
What about your work back home...?
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
Mm-hmmm...
Fall in New Orleans...  This whole town is waterlogged!  The matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin.
You really love this guy...?
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
The one on the left - definitely...
That's right...
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
I'm sorry?
My names isn't ANGELA...
Where do you kill them...
Tell me about your wife...
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
What's wrong?
What is it?
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
Why did you let him in?
I haven't been using it recently LESLIE
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
What happened?
You and your pep talks.
Were you always this sick?
That's crazy talk.
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
Cut it out, before you break something!
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
I thought I loved her.
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
Get them together.
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
You got everything you ever wanted.
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
The lesson being?
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
The one with the horses.
Well?
Very funny.
You want it in writing?
Me?
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
I guess.
Well? What do you think of her?
Wow...you clean up nice.
He didn't. He had it built.
Whatever.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
That's probably my office.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
What about you?
Do you trust me, Julie?
Not a chance.
You're quick. I like that.
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
I'm warning you.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
You called the cops on us?
Of course I like girls.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
Me? The King of Coitus?
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
My parents? What do you mean?
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
You okay?
Take your time.
I understand.
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
You could say that.
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
Ray, you heard him...
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
At that point were you able to fight him off?
I want a full-scale investigation.
What about witnesses?
Are you crazy, Ray?
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
I miss Dad.
From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood...
So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.
Good thinking.
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
Just like that?
Where is she?
Yes.
And she wanted to talk.
Yes.
Yeah, right.
What?
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
How...
Shit. Here we go again.
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
What way is that?
You might have mentioned you had that.
Can you fill me in here?
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
And people are actually fooled by that?
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
Really?
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
Your private train, sir.
Where'd he say he was going to do this?
I admire a man with a sense of humor.
No, sir... just a businessman.
Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
You're not that big.
Dr. Pemberton?
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
Now it's a bomb.
Hey...!
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
Why not?
You're a fool.  Now put her back.
Why did you say that?
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
Then you get us out of here.
You!!
Hey!  Give me that baby!
Where's the baby??
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
You must learn magic.
That's all I ever wanted!
What do I need for that?
Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
I just wanted to test it first.
Patience, Willow.
Who??
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal.
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
Tell you what  I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
What have you got?
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.
It's all over, Paul.
Now what's the problem?
Your sister said you don't have a family?
Does anybody know I'm here?
Only the elders.
Two days.
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
Tell him his tea stinks.
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
What else can you do?
Sure.
But... You may not be well enough.
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
Say again?
You'd lie to protect him.
Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
No? Why not?
That is idle talk.
Tight. But I'm working on him.
Get back in there.
Aunt Em!
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
If any!
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
Oh!
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
Did you say something?
...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
And bears!
Oh, he's just ascared again.
Oh! Something bit me, too!
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
Lions and tigers and bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
I'd sooner wait outside.
Oh, come on.
Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
I have so got brains.
...don't talk.
...free!
Um-hmm.
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
What?
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
Dear, whatever shall we do?
Oh, come on now - everybody -- 
The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
Here --   Come on.
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
Up!
Come on -- I've got another idea.
You humbug!
It's a whatzis.
You don't get around us that easy!
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
Beautiful!  What an echo!
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Hey, Dorothy!
Yes.
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
It's a whozis.
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
What the hell are you talking about?
Do you know what youre doing?
Then maybe Id be... open to that.
Beautiful, isnt it?
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
I met you at my fathers funeral.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
Does this look familiar to you?
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
The killer doesnt want to see this pipeline continue, doesnt want to see you take over...
Thats every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  Thats why youre here, isnt it? You think I cant do it. You think Im going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
I cant stay here.
No!  It will cave in!
I dont want to be safe!
Whats wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
One... last... screw?
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
Where?
What?
No! Bond!
Perhaps this isnt the time...
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if theyre coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
Someone will come.
Any word from him?
What?!
Walter --
Wrong answers?
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
I'm here, Laurie.
I could stay and go.
Collect me?
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
Jon --
Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
What??
What is it?  How does it work?
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
Dan -- what do we do now?
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
No comment.
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
Looks like a diner.
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
What's that?
You don't have to do that.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
Yorgi and Kirill.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
What...?
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
What does that mean?
I wish I could go.
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
For what purpose?
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
How?
Don't you knock?
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
And I'll never understand terrorists.
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
You have the wrong house.
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Yes, sir.
Carlson!
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
MMmmm.
Hello...?
Promise??
You're incorrigible!
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
What a strange fellow.
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
How long will this whole thing take?
What?
I didn't do that.
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
There.
What?
Did you hear that strange music??
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
If you like -- just hurry!
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
That sound good, boss.
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.
Good night, Doctor.
Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
Not fooling around.
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
Why don't we talk inside?
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
No, not sound.
How do you know they're done?
Three minutes to go!
Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.
Why don 't the Zulus attack?
Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of "The Standard", My Lord.
1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly?
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
Yes?
Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
