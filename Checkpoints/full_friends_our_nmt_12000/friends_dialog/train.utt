no ,  i know ,  but it &apos;s just so hard ,  you know ?  i mean ,  you &apos;re sitting there with her ,  she has no idea what &apos;s happening ,  and then you finally get up the courage to do it ,  and there &apos;s the horrible awkward moment when you &apos;ve handed her the note .  
why do you have to break up with her ?  be a man ,  just stop calling .

i just never had a relationship with that kind of passion ,  you know ,  where you have to have somebody right there ,  in the middle of a theme park .  
well ,  it was the only thing to do there that didn &apos;t have a line .  
there ,  well ,  see ?  barry wouldn &apos;t even kiss me on a miniature golf course .  
come on .  
no ,  he said we were holding up the people behind us .  
 and you didn &apos;t marry him because .  .  .  ?  
i mean ,  do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of .  .  .  
probably .  but you know ,  i &apos;ll tell you something .  passion is way overrated .  
yeah right .  
it is .  eventually ,  it kind of .  .  .  burns out .  but hopefully ,  what you &apos;re left with is trust ,  and security ,  and .  .  .  well ,  in the case of my ex - wife ,  lesbianism .  so ,  you know ,  for all of those people who miss out on that passion .  .  .  thing ,  there &apos;s all that other good stuff .  
 ok .  
but ,  um .  .  .  i don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to be you .  
you don &apos;t .

g &apos;bye ,  nana .

i just have to know ,  okay .  is it my hair ?  
 yes ,  chandler ,  that &apos;s exactly what it is .  it &apos;s your hair .  
yeah ,  you have homosexual hair .   
so ,  um ,  did she .  .  .  
twice .  
twice ?  
oh ,  that sucks !  
you guys okay ?  
i dunno ,  it &apos;s weird .  i mean ,  i know she &apos;s gone ,  but i just don &apos;t feel ,  uh .  .  .  
maybe that &apos;s  &apos;cause she &apos;s not really gone .  
nono ,  she &apos;s gone .  
we checked .  a lot .  
hm ,  i mean maybe no - one ever really goes .  ever since my mom died ,  every now and then ,  i get the feeling that she &apos;s like right here ,  y &apos;know ?   oh !  and debbie ,  my best friend from junior high -  got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course -  i always get this really strong debbie vibe whenever i use one of those little yellow pencils ,  y &apos;know ?   .  .  . i miss her .  
aw .  hey ,  pheebs ,  want this ?   
thanks !  
sure .  i just sharpened her this morning .

i thought it was gonna be a closed casket .  
well ,  that doesn &apos;t mean she can &apos;t look nice !   
sweetie ,  you think you can get in there ?

 .  .  . and then we throw your body in the water .  .  .  gee ,  that does sound fun .  
everyone thinks they know me .  everyone says  &apos;jack geller ,  so predictable &apos; .  maybe after i &apos;m gone ,  they &apos;ll say  &apos;buried at sea !  huh !  &apos; .

hey ,  gorgeous .  
 hey .  look ,  i &apos;m sorry about yesterday ,  i ,  um -

 pheebs ,  could you maybe hand me a cracker ?  
 your grandmother would have hated this .

no ,  i &apos;d be hearing about  &apos;why didn &apos;t i get the honey - glazed ham ?  &apos; ,  i didn &apos;t spend enough on flowers ,  and if i spent more she &apos;d be saying  &apos;why are you wasting your money ?  i don &apos;t need flowers ,  i &apos;m dead &apos; .  
that sounds like nana .  
do you know what it &apos;s like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say ?  
 .  .  . i can imagine .  
i &apos;m telling you ,  it &apos;s a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive ,  life - affirming person that she is .  
that is a wonder .  so tell me something ,  mom .  if you had to do it all over again ,  i mean ,  if she was here right now ,  would you tell her ?  
tell her what ?  
how she drove you crazy ,  picking on every little detail ,  like your hair .  .  .  for example .  
i &apos;m not sure i know what you &apos;re getting at .  
do you think things would have been better if you &apos;d just told her the truth ?  
 .  .  . no .  i think some things are better left unsaid .  i think it &apos;s nicer when people just get along .  
huh .  
more wine ,  dear ?  
oh ,  i think so .  
 those earrings look really lovely on you .  
thank you .  they &apos;re yours .

terry ,  i ,  i ,  i know that i haven &apos;t worked here very long ,  but i was wondering ,  do you think it would be possible if i got a $100 advance in my salary ?  
an advance ?  
it &apos;s so that i can spend thanksgiving with my family .  see ,  every year we go skiing in vail ,  and normally my father pays for my ticket ,  but i sort of started the whole independence thing ,  you know ,  which is actually why i took this job .  
rachel ,  rachel ,  sweetheart .  you &apos;re a terrible ,  terrible waitress .  really ,  really awful .  
excuse me ,  sir .  hi ,  you come in here all time .  i was just wondering ,  do you think there &apos;s a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips ?  
huh ?  
ok ,  ok ,  that &apos;s fine .  fine .  hey ,  i &apos;m sorry about that spill before .   only $98 . 50 to go .

oh ,  wow ,  so you &apos;re gonna be one of those  &quot; healthy ,  healthy ,  healthy guys &quot;  ?

so you &apos;re free thursday ,  then .  
yeah .  oh ,  can i come ?  
yeah .  rach ,  are you thinking you &apos;re gonna make it to vail ?  
absolutely .  shoop ,  shoop ,  shoop .  only a hundred and two dollars to go .  
i thought it was $98 . 50 .  
yeah ,  well it was .  i ,  i broke a cup .  
well ,  i &apos;m off to carol &apos;s .

thanks .  yeah ,  carol borrowed it for a class ,  and i have to get it back to the museum .  
what &apos;s it look like ?  
kinda like a big face without skin .  
yes ,  i &apos;m familiar with the concept .  we can just look for it .  
ok .   wow ,  you guys sure have a lot of books about bein &apos; a lesbian .  
well ,  you know ,  you have to take a course .  otherwise ,  they don &apos;t let you do it .  
 hey ,  hey ,  yertle the turtle .  a classic .  
actually ,  i &apos;m reading it to the baby .  
the uh ,  the baby that hasn &apos;t been born yet ?  wouldn &apos;t that mean you &apos;re .  .  .  crazy ?  
what ,  you don &apos;t think they can hear sounds in there ?  
you &apos;re not serious ,  i mean ,  you really .  .  .  you really talk to it ?  
yeah ,  all the time .  i want the baby to know my voice .  
do you uh ,  do you talk about me ?  
yeah ,  yeah ,  all the time .  
really ?  
look ,  if she &apos;s talking to it ,  i just think that i should get some belly time too .  not that i believe any of this .  
oh ,  i believe it .  i think the baby can totally hear everything .  i can show you .  look ,  this will seem a little weird ,  but you put your head inside this turkey ,  and then we &apos;ll all talk ,  and you &apos;ll hear everything we say .  
i &apos;d just like to say that i &apos;m totally behind this experiment .  in fact ,  i &apos;d very much like to butter your head .   
hey ,  rach ,  did you make your money ?  
no ,  not even close .  forget vail ,  forget seeing my family ,  forget shoop ,  shoop ,  shoop .  
rach ,  here &apos;s your mail .

mmm ,  looking good .  ok ,  cider &apos;s mulling ,  turkey &apos;s turking ,  yams are yamming .   what ?  
i don &apos;t know .  it &apos;s just not the same without mom in the kitchen .

look out ,  incoming pumpkin pie !  
ok ,  we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing ,  but that &apos;s not funny anymore .   
hey ,  monica ,  i got a question .  i don &apos;t see any tater tots .  
that &apos;s not a question .  
but my mom always makes them .  it &apos;s like a tradition .  you get a little piece of turkey on your fork ,  a little cranberry sauce ,  and a tot !  it &apos;s bad enough i can &apos;t be with my family because of my disease .  
all right ,  fine .  tonight &apos;s potatoes will be both mashed with lumps ,  and in the form of tots .  
ok ,  i &apos;m off to talk to my unborn child .

 ok ,  all done .  
what ,  phoebe ,  did you whip the potatoes ?  ross needs lumps !  
oh ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  oh ,  i just ,  i thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions .  
why would we do that ?  
well ,   &apos;cause then they &apos;d be like my mom used to make them ,  you know ,  before she died .  
ok ,  three kinds of potatoes coming up .  
ok ,  good - bye you guys .  thanks for everything .   oh ,  sorry !  oh ,  sorry !   
the most unbelievable thing has happened .  underdog has just gotten away .  
the balloon ?  
no ,  no ,  the actual cartoon character .  of course the balloon .  it &apos;s all over the news .  right before he reached macy &apos;s ,  he broke free and was spotted flying over washington square park .  i &apos;m goin &apos; to the roof ,  who &apos;s with me ?  
i can &apos;t ,  i gotta go .  
come on .  an 80 - foot inflatable dog let loose over the city .  how often does that happen ?

got the keys ?  or got the keys !  
anytime you &apos;re ready .  
ok ,  ok ,  here we go .   ok ,  where am i talking to ,  here ?  i mean ,  uh ,  well ,  there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage ,  but .  .  .  
just aim for the bump .  
ok ,  ok ,  ok ,  ok ,  here goes .  you know ,  i ,  you know ,  can &apos;t do this .  uh ,  this is too weird .  i feel stupid .  
so don &apos;t do it ,  it &apos;s fine .  you don &apos;t have to do it just because susan does it .  
i loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park .  
yeah ,  but did they have to shoot him down ?  i mean ,  that was just mean .  
ok ,  right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside ,  juicy on the inside .  why are we standing here ?  
we &apos;re waiting for you to open the door .  you got the keys .  
no i don &apos;t .  
yes ,  you do .  when we left ,  you said ,   &quot; got the keys .  &quot;  
no i didn &apos;t .  i asked ,   &quot; got the ke - eys ?  &quot;

 the oven is on .  
oh ,  i gotta get my ticket !  
wait ,  wait ,  we have a copy of your key .  
well then get it ,  get it !  
that tone will not make me go any faster .

can you go any faster with that ?  
hey ,  i got one keyhole and about a zillion keys .  you do the math .  
why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway ?  
 for an emergency just like this .

i swear you said you had the keys .  
no ,  i didn &apos;t .  i wouldn &apos;t say i had the keys unless i had the keys ,  and i obviously didn &apos;t have the keys .  
ooh ,  ok ,  that &apos;s it .  enough with the keys .  no one say keys .   
why would i have the keys ?  
aside from the fact that you said you had them ?  
but i didn &apos;t .  
well ,  you should have .  
why ?  
because !  
why ?  
because !  
why ?  because everything is my responsibility ?  isn &apos;t it enough that i &apos;m making thanksgiving dinner for everyone ?  you know ,  everyone wants a different kind of potatoes ,  so i &apos;m making different kinds of potatoes .  does anybody care what kind of potatoes i want ?  nooooo ,  no ,  no !   just as long as phoebe gets her peas and onions ,  and mario gets his tots ,  and it &apos;s my first thanksgiving ,  and it &apos;s all burned ,  and ,  and i .  .  .  i .  .  .

i &apos;d like to propose a toast .  little toast here ,  ding ding .  i know this isn &apos;t the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned ,  but for me ,  this has been really great ,  you know ,  i think because it didn &apos;t involve divorce or projectile vomiting .  anyway ,  i was just thinking ,  i mean ,  if you &apos;d gone to vail ,  and if you guys &apos;d been with your family ,  if you didn &apos;t have syphilis and stuff ,  we wouldn &apos;t be all together ,  you know ?  so i guess what i &apos;m trying to say is that i &apos;m very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked .

no .  no ,  that &apos;s -  that &apos;s okay .  
well ,  c &apos;mon ,  if it &apos;s important enough to discuss while i &apos;m playing ,  then i assume it &apos;s important enough for everyone else to hear !  
 that guy &apos;s going home with a note !  
noth -  i was -  i was just saying to my -  
could you speak up please ?  
 sorry ,  i wa -  i was just saying to my friend that i thought you were the most beautiful woman that i &apos;d ever seen in my -  in my life .  and then he said that -  you said you thought 
daryl hannah .  
daryl hannah was the most beautiful woman that he &apos;d ever seen in his life and i said yeah ,  i liked her in splash ,  a lot ,  but not so much in -  in wall street ,  i thought she had kind of a 
hard quality .  
 - hard quality .  and uh ,  while daryl hannah is beautiful in a conventional way ,  you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace .  then ,  uh ,  that - that - that &apos;s when you started yelling .   
okay ,  we &apos;re gonna take a short break .   
come here ,  marcel .  sit here .   
pheebs ,  i can &apos;t believe he hasn &apos;t kissed you yet .  i mean god ,  by my sixth date with paolo ,  i mean he had already named both my breasts !   .  .  . ooh .  did i just share too much ?  
just a smidge .  
david &apos;s like ,  y &apos;know ,  scientist guy .  he &apos;s very methodical .  
i think it &apos;s romantic .  
me too !  oh !  did you ever see an officer and a gentleman ?  
yeah !  
well ,  he &apos;s kinda like the guy i went to see that with .  except ,  except he - he &apos;s smarter ,  and gentler ,  and sweeter .  .  .  i just -  i just wanna be with him all the time .  day and night ,  and night and day .  .  .  and special occasions .  .  .  
wait a minute ,  wait a minute ,  i see where this is going ,  you &apos;re gonna ask him to new year &apos;s ,  aren &apos;t you .  you &apos;re gonna break the pact .  she &apos;s gonna break the pact .  
no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no .  yeah ,  could i just ?  
yeah ,   &apos;cause i already asked janice .  
what ?  !  
c &apos;mon ,  this was a pact !  this was your pact !  
i snapped ,  okay ?  i couldn &apos;t handle the pressure and i snapped .  
yeah ,  but janice ?  that - that was like the worst breakup in history !  
i &apos;m not saying it was a good idea ,  i &apos;m saying i snapped !   
hi .  hi ,  sorry i &apos;m late .   
too many jokes .  .  .  must mock joey !  
nice shoes ,  huh ?   
aah ,  y &apos;killing me !   
ross !  he &apos;s playing with my spatulas again !  
okay ,  look ,  he &apos;s not gonna hurt them ,  right ?  
do you always have to bring him here ?  
i didn &apos;t wanna leave him alone .  alright ?  we -  we had our first fight this morning .  i think it has to do with my working late .  i said some things that i didn &apos;t mean ,  and he -  he threw some faeces .  .  .  
y &apos;know ,  if you &apos;re gonna work late ,  i could look in on him for you .  
oh ,  that &apos;d be great !  okay ,  but if you do ,  make sure it seems like you &apos;re there to see him ,  okay ,  and you &apos;re not like doing it as a favour to me .  
 .  .  . but ,  you can &apos;t actually test this theory ,  because today &apos;s particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions .  
okay ,  alright ,  i have a question ,  then .  
yuh .  
um ,  were you planning on kissing me ever ?  
uh ,  that &apos;s definitely a ,  uh ,  valid question .  and ,  uh ,  the answer would be  yes .  yes i was .  but ,  see ,  i wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment ,  because ,  well ,   &apos;cause it &apos;s you .  
sure .  
right .  but ,  see ,  the longer i waited ,  the more phenomenal the kiss had to be ,  and now we &apos;ve reached a place where it &apos;s just gotta be one of those things where i just like .  .  .  sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it .  and ,  uh ,  i &apos;m not really a ,  uh ,  sweeping sorta fella .  
oh ,  david ,  i ,  i think you are a sweeping sorta fella .  i mean ,  you &apos;re a sweeper !   .  .  . trapped inside a physicist &apos;s body .  
rrrreally .  
oh ,  yeah ,  oh ,  i &apos;m sure of it .  you should just do it ,  just sweep and throw me .  
 .  .  . now ?  now ?  
oh yeah ,  right now .  
okay ,  okay ,  okay .   y &apos;know what ,  this was just really expensive .   and i &apos;ll take -  this was a gift .   
okay ,  now you &apos;re just kinda tidying .  
okay ,  what the hell ,  what the hell .   you want me to actually throw you or you - you wanna just hop ?

it was an accident .  not like i was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts .  
okay ,  okay ,  could we change the subject ,  please ?  
yeah ,   &apos;cause hello ,  these are not her boobies ,  these are her breasts .  
okay ,  pheebs ,  i was hoping for more of a change .  
y &apos;know ,  i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re so embarrassed ,  they were very nice boobies .  
nice ?  they were nice .  i mean ,  that &apos;s it ?  i mean ,  mittens are nice .  
okaaay ,   rock ,  hard place ,  me .  
you &apos;re so funny !  he &apos;s really funny !  i wouldn &apos;t wanna be there when when the laughter stops .  
whoah whoah ,  back up there ,  sparky .  what &apos;d you mean by that ?  
oh ,  just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues .  y &apos;know ,  that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance .  
huh .  
i mean hey !  i just met you ,  i don &apos;t know you from adam .   .  .  . only child ,  right ?  parents divorced before you hit puberty .  
uhhuh ,  how did you know that ?  
it &apos;s textbook .   
hey you guys .  hey ,  you all know my dad ,  right ?  
hey !  hey ,  mr .  trib !  
hey ,  how long are you in the city ?  
just for a coupla days .  i got a job midtown .  i figure i &apos;m better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry .   i don &apos;t know this one .  
oh ,  this is my friend roger .  
hi .  
hey ,  hey .  good to meet you ,  roger .  
you too ,  sir .  
 what happened to the ,  uh ,  puppet guy ?  
dad ,  dad .   
gotta go .  i miss you too ,  i love you ,  but it &apos;s getting real late now 
 hey ma .  listen ,  i made the appointment with dr .  bazida ,  and .  .  .  excuse me ?   did you know this isn &apos;t ma ?   
her name &apos;s ronni .  she &apos;s a pet mortician .  
sure .  so how long you been .  .  .   
remember when you were a little kid ,  i used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships ?  
since then ?  !  
no ,  it &apos;s only been six years .  i just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you &apos;d know that i wasn &apos;t always such a terrible guy .   .  .  . joe .  y &apos;ever been in love ?  
 .  .  . i d &apos;know .  
then y &apos;haven &apos;t .  you &apos;re burning your tomatoes .  
you &apos;re one to talk .   
joe ,  your dad &apos;s in love big time .  and the worst part of it is ,  it &apos;s with two different women .  
oh man .  please tell me one of  &apos;em is ma .  
it &apos;s like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life .  he &apos;s like actually some spy ,  working for the c . i . a .   that &apos;d be cool .  .  .  .  this blows !  
i know ,  i mean ,  why can &apos;t parents just stay parents ?   why do they have to become people ?  why do they have .  .  .   why can &apos;t you stop staring at my breasts ?  
 what ?   what ?  
did you not get a good enough look the other day ?  
alright ,  alright .  we &apos;re all adults here ,  there &apos;s only one way to resolve this .  since you saw her boobies ,  i think ,  uh ,  you &apos;re gonna have to show her your peepee .  
y &apos;know ,  i don &apos;t see that happening ?  
c &apos;mon ,  he &apos;s right .  tit for tat .  
well i &apos;m not showing you my  &apos;tat .  &apos;  
hello ?  
 it &apos;s phoebe .  
 and rog .  
c &apos;mon up .  
 oh ,  good .  rog is here .  
what &apos;s the matter with rog ?  
yeah .  
oh ,  it &apos;s nothing ,  it &apos;s a little thing .  .  .  i hate that guy .  
what ,  so he was a little analytical .  that &apos;s what he does ,  y &apos;know ?  c &apos;mon ,  he &apos;s not that bad .   
y &apos;see ,  that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong .  why would i marry her if i thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian ?  
i dunno .  maybe you wanted your marriage to fail .  
why ?  why would i why ?  why ?  why ?  why ?  
i don &apos;t know .  maybe maybe low self - esteem ,  maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling ,  maybe you .  .  .  
wait - wait ,  go back to that sibling thing .  
well ,  i don &apos;t know .  i mean ,  it &apos;s conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents .  
that that &apos;s ridiculous !  i don &apos;t feel guilty for her failures !  
oh !  so you think i &apos;m a failure !  
isn &apos;t he good ?  
nonono ,  thatthat &apos;s not what i was saying .  .  .  
y &apos;know ,  all these years ,  i thought you were on my side .  but maybe what you were doing was sucking up to mom and dad so they &apos;d keep liking you better !  
hey ,  i married a lesbian to make you look good !   
you &apos;re right !  i mean you &apos;re right !  it wasn &apos;t just the weebles ,  but it was the weeble play palace ,  and and the weebles &apos; cruise ship .  oh ,  which had this little lifeboat for the weebles to wobble in .  
that &apos;s tough .  tough stuff .  c &apos;mon ,  pheebs ,  we &apos;re gonna catch that movie ,  we gotta get going .  
oh ,  okay .  feel better ,  rachel ,   &apos;kay ?

now ,  y &apos;see ,  most people ,  when their pets pass on ,  they want  &apos;em sorta laid out like they &apos;re sleeping .  but occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose .  like ,  chasing their tail ,   or ,  uh ,  jumping to catch a frisbee .  
joey ,  if i go first ,  i wanna be looking for my keys .  
that &apos;s a good one !

are they end to end ,  or tall like pancakes ?  
y &apos;know what i mean ,  about how i &apos;m always going out with all these women .  and i always figured ,  when the right one comes along ,  i &apos;d be able to be a stand - up guy and go the distance ,  y &apos;know ?  now i &apos;m looking at my dad ,  thinking .  .  .  
hey ,  you &apos;re not him .  you &apos;re you .  when they were all over you to go into your father &apos;s pipe - fitting business ,  did you cave ?  
no .  
no .  you decided to go into the out - of - work actor business .  now that wasn &apos;t easy ,  but you did it !  and i &apos;d like to believe that when the right woman comes along ,  you will have the courage and the guts to say  &quot; no thanks ,  i &apos;m married .  &quot;  
you really think so ?  
yeah .  i really do .  
thanks ,  chandler .

we &apos;re sorry ,  pheebs ,  we &apos;re sorry .

ma ,  i don &apos;t mean to be disrespectful ,  but .  .  .  what the hell are you talking about ?  !  i mean ,  what about you ?  and your father would look like sting .  and i &apos;ll tell you something else .  ever since that poodle - stuffer came along ,  he &apos;s been so ashamed of himself that he &apos;s been more attentive ,  he &apos;s been more loving .  .  .  i mean ,  it &apos;s like every day &apos;s our anniversary .  
i &apos;m .  .  . happy .  .  . for you ?  it the way it was .  
ma ,  i &apos;m sorry .  i just did what i thought you &apos;d want .  see her ?

oh .  they don &apos;t .  
but they don &apos;t see all the wonderfulness that i see .  they don &apos;t see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff .  they just think you &apos;re a little .  .  .  
what ?  
intense and creepy .  
oh .  
but i don &apos;t .  me ,  phoebe .  
well ,  i &apos;m not i &apos;m not at all surprised they feel that way .  
you &apos;re not ?  see ,  that &apos;s why you &apos;re so great !  
so you talked to your dad ,  huh .  
yeah .  he &apos;s gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted ,  she &apos;s gonna keep pretending she doesn &apos;t know even though she does ,  and my little sister tina can &apos;t see her husband any more because he got a restraining order .  .  . which has nothing to do with anything except that i found out today .  
wow .  
things sure have changed here on waltons mountain .  
so joey ,  you okay ?  
yeah ,  i guess .  it &apos;s just parents ,  after a certain point ,  you gotta let go .  even if you know better ,  you &apos;ve gotta let them make their own mistakes .  
just think ,  in a couple of years we get to turn into them .  
if i turn into my parents ,  i &apos;ll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty - year - old boys ,  or .  .  .  i &apos;ll end up like my mom .  
 hey .

oh ,  uh ,  listen ,  about tonight .  .  .  
no ,  no ,  no ,  don &apos;t you dare bail on me .  the only reason she &apos;s goin &apos; out with me is because i said i could bring a friend for her friend .  
yes ,  i know ,  but her friend sounds like such a .  .  .  
pathetic mess ?  i know ,  butcome on ,  man ,  she &apos;s needy ,  she &apos;s vulnerable .  i &apos;m thinkin &apos; ,  cha - ching !   thanks .  look ,  you have not been out with a woman since janice .  you &apos;re doin &apos; this .

 can you stop yellin &apos; ?  you &apos;re makin &apos; me nervous ,  and i can &apos;t go when i &apos;m nervous .  
ok ,  ok ,  roger was creepy ,  but he was nothing compared to pete carney .  
which one was pete carney ?  
pete the weeper ?  remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex .    &quot; was it good for you ?  &quot;  
yeah ,  well ,  i &apos;ll take a little crying any day over howard - the -  &quot; i - win &quot;  - guy .    &quot; i win !  i win !  &quot;  i went out with the guy for two monthsi didn &apos;t get to win once .  
how did we end up with these jerks ?  we &apos;re good people !  
i don &apos;t know .  maybe we &apos;re some kinda magnets .  
i know i am .  that &apos;s why i can &apos;t wear a digital watch .  
there &apos;s more beer ,  right ?  
oh !  you know my friend abby who shaves her head ?  she said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle ,  you can do like a cleansing ritual .  
pheebes ,  this woman is voluntarily bald .  
yeah .  so ,  we can do it tomorrow night ,  you guys .  it &apos;s valentine &apos;s day .  it &apos;s perfect .  
ok ,  well ,  what kind of ritual ?  
ok .  we can ,  um ,  we can burn the stuff they gave us .  
or ?  
or .  .  . or we can chant and dance around naked ,  you know ,  with sticks .  
burning &apos;s good .  
you know ,  ever since i was little ,  i &apos;ve been able to pick up quarters with my toes .  
good for you .   uh ,  quarters or rolls of quarters ?  
by the way ,  chandler .  i cut you out of all my pictures .  so if you want ,  i have a bag with just your heads .  
that &apos;s ok .  
oh ,  are you sure ?  really ?  because you know ,  you could make little puppets out of them ,  and you could use them in your theater of cruelty .   
 we can &apos;t do that .  
 what ?  what can &apos;t you do ?  
uh ,  can i talk to you for a second ,  over there ?   
uh ,  we might be leaving now .  
tell me it &apos;s  &quot; you and me &quot;  we .  
she said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off .  i &apos;m not even sure what slathering is ,  but i definitely want to be a part of it .  
ok ,  you can not do this to me .  
you &apos;re right ,  i &apos;m sorry .  you &apos;re right .  
 uh ,  can we have three chocolate mousses to go please ?

excuse me .   how ya doin &apos; ?  
so ,  do we have the best friends or what ?

i &apos;m just sayin &apos; if dogs do experience jet lag ,  then ,  because of the whole um ,  seven dog years to one human year thing ,  then ,  when a dog flies from new york to los angeles ,  he doesn &apos;t just lose three hours ,  he loses like a week and a half .   
that &apos;s funny .  who are they ?  
the blond woman is my ex - wife ,  and the woman touching her is her .  .  .  close ,  personal friend .  
you mean they &apos;re lovers .  
if you wanna put a label on it .  
wow ,  uh ,  anything else i should know ?  
nope ,  nope ,  that &apos;s it .   
ok ,  so now we need ,  um sage branches and the sacramental wine .  
all i have is ,  is oregano and a fresca .  
um ,  that &apos;s ok !   ok .  all right .  now we need the semen of a righteous man .  
ok ,  pheebs ,  you know what ,  if we had that ,  we wouldn &apos;t be doing the ritual in the first place .  
can we just start throwing things in ?  
ok ,  yeah ,  ok .   oh ,  ok .

rachel .  
barry ?  !  
i can &apos;t .  i can &apos;t do it ,  i can &apos;t marry mindy .  i think i &apos;m still in love with you .

eh .  i thought that was an alp .  
well ,  high school was not my favourite time .  
i dunno ,  i loved high school .  y &apos;know ?  it was just four years of parties and dating and sex .  
yeah ,  well i went to boarding school with four hundred boys .  any sex i had would &apos;ve involved a major lifestyle choice .  
gosh ,  doesn &apos;t it seem like a million years ago ?  
i can &apos;t believe you would actually say that .  i would much rather be mr . peanut than mr . salty .  
no way !  mr . salty is a sailor ,  all right ,  he &apos;s got to be ,  like ,  thetoughest snack there is .  
i don &apos;t know ,  you don &apos;t wanna mess with corn nuts .  they &apos;re craaazy .  
 oh my god .  you guys !  you gotta come see this !  there &apos;s some creep out there with a telescope !  
i can &apos;t believe it !  he &apos;s looking right at us !  
oh ,  that is so sick .  
i feel violated .  and not in a good way .  
i am telling you ,  years from now ,  schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time .  it was unbelievable !  we could totally be ourselves ,  we didn &apos;t have to play any games .  .  .  
so have you called her yet ?  
let her know i like her ?  what are you ,  insane ?   it &apos;s the next day !  how needy do i want to seem ?   i &apos;m right ,  right ?  
i can &apos;t believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people .  
oh ,  god ,  just do it !   call her !  stop being so testosteroney !  
which ,  by the way ,  is the real san francisco treat .   i got her machine .

no ,  interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up .  
so ,  uh ,  why didn &apos;t you say anything ?  
oh ,  no - no - no - no .  last time i left a spontaneous message i ended up using the phrase  &quot; yes indeedy - o .  &quot;  
look look !  it &apos;s rachel and barry .  no ,  don &apos;t everybody look at once !  
okay ,  okay ,  what &apos;s going on ?

yeah ,  well ,  does he look upset ?  does he look like he was just told to shove anything ?  
no ,  no actually ,  he &apos;s smiling .  .  and .  .  .  oh my god ,  don &apos;t do that !  !  
what ?  what ?  what ?  !  
that man across the street just kicked that pigeon !   oh !  
 and basically ,  that &apos;s how a bill becomes a law .  
oh !  .  .  .  right !  
hey rach !  
how &apos;d it go ?  
y &apos;know ,  it was ,  uh .  .  it was actually really great .  he took me to lunch at the russian tea room ,  and i had that chicken ,  where y &apos;know you poke it and all the butter squirts out .  .  .  
not a good day for birds .  .  .  
then we took a walk down to bendall &apos;s ,  and i told him not to ,  but he got me a little bottle of chanel .  .  .  
that &apos;s nice .  .  .  now ,  was that before or after you told him to stop calling ,  stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone ,  hmm ?  
right ,  .  .  well ,  .  .  we never actually got to that .  .  .  oh ,  it was just so nice to see him again ,  y &apos;know ?  it was comfortable ,  it was familiar .  .  .  it was just nice !  
that &apos;s ,  that &apos;s nice twice !  
rachel ,  what &apos;s going on ?  i mean isn &apos;t this the same barry who you left at the altar ?  
duh ,  where &apos;ve you been ?  
yeah ,  but it was different with him today !  and he wasn &apos;t ,  like ,  orthodontist guy ,  y &apos;know ?  i mean ,  we had fun !  is there anything wrong with that ?   
yes !  
why ?  
i have my reasons .  
okay ,  how about the fact that he &apos;s engaged to another woman ,  who just happens to be your ex - best friend ?  
wow .  .  .  wow !  
yeah .  
i &apos;m not crazy ,  right ?  i mean ,  it was never like that .

 look look !  he &apos;s doing it again ,  the guy with the telescope !  
oh my god !   go away !   stop looking in here !  
great ,  now he &apos;s waving back .  
man ,  we gotta do something about that guy .  this morning ,  i caught him looking into our apartment .  it creeps me out !  i feel like i can &apos;t do stuff !

you cook naked ?  
yeah ,  toast ,  oatmeal .  .  .  nothing that spatters .   
what &apos;s the matter ?  
oh ,  it &apos;s just .  .  .  oh ,  barry ,  this was not good .

yeah .  .  uh ,  but for future reference ,  that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone .   
yes ,  it &apos;s working !  why isn &apos;t she calling me back ?  
maybe she never got your message .  
y &apos;know ,  if you want ,  you can call her machine ,  and if she has a lot of beeps ,  that means she probably didn &apos;t get her messages yet .  
y &apos;don &apos;t think that makes me seem a little .  .  .  
 .  .  . desperate ,  needy ,  pathetic ?  
ah ,  you obviously saw my personal ad .   
how many beeps ?  
she answered .  
y &apos;see ,  this is where you &apos;d use that  &apos;hello &apos; word we talked about .  
i &apos;m not gonna talk to her ,  she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me .  now i &apos;m needy and snubbed .  god ,  i miss just being needy .

monica ,  would you calm down ?  the credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought .  
i know .  it &apos;s just such reckless spending .  
i think when someone steals your credit card ,  they &apos;ve kind of already thrown caution to the wind .  
wow ,  what a geek .  they spent $69 . 95 on a wonder mop .  
that &apos;s me .  
oh !  the yuk !  ross ,  he &apos;s doing it again !

um ,  pennsylvania dutch .  
 hi .  
where &apos;ve you been ?  
at the vet .  
she &apos;s not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones ,  is she ?  
she says marcel &apos;s humping thing &apos;s not a phase .  apparently he &apos;s reached sexual maturity .  
 hey !  he beat ya .  
she says as time goes on ,  he &apos;s gonna start getting agressive and violent .  
so what does this mean ?  
i can &apos;t believe it ,  ross .  this sucks !  
i don &apos;t get it ,  i mean ,  you just got him .  how can he be an adult already ?  
i know .  i know .  i mean ,  one day ,  he &apos;s this little thing ,  and before you know it ,  he &apos;s this little thing i can &apos;t get off my leg .  
isn &apos;t there any way you can keep him ?  
no ,  no .  the vet says unless he &apos;s in a place where he has regular access to some .  .  .  monkey lovin ,  &apos; he &apos;s just gonna get vicious .  i &apos;ve just gotta get him into a zoo .  
how do you get a monkey into a zoo ?  
i know that one !   .  .  . no ,  that &apos;s popes into a volkswagen .  
well ,  we &apos;re applying to a lot of them .  naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos ,  y &apos;know ,  like ,  uh ,  san diego .  .  .  right ?  but that might just be a pipe dream ,  because ,  y &apos;know ,  he &apos;s out of state .  uh ,  my vet ,  uh ,  knows someone at miami ,  so that &apos;s a possibility .  
yeah ,  but that &apos;s like two blocks away from the beach .  i mean ,  it &apos;s a total party zoo .   
hey .  we found her ,  we found the girl .  
what ?  
did you call the cops ?  
nope .  we took her to lunch .  
ah .  your own brand of vigilante justice .  
what ?  !  are you insane ?  this woman stole from you .  she stole .  she &apos;s a stealer .  
y &apos;know what ?  after you &apos;re with this woman for like ten minutes ,  you forget all that .  i mean ,  she is this astounding person ,  with this ,  with this amazing spirit .  
yeah ,  which she probably stole from some cheerleader .  
 .  .  . take off their hats !  
no way .  no way did you do this .  
it was so wild .  we told them we were the gunnersens in room six fifteen .  only to find out the boston celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor !  have breasts .  .  .  
 .  .  . they threw us out !  i was thrown out of a hotel !  me !  
go monana !  well ,  you ladies are not the only ones living the dream .  i get to go pour coffee for people i don &apos;t know .  don &apos;t wait up .   
 &apos;scuse me ?  memories and make complete fools of ourselves .  whaddya say ?  
nononononono .  think who you &apos;re dealing with here .  i mean ,  i &apos;m not like you .  i - i can &apos;t even stand in front of a tap class .  
what ?  
right .  till i bought a blow dryer ,  then i was shunned .  changed my life .  did you ever see dead poets &apos; society ?  
uh - huh .  i mean ,  that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can &apos;t be in the play ?  what was that ?  !  it &apos;s like ,  kid ,  wait a year ,  leave home ,  do some community theatre .  i walked out of there and i thought ,   &apos;now ,  that &apos;s two hours of my life that i &apos;m never getting back .  &apos; and that thought scared me more than all the other crap i was afraid to do .  
 oh god .   we didn &apos;t get into scranton .   that was like our safety zoo .  they take like dogs and cows .  see ?  i don &apos;t know who this is harder on ,  me or him .

who &apos;s this from ?  
oh ,  that &apos;s ross &apos;s .  
oh .  .  .   .  .  .   oh my god .  he remembered .  
remembered what ?  
it was like months ago .  we were walking by this antique store ,  and i saw this pin in the window ,  and i told him it was just like one my grandmother had when i was a little girl .  oh !  i can &apos;t believe he remembered !  
well ,  sure ,  but can you play it on a plane ?   
oh ,  it &apos;s so pretty .  this must have cost him a fortune .  
i can &apos;t believe he did this .  
come on ,  ross ?  remember back in college ,  when he fell in love with carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck ?   
what did you just say ?  
 ahem .  .  .  um .  .  .  crystal duck .

ok ,  is there a mute button on this woman ?  
i think this is so great !  i mean ,  you and ross !  d - did you have any idea ?  
no !  none !  i mean ,  my first night in the city ,  he mentioned something did he say ?  i mean ,  does he ,  like ,  want to go out with me ?  
well ,  given that he &apos;s desperately in love with you ,  he probably wouldn &apos;t mind getting a cup of coffee or something .  
ross ?  all this time ?  well ,  i &apos;ve got to talk to him .   
 h - he &apos;s in china !  
the country .  
no ,  no ,  wait .   his flight doesn &apos;t leave for another forty - five more minutes .  
what about the time difference ?  
from here to the airport ?  
yes !   you &apos;re never gonna make it !  
rachel ,  what &apos;re you gonna say to him ?  
i - i - i don &apos;t know .  
well then maybe you shouldn &apos;t go .  
he &apos;s right ,  cause if you &apos;re just gonna ,  like ,  break his heart ,  that &apos;s the kind of thing that can wait .  
yeah ,  but if it &apos;s good news ,  you should tell him now .  
i don &apos;t know .  maybe i &apos;ll know when i see him .

uh ,  so ,  uh ,  rach ,  uh .  .  .  do you wanna save this wrapping paper ,  i mean ,  it &apos;s only a little bit torn .  .  .  so are you gonna go for it with ross or should i just throw it out ?  
i don &apos;t know .  i don &apos;t know .  .  .  i thought about it all the way there ,  and i thought about it all the way back .  .  .  and ,  uh ,  oh ,  you guys ,  y &apos;know ,  it &apos;s ross .  y &apos;know what i mean ?  i mean ,  it &apos;s ross .  
i don &apos;t know ,  i mean ,  this is just my initial gut feeling .  .  .  but i &apos;m thinking .  .  .  oh ,  i &apos;m thinking it &apos;d be really great .  
oh my god ,  me too !  oh !  oh ,  we &apos;d be like friends - in - law !  y &apos;know what the best part is ?  the best part is that you already know everything about him !  i mean ,  it &apos;s like starting on the fifteenth date !  
yeah ,  but ,  y &apos;know ,  it &apos;s .  .  .  it would be like starting on the fifteenth date .  
another good point .  
no ,  i mean ,  i mean ,  when you &apos;re at the fifteenth date ,  y &apos;know ,  you &apos;re already in a very relationshippy place .  y &apos;know ,  it &apos;s .  .  .  you &apos;re committed .  
 huh ?  
well ,  i mean ,  then what happens if it doesn &apos;t work out ?  
why isn &apos;t it working out ?  
i don &apos;t know .  .  .  sometimes it doesn &apos;t .  
is he not cute enough for you ?  
no !  
does he not make enough money ?  
no ,  i &apos;m just .  .  .  .  
maybe there &apos;s someone else .  
wha .  .  .  
is there ?  is there someone else ?  
no !  there is .  .  there is noone else !  
hey ,  big .  .  .  
shhhh !  
  .  .  . spender .  
she &apos;s still asleep .  
so how &apos;d it go ?  
oh ,  it was amazing .  you know how you always think you &apos;re great in bed ?  
the fact that you &apos;d even ask that question shows how little you know me .  
well ,  it &apos;s like ,  last night ,  i couldn &apos;t do the thing that usually makes me great .  so i had to do all this other stuff .  and the response i got .  .  .  man ,  oh man ,  it was like a ticker tape parade !  
yes ,  i know ,  as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route .  
it was amazing !  and not just for her .  .  .  uh - uh .  for me ,  too .  it &apos;s like ,  all of a sudden ,  i &apos;m blind .  but all my other senses are heightened ,  y &apos;know ?  it &apos;s like .  .  .  i was able to appreciate it on another level .  
i didn &apos;t know you had another level .  
hey ,  great skirt !  birthday present ?  
yeah .  
oh ,  from who ?  
from you .  i exchanged the blouse you got me .  
well ,  it &apos;s the thought .  hey ,  doesn &apos;t ross &apos;s flight get in in a couple hours ?  at gate 27 - b ?  
uh ,  yeah .  uh ,  monica ,  y &apos;know ,  honey ,  i &apos;ve been thinking about it and i &apos;ve decided thisthis whole ross thing ,  it &apos;s just not a good idea .  
oh ,  why ?  
because ,  i feel like i wouldn &apos;t just be going out with him .  i would be going out with all of you .  oh ,  and there would just be all this pressure ,  and i don &apos;t wanna .  .  .  
 no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no pressure ,  no pressure !  
monica ,  nothing has even happened yet ,  and you &apos;re already so .  .  .  
i am not  &apos;so &apos; !  ok ,  i was a teensy bit weird at first ,  but .  .  .  i &apos;ll be good .  i promise .   
who is it ?  
it &apos;s me ,  carl .  
c &apos;mon up .  
seven hundred bucks !  
alright ,  you did it !  do we have any fruit ?  
man ,  hell of a two weeks ,  huh ?  y &apos;know what ,  though ?  i really feel like i learned something .  
really ?  so ,  you &apos;re gonna stick with this  &apos;it &apos;s all for her &apos; thing ?  
i &apos;m just sayin &apos; ,  if i see one more picture of ed begley ,  jr .  in that stupid electric car ,  i &apos;m gonna shoot myself !  i mean ,  don &apos;t get me wrong .  .  .  i &apos;m not against environmental issues per se .  .  .  .  it &apos;s just that guy !   
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;d rather go out with him than me .  
would you excuse me ,  please ?  i &apos;m trying to have a date here .  
fine ,  just stop thinking about me .   
can &apos;t do it ,  can you ?  
so i &apos;m thinking about you .  so what ?  
i don &apos;t get it .  what do you see in this guy ,  anyway ?  
well .  .  .  he happens to be a very nice .  .  .  guy .  .  .  .  
i mean ,  come on ,  buddy ,  get a real car !  
rachel ,  come on .  give us a chance .  
ross ,  it &apos;s too hard .  
no ,  no ,  no .  .  .  why ,  because it might get weird for everyone else ?  who cares about them .  this is about us .  look ,  i - i &apos;ve been in love with you since ,  like ,  the ninth grade .  
ross ,  you &apos;re like my best friend .  
i know .  
if we broke up ,  and i lost you .  .  .  
whoa ,  whoa ,  whoa .  what makes you think we &apos;re gonna break up ?  
well ,  have you been involved with someone where you haven &apos;t broken up ?  
 no .  but .  .  .  it only has to happen once .  look ,  you and i both know we are perfect for each other ,  right ?  i mean .  .  .  so ,  the only question is .  .  .  are you attracted to me ?  
i don &apos;t know .  .  .  i mean ,  i &apos;ve never looked at you that way before .  
well ,  start looking .   
wow .  
exactly !  and you just know i &apos;m gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic !  
right !  you &apos;re right !  
heh .  .  .  y &apos;know ?  
you know what ?  
what ?  
i forgot .  .  .  i am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport .  i am so sorry !  i &apos;m so .  .  .  if you want to stay ,  and finish your drinks ,  please do .  .  .  .   i meani &apos;m sorry .  i - i - i gotta go .  i &apos;m sorry .   
 excuse me ,  pardon me ,  excuse me ,  excuse me ,  sorry .  hi .

you don &apos;t think they &apos;ll judge and ridicule me ?  
no ,  no ,  they will .  i just .  .  .  uh .  .  .  
ok ,  so this is pretty much what &apos;s happened so far .  ross was in love with rachel since ,  you know ,  forever ,  but every time he tried to tell her ,  something kind of got in the way ,  like cats ,  and italian guys .  finally chandler was like  &quot; forget about her &quot;  but when ross was in china on his dig ,  chandler let it slip that ross was in love with rachel .  she was like ,   &quot; oh my god .  &quot;  so she went to the airport to meet him when he came back ,  but what she didn &apos;t know was ,  that ross was getting off the plane with another woman .  uh - oh !  so ,  that &apos;s pretty much everything you need to know .  but ,  enough about us .  so ,  how &apos;ve you been ?  opening credits

god ?  
it was you ,  pal .  
well ,  maybe it was god ,  doing me .  
look ,  you were right .  she looks at me and sees a friend ,  that &apos;s all .  but then i met julie ,  and i don &apos;t know ,  we &apos;re havin &apos; a great time .  and i have to say ,  i never would &apos;ve gone for it with her if it hadn &apos;t been for you .

he said .  .  . he said ,  he said that they &apos;re having a great time .  i &apos;m sorry .  but ,  the silver lining ,  if you wanna see it ,  is that he made the decision all by himself !  without any outside help whatsoever .

it &apos;s too soon to tell .  she &apos;s resting ,  which is a good sign .  
how &apos;s the hair ?  
i &apos;m not gonna lie to you ,  ross ,  it doesn &apos;t look good .  i put a clip on one side ,  which seems to have stopped the curling .  
can we see her ?  
your hair looks too good ,  i think it would upset her .  ross ,  why don &apos;t you come on in .  
yeah .    
how &apos;re you doing ?  
i &apos;m okay .  
ooh ,  that bad ,  huh ?  
what ?  
look ,  i can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable .  it &apos;s one of my gifts .  
when i saw him get off that plane with her ,  i really thought i hit rock bottom .  but today ,  it &apos;s like there &apos;s rock bottom ,  50 feet of crap ,  then me .  
you gotta tell ross how you feel .  
come on .  how can i just tell him ?  what about julie ?  
what about her ?  they &apos;ve only been going out for two weeks .  ross has been in love with you for like 10 years .  
i don &apos;t know ,  i don &apos;t know .  
look ,  rach ,  rach !  i &apos;ve been with my share of women .  in fact ,  i &apos;ve been with like a lot of people &apos;s share of women .  the point is ,  i &apos;ve never felt about anyone the way ross felt about you .  
 yo ,  paisan !  can i talk to you for a sec ?   your tailor is a very bad man !  
frankie ?  what &apos;re you talking about ?

cupping .  
that &apos;s how they do pants !  first they go up one side ,  they move it over ,  then they go up the other side ,  they move it back ,  and then they do the rear .   what ?  ross ,  ross ,  would you tell him ?  isn &apos;t that how they measure pants ?

 wait ,  are you leaving ?  
yeah ,  that &apos;s kinda what i meant by  &quot; bye !  &quot;  
well ,  can i talk to you for a sec ?  
okay .   
hey ,  when the doctor does that hernia test .  .  .  
that &apos;s ok .   
what &apos;s goin &apos; on ?  
well ,  first of all ,  paulo and i are not back together .  it was just a stupid thing i did ,  and if i could go back in time and do it again ,  well ,  i wouldn &apos;t .  um ,  second of all  ,  what ?  
ok .  well ,  before i say anything ,  i just need to know ,  is this one of those things where you break up with a guy ,  and then i tell you what i think ,  and then the next day you get back together with the guy ,  and i look like a complete idiot ?  
no .  no - no - no - no .  
well ,  then ,  i think ,  i think the guy is scum .  i hate him .  i mean i actuallyi - i physically hate him .  i always have .  you are way too good to be with a guy like that .  
really ?  
you deserve to be with someone who appreciates you ,  and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing ,  and adorable ,  and sexy you are ,  you know ?  someone who wakes up every morning thinking  &quot; oh my god ,  i &apos;m with rachel &quot;  .  you know ,  someone who makes you feel good ,  the way i am with julie .   was there a second of all ?  
no ,  i think that was the whole all .  
okay .  okay .   okay .   
i was thinking of doing it a little shorter ,  you know ,  like andie mcdowell &apos;s new haircut ?  
oh yeah !  oh ,  i can do that .

what did you just do ?  
i licked my arm ,  what ?  
it &apos;s breast milk .  
so ?  
phoebe ,  that is juice ,  squeezed from a person .  
what is the big deal ?   
what did you just do ?  
ok ,  would people stop drinking the breast milk ?  
you won &apos;t even taste it ?  
no !  
not even if you just pretend that it &apos;s milk ?  
hey ,  where is everybody ?  
they took ben to the park .  where &apos;ve you been ?  
just out .  had some lunch ,  just me ,  little quality time with me .  thanks for your jacket .  
oh ,  no problem .  you can borrow it ,  by the way .   here are your keys ,  hon .   
okay .  
mon ,  if uh you were at lunch alone ,  how come it cost you uh 53 dollars ?  
you know what probably happened ?  someone musta stolen my credit card .  
and sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket ?  
that is an excellent excellent question .  that is excellent .  
monica ,  what is with you ?  who &apos;d you have lunch with ?  
judy .  
who ?  
julie .  
what ?  !  
jody !  
you were with julie ?  
look ,  when it started i was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother &apos;s girlfriend .  and then ,  one thing led to another and ,  before i knew it ,  we were .  .  . shopping .  
oh .  oh my god .  
honey ,  wait .  we only did it once .  it didn &apos;t mean anything to me .  
yeah ,  right .  sure !  
really ,  rachel ,  i was thinking of you the whole time .  look ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  all right .  i never meant for you to find out !  
oh ,  please ,  you wanted to get caught .   
that is not true !  
oh ,  so you just sort of happened to leave it in here ?  
did it ever occur to you that i might just be that stupid ?  
 hi ,  who &apos;s this ?   hi ,  joanne .  is rachel working ?  it &apos;s monica .   yes ,  i know i did a horrible thing .   joanne ,  it &apos;s not as simple as all that ,  ok ?   no ,  i don &apos;t care what steve thinks .   hi ,  steve .   
how did we do ?  
oh ,  i tasted ben &apos;s milk ,  and ross freaked out .  
i did not freak out .  
why &apos;d you freak out ?  
because it &apos;s breast milk .  it &apos;s gross .  
my breast milk is gross ?  
this should be fun .  
no ,  no ,  carol .  there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .  i just ,  i just don &apos;t think breast milk is for adults .  
of course the packaging does appeal to grown - ups and kids alike .  
ross ,  you &apos;re being silly .  i &apos;ve tried it ,  it &apos;s no big deal .  just taste it .   
 that would be no .  
come on .  it doesn &apos;t taste bad .  
yeah ,  it &apos;s kinda sweet ,  sorta like ,  uh .  .  .  
cantaloupe juice .  
exactly .  
 you &apos;ve tasted it ?  you &apos;ve tasted it .  
uh huh .  
oh ,  you &apos;ve tasted it .  
you can keep saying it ,  but it won &apos;t stop being true .  
howdy .  
 gimme a box a juice .  well ,  they switched me over to hombre .  
well ,  maybe it &apos;s because of the way you &apos;re dressed .  
or maybe it &apos;s because this guy &apos;s doing so good they wanna put more people on it .   you should see this guy ,  chandler ,  he goes through two bottles a day .  
 what do you care ?  you &apos;re an actor .  this is your day job .  this isn &apos;t supposed to mean anything to you .  
i know ,  but ,  i was the best ,  you know ?  i liked being the best .   i don &apos;t know .  maybe i should just get outta the game .  they need guys up in housewares to serve cheese .  
 all right ,  say you do that .  you know sooner or later somebody &apos;s gonna come along that slices a better cheddar .  and then where &apos;re you gonna run ?  
yeah i guess you &apos;re right .  
you &apos;re damn right i &apos;m right .  i say you show this guy what you &apos;re made of .  i say you stand your ground .  i say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie .  
i &apos;m gonna do it .   
i don &apos;t know what else to say .  
well that works out good ,  because i &apos;m not listening .  
i feel terrible ,  i really do .  
oh ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  did my back hurt your knife ?  
rachel ,   say that i &apos;m friends with her ,  we spend some time together .  is that so terrible ?  
yes .  
it &apos;s that terrible ?  
yes .  monica ,  you don &apos;t get it .  it &apos;s bad enough that she &apos;s stolen the guy who might actually be the person that i am supposed to be with ,  but now ,  she &apos;s actually  ,  but now she &apos;s actually stealing you .  
me ?  what are you talking about ?  nobody could steal me from you .  i mean ,  just because i &apos;m friends with her doesn &apos;t make me any less friends with you .  i mean ,   you &apos;re my .  .  . we &apos;re ,  we &apos;re .  .  . oh ,  i love you .  
i love you too .   
you guys ,  um i know that this really doesn &apos;t have anything to do with me ,  but um i love you guys too .   oh ,  i really needed that .   
look ,  i know that you &apos;re in a place right now where you really need to hate julie &apos;s guts ,  but she didn &apos;t do anything wrong .  i mean ,  she was just a girl who met a guy ,  and now they go out .  i really think that if you gave her a chance ,  you &apos;d like her .  would you just give that a chance ,  for me ?  
 i &apos;d do anything for you ,  you know that .  
 i &apos;d do anything for you .   
mornin &apos; .   i said ,  mornin &apos; .  
yeah ,  i &apos;m ready .   
you idiot ,  you stupid cowboy ,  you blinded me ,  i &apos;m suing !  
 my god ,  what happened ?  
these new kids ,  they never last .  sooner or later ,  they all .  .  . stop lastin &apos; .  listen ,  uh ,  what do you say i buy you that cup of coffee now ?  
so .  
so .  i just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit .  i mean ,  you know ,  we &apos;ve never really talked .  i guess you &apos;d know that ,  being one of the two of us ,  though ,  right ?  
i know ,  i probably shouldn &apos;t even tell you this ,  but i &apos;m pretty much totally intimidated by you .  
really ?  me ?  
yes .  oh my god ,  are you kidding ?  ross is so crazy about you ,  and i really wanted you to like me ,  and ,  it &apos;s probably me being totally paranoid ,  but i kinda got the feeling that maybe you don &apos;t .  
well ,  you &apos;re not totally paranoid .  
oy .  
um ,  ok ,  uh ,  oh god ,  um ,  when you and uh ross first started going out ,  it was really hard for me ,  um ,  for many reasons ,  which i &apos;m not gonna bore you with now ,  but um ,  i just ,  i see how happy he is ,  you know ,  and how good you guys are together ,  and um ,  monica &apos;s always saying how nice you are ,  and god i hate it when she &apos;s right .  
thanks .  hey ,  listen ,  would you like to go to a movie sometime or something ?  
yeah ,  that &apos;d be great .  i &apos;d love it .  
i &apos;d love it too .  shoot ,  i gotta go .  so ,  i &apos;ll talk to you later .  
all right ,  julie .

i got it .  uh ,  joey ,  women don &apos;t have adam &apos;s apples .  
you guys are messing with me ,  right ?  
yeah .

too easy ?  too .  .  . the process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single - celled organisms ,  is - is too easy ?  
yeah ,  i just don &apos;t buy it .

uh - oh .  it &apos;s isaac newton ,  and he &apos;s pissed .   
there she is .  and over there ,  that &apos;s the other one .  this is mr .  buddy boyle ,  mr . _heckles &apos; attorney .  he &apos;d like to talk to you .

just don &apos;t .  look at this funky shirt !  
pheebs ,  i have studied evolution my entire adult life .  ok ,  i can tell you ,  we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species ,  ok ?  you can literally see them evolving through time .  
really ?  you can actually see it ?  
you bet .  in the u . s .  ,  china ,  africa ,  all over .  
see ,  i didn &apos;t know that .  
well ,  there you go .

ok ,  look ,  before you even start ,  i &apos;m not denying evolution ,  ok ,  i &apos;m just saying that it &apos;s one of the possibilities .  
it &apos;s the only possibility ,  phoebe .  
ok ,  ross ,  could you just open your mind like this much ,  ok ?   wasn &apos;t there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat ?  and ,  up until like what ,  50 years ago ,  you all thought the atom was the smallest thing ,  until you split it open ,  and this like ,  whole mess of crap came out .  now ,  are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can &apos;t admit that there &apos;s a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this ?   
there might be a teeny tiny possibility .  
i can &apos;t believe you caved .  
what ?  
you just abandoned your whole belief system .  i mean ,  before ,  i didn &apos;t agree with you ,  but at least i respected you .  how ,  how ,  how are you going to go into work tomorrow ?  how ,  how are you going to face the other science guys ?  how ,  how are you going to face yourself ?   oh !  that was fun .  so who &apos;s hungry ?

you have got to get over this .  you &apos;re not gonna end up alone .  
of course i am .  i reject anyone who &apos;s crazy enough to actually go out with me ,  and then i bitch about the fact that there aren &apos;t any great women out there .

hey pheebs .  
how come you &apos;re watching a rabbi play electric guitar ?

so ,  scott asked me to come over for lunch today and i did .  
and ?  
and we did .  
all right pheebs ,  way to go .  
yay me .  
so ,  so how did it happen ?  
well ,  i finally took your advice and asked him what was going on .  
and what did he say ?  
he said that ,  um ,  he understands how sex can be like ,  a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that i was gonna get all ,  y &apos;know ,  like ,   &apos;ohh ,  is he gonna call me the next day &apos; and ,  y &apos;know ,   &apos;where is this going &apos; and ,  ya know ,  blah - la - la - la - la .  so he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious .  
wow .  
yeah ,  so i said ,   &quot; okay ,  relax please ,  &quot;  y &apos;know ,  i mean ,  sex can be just about two people right there in the moment ,  y &apos;know ,  it &apos;s ,  if he wants to see me again he can call and if not ,  that &apos;s fine too .  so after a looooot of talking .   .   .  i convinced him .  
let me get this straight .  he got you to beg to sleep with him ,  he got you to say he never has to call you again ,  and he got you thinking this was a great idea .  
um - hum .  
hi .  
i didn &apos;t get a cat .  
oh ,  that &apos;s um ,  interesting .  
no ,  no it &apos;s not interesting .  okay ,  it &apos;s very ,  very not interesting .  in fact it &apos;s actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting .  
all right ,  i got it ross .  
you had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me .  
 what ?  
i was doing great with julie before i found out about you .  
hey ,  i was doin &apos; great before i found out about you .  you think it &apos;s easy for me to see you with julie ?  
then you should have said something before i met her .  
i didn &apos;t know then .  and how come you never said anything to me .  
there was never a good time .  
right ,  you ,  you only had a year .  we only hung out every night .  
not ,  not ,  not every night .  you know ,  and .  .  .  and it &apos;s not like i didn &apos;t try ,  rachel ,  but things got in the way ,  y &apos;know ?  like ,  like italian guys or ex - fiancs or ,  or ,  or italian guys .  
hey ,  there was one italian guy ,  okay ,  and do you even have a point ?  
the point is i .  .  .  i don &apos;t need this right now ,  okay .  it ,  it &apos;s too late ,  i &apos;m with somebody else ,  i &apos;m happy .  this ship has sailed .  
yeah ,  what &apos;re you saying ,  you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me ?  
hey ,  i &apos;ve been doin &apos; it since the ninth grade ,  i &apos;ve gotten pretty damn good at it .

he won &apos;t ?   he won &apos;t !  because ,  isn &apos;t that ,  isn &apos;t that the ,  the short story you were writing ?  
yes ,  yes it is ,  short story ,  that i was writing .  
and i &apos;m in it ?  then let me read it .

 alright .    &quot; it was summer ,  and it was hot .  rachel was there .  a lonely gray couch .   &apos;oh ,  look ,  &apos; cried ned ,  and then the kingdom was his forever .  the end .  &quot;  
that &apos;s it ?  that &apos;s all you wrote ?  you &apos;re the worst writer in the whole world .

no ,  you don &apos;t .  
all right ,  you know what ,  that &apos;s fine .  if you guys want to be children about this ,  that &apos;s fine .  i do not need to see it .

good luck .   
ok ,  just ,  just remember how crazy i am about you ,  ok ?  
kind of ditzy ?  too into her looks ?  spoiled ?  
now that &apos;s a little spoiled .  he was supposed to type  &quot; little &quot;  ,  the idiot .  
just a waitress ?  
no ,  that ,  that was ,  i mean ,  as opposed to uh ,  the uh ,  ok .  is this over yet rach ?  
oh !  i do not have chubby ankles !   
no ,  no ,  wait ,  ok ,  ok ,  look at the other side .  look at julie &apos;s column .  
she is not rachem .  what the hell &apos;s a rachem ?  is that some stupid paleontology word that i wouldn &apos;t know because i &apos;m just a waitress .   
my diary !  my diary ,  that &apos;s brilliant .  i should have told her it was my diary ,  she never would have made me read her my diary .  
you know ,  that &apos;s true .  you &apos;d be a great person to have around the day after an emergency .  
i .  .  .  i cannot believe ross even made this list .  what a dinkus .  
hey ,  cut him some slack .  it was chandler &apos;s idea .  
what ?  
what ?  
oh good ,  i was hoping that would come up .  
this was your idea ?  
what were you thinking ?  
 all right ,  let &apos;s get some perspective here ,  ok ?  these things ,  they happen for a reason .  
yeah .  you !  
all right ,  pheebs ,  back me up here ,  ok ?  you believe in that karma crap ,  don &apos;t you ?  
rach !  whoops !  rach ,  hey ,  open up ,  please !

no ,  you guys ,  you really don &apos;t have to go ,  we &apos;re done talking .  
rach ,  come on ,  look ,  i know how you must feel .  
 no ,  you don &apos;t ,  ross .  imagine the worst things you think about yourself .  now ,  how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too ,  but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you .  
no ,  but ,  but i wanna be with you in spite of all those things .  
oh ,  well ,  that &apos;s ,  that &apos;s mighty big of you ,  ross .   i said don &apos;t go !  
you know what ?  you know what ?  if ,  things were the other way around ,  there &apos;s nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you .  
well ,  then ,  i guess that &apos;s the difference between us .  see ,  i &apos;d never make a list .   
now ,  in some of these recipes ,  the quantities may seem just a little unusual ,  uh ,  like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars .  i &apos;ve indicated four cups of coconut ,  and four cups of crushed nut ,  and only ,  uh ,  one tablespoon of mockolate .  
doesn &apos;t matter .  
what ?  
our fda approval didn &apos;t come through .  something about laboratory rats .

well ,  uh ,  i ate some .

the next one &apos;s dedicated to rachel from ross .  rachel ,  he wants you to know he &apos;s deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him .    
hi ,  thanks for coming in again .  
oh ,  not at all .  i have no morals and i need the cash .  
it &apos;s like i &apos;m lookin &apos; in a mirror .  anyway ,  they &apos;re called  &quot; fishtachios &quot;  .  they taste exactly like pistachios ,  but they &apos;re made primarily of reconstituted fish bits .  here ,  try one .  you &apos;re not allergic to anything ,  are you ?

oh god .  
it was your mother &apos;s idea .  ya know ,  she didn &apos;t want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left ,  and ,  i didn &apos;t want to go along with it ,  but ,  well then she died and ,  and it was harder to argue with her .  not impossible ,  but harder .  
alright ,  so ,  what ,  he &apos;s not a famous tree surgeon ?  and then ,  i guess ,  ok ,  he doesn &apos;t live in a hut in burma where there &apos;s no phones ?  
last i heard ,  he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate .  
ok ,  that makes no sense .  why would the villagers worship a pharmacist ?  
honey .  
 oh .  
anyway ,  that &apos;s all i know .  that ,  and this .   this is the real him .  
ya know i remember my father ,  all dressed up in the red suit ,  the big black boots ,  and the patent leather belt ,  sneakin around downstairs .  he didn &apos;t want anybody to see him but he &apos;d be drunk so he &apos;d stumble ,  crash into something and wake everybody up .

oh ,  right .  um ,  i &apos;ve got some news .  it &apos;s about us .  
oh ,  you and me ?  
uh ,  no ,  susan and me .  
the other us .  
ok .  
we &apos;re uh ,  we &apos;re getting married .  
as in ,   &quot; i now pronounce you wife and wife &quot;  married ?  
anyway ,  we &apos;d like you to come ,  but we totally understand if you don &apos;t want to .  
why wouldn &apos;t i want to come ?  i had fun at the first wedding .  
look i just thought that .  .  .  
no no no ,  i mean ,  hey ,  why shouldn &apos;t i be happy for you ?  what would it say about me if i couldn &apos;t revel in your joy ?  i &apos;m revelling baby ,  believe me !  
is your finger caught in that chair ?  
mmm hmmm .  
want us to go ?  
uh - huh .   
this is so cool .  you &apos;re actually gonna be on television .  
it really hit me last night .  i &apos;m gonna be on days of our lives .  and then i started thinkin &apos; about all of u ,  and how these are the days of our lives .  .  
yes !  carol and susan &apos;s caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend ,  and she &apos;s in a full body cast .  
they want me to do it ,  which is really cool ,  seeing as i &apos;ve never catered before ,  and i really need the money ,  and this isn &apos;t a problem for you ,  is it ?  
would it matter ?  
oh ,  you are so great !   thank you !  
are you really not going ?  
i am really not going .  i don &apos;t get it .  they already live together ,  why do they need to get married ?  
they love each other ,  and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them .  
if you wanna call that a reason .  
 who &apos;s the bitterest man in the living room ,  the bitterest man in the living room ?  hi ,  neighbor .  
ross ,  i thought you were over this .  
look ,  that has nothing to do with this ,  ok ?  she &apos;s my ex - wife .  if she were marrying a guy ,  none of you &apos;d expect me to be there .  
hey ,  if she were marrying a guy ,  she &apos;d be like the worst lesbian ever .  
 did i miss it ?  did i miss it ?  
no ,  i &apos;m on right after this guy shoots himself .  
whoa ,  she &apos;s pretty .  
yeah ,  and she &apos;s really nice too .  she taught me all about how to work the cameras ,  and smell - the - fart acting .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  what ?  
what ?  
it &apos;s like ,  you got so many lines to learn so fast ,  that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one .  so while you &apos;re thinkin &apos; of it ,  you take this big pause where you look all intense ,  you know ,  like this .  
oh ,  ok .  
there &apos;s my scene ,  there &apos;s my scene .    &quot; mrs .  wallace ,  i &apos;m dr .  drake ramoray ,  your sister &apos;s neurosurgeon .  
i &apos;m afraid the situation is much worse than we expected .  your sister is suffering from a .  . subcranial hematoma .  perhaps we can discuss this over coffee .  
nice !  
that &apos;s great !  
excellent !  
for a minute there i thought you were actually tryin &apos; to smell something .   
that is so good !  do it again !  
all right ,  all right .   &quot; damnit braverman ,  it &apos;s right there on the chart !  &quot;  
that &apos;s great .  all right ,  i gotta get to work ,  i got a big dinosaur bone to inspect .  
no no ,  that &apos;s me .  
oh ,  yeah .  
oh ,  hello .  
oh ,  thanks .  i couldn &apos;t uh .  .  .  
is everything ok ?  
um ,  no ,  huh - uh .  one of my clients died on the massage table today .  
oh my god .  
that &apos;s a little more relaxed than you want them to get .  
yeah ,  um ,  she was 82 years old .  her name was um ,  mrs .  adelman .  
oh ,  honey .  
yeah ,  it &apos;s just so strange .  i mean ,  she probably woke up today and thought ,   &quot; ok ,  i &apos;ll have some breakfast ,  and then i &apos;ll take a little walk ,  and then i &apos;ll have my massage .  &quot;  little did she know god was thinking ,   &quot; ok ,  but that &apos;s it .  &quot;  oh ,  but the weirdest thing was ,  ok ,  i was cleansing her aura when she died ,  and when the spirit left her body ,  i don &apos;t think it went very far .  
what do you mean ?  
i think it went into me .    
god ,  this is so hard .  i can &apos;t decide between lamb or duck .  
well ,  of course ,  lambs are scarier .  otherwise the movie would &apos;ve been called silence of the ducks .  
ok ,  who ordered what ?  
oh ,  i believe i had the half - drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim .  
yes ,  and this with the cigarette butt in it ,  is that decaf ?  
oh god .  
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re so uptight about your mom comin &apos; .  
i know ,  but it &apos;s just it &apos;s the first time ,  and i just don &apos;t want her to think that because i didn &apos;t marry barry ,  that my life is total crap ,  you know ?  
 talk about crap .  try listening to stella niedman tell the story of her and rod steiger for the hundredth time .  
uh ,  pheebs ,  how long do you think this lady &apos;ll be with us ?  
i don &apos;t know .  i mean ,  she obviously has some kind of unfinished business .   sit up !  
mom !  is it a restaurant ?  who can tell ?  but i guess that &apos;s the fun .  
pretty much .  
this is joey ,  and phoebe ,  and this is chandler ,  and you remember ross .  
hi ,  mrs .  green .   
oh mom !  
believe me ,  sometimes that happens .  father &apos;s house to the sorority house to my husband &apos;s house .  i am just so proud of you .  
really ?  
i know who it is you remind me of .  evelyn dermer .   &apos;course ,  that &apos;s before she got the lousy face lift .  now she looks like soupy sales .  
pheebs ,  who &apos;s evelyn dermer ?  
i don &apos;t know .  who &apos;s soupy sales ?  [at rachel and monica &apos;s 
yeah ,  well just be glad he &apos;s not playing a smaller instrument .  
i know .  and mom ,  i realize you and daddy were upset when i didn &apos;t marry barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything ,  but this is just so much better for me ,  you know ?  you and i think ,  oh ,  this is what i want .  
for .  .  . me .  
well ,  what do you mean ?  
 all right .  tell me if this is too cute .  lesbian wedding ,  chicken breasts .  
oh god .  i think i &apos;m gonna be sick .  
why ?  it &apos;s not like i &apos;m putting little nipples on them .  
and you had no idea they weren &apos;t getting along ?  
none .  
they didn &apos;t fight a lot ?  
no !  they didn &apos;t even talk to each other .  god ,  how was i supposed to know they were having problems ?  
 in my day ,  divorce was not an option .  
hey ,  look who &apos;s up .  
i just can &apos;t believe this is happening .  i mean ,  when i was little ,  everybody &apos;s parents were getting divorced .  i just figured as a grownup i wouldn &apos;t have to worry about this .  
is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering ?  i mean ,  she &apos;s doing it because she wants to be more like you .  
well ,  then ,  you know ,  couldn &apos;t she have just copied my haircut ?  
you know ,  it &apos;s funny when my parents got divorced ,  they sent me to this shrink ,  and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves .  but in your case it &apos;s actually kinda true .  
that &apos;s him .  
damn .  my mail order grandfather hasn &apos;t come yet .  
yes ,  hi ,  mr .  adelman .  thanks for meeting me .  
um ,  do you wanna sit ?  i do for you ,  my dear ?  
i don &apos;t know how to say this ,  but i think when your wife &apos;s spirit left her body ,  it um ,  kind of stuck around in me .  
yeah .  ok ,  you don &apos;t have to believe me but um ,  can you think of any unfinished business she might have had ,  like any reason she &apos;d be hanging around ?  she always used to say that before she died ,  she wanted to see everything .  
everything ?  
whoa ,  that &apos;s a lot of stuff .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  there &apos;s laughing in my head .   
these are from halloween three years ago .  
no ,  that was his costume .  see ,  he &apos;s actually an orthodontist ,  but he came as a regular dentist .  
um ,  you guys ,  you know when i said before ,   &quot; thank you ,  but i don &apos;t really need your help &quot;  ?  
actually ,  what i think you said was ,   &quot; don &apos;t touch that ,  and get the hell out of my kitchen .  &quot;  
really ?  weird .  anyway ,  see ,  i planned everything really well .  i planned and i planned and i planned .  it just turns out ,  i don &apos;t think i planned enough time to actually do it .  
hey ,  mon ,  you want some help ?  
if you want .  
 hey .  what a day .  i took her everywhere .  the museum of modern art ,  rockefeller center ,  statue of liberty .  
she &apos;s still with you ?  
yeah .  i guess she hasn &apos;t seen everything yet .  i &apos;ll be right back ,  she has to go to the bathroom again .   oh ,  such a pretty face .  anybody have any marijuana ?  
god !  
all right ,  look ,  nobody &apos;s smoking pot around all this food .  
oh !  what &apos;s new in sex ?  
i &apos;m dicing ,  i &apos;m dicing ,  i don &apos;t hear anything .  might be more .  
oh ,  i &apos;m sorry .  you know what ?  i cannot have this conversation with you .  i mean ,  god ,  you just come in here ,  and drop this bomb on me ,  before you even tell daddy .  what ?  what do you want ?  do you want my blessing ?  
you want me to talk you out of it ?  
then what ?  what do you want ?  
why on earth would i understand this ?  
oh .  
all right people ,  we &apos;re in trouble here .  we &apos;ve only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left .  move ,  move ,  move !  
monica ,  i feel like you should have german subtitles .  
joey ,  speed it up !  
i &apos;m sorry ,  it &apos;s the pigs .  they &apos;re reluctant to get in the blankets !  
monica ,  how did this happen ?  i thought you had this all planned out .  
do you want me to cry ?  is that what you want ?  do you wanna see me cry ?  
sir !  no sir !  
 all right ,  you !  
no .  look ,  i told you i am not a part of this thing .  
all right ,  look ,  ross .  i realize that you have issues with carol and susan ,  and i feel for you ,  i do .  but if you don &apos;t help me cook ,  i &apos;m gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs ,  and i &apos;m gonna create a new appetizer called  &quot; pigs in ross &quot;  .  all right ,  ball the melon .  
hey !  how come i &apos;m stuck dicing ,  when he gets to ball the melon .   
hi .  
how &apos;s it going ?  
it &apos;s goin &apos; great .  right on schedule .  got my little happy helpers .  
fine ,  whatever .  
what &apos;s the matter ?  
nothing .  ok ,  everything .  i think we &apos;re calling off the wedding .  
what ?  
you &apos;re still gonna pay me ,  right ?  or something a little less selfish .  
carol ,  what &apos;s the matter ?  what happened ?  
my parents called this afternoon to say they weren &apos;t coming .  
oh my god .  
i mean ,  i knew they were having trouble with this whole thing ,  but they &apos;re my parents .  they &apos;re supposed to give me away and everything .  
it &apos;s ok .  i &apos;m sorry .  
and then susan and i got in this big fight because i said maybe we should call off the wedding ,  and she said we weren &apos;t doing it for them ,  we were doing it for us ,  and if i couldn &apos;t see that ,  then maybe we should call off the wedding .  i don &apos;t know what to do .  
i uh can &apos;t believe i &apos;m gonna say this ,  but i think susan &apos;s right .  
you do ?  
look ,  do you love her ?  and you don &apos;t have to be too emphatic about this .  
of course i do .  
well then that &apos;s it .  and if george and adelaide can &apos;t accept that ,  then the hell with them .  look ,  if my parents didn &apos;t want me to marry you ,  no way that would have stopped me .  look ,  this is your wedding .  do it .  
you &apos;re right .  of course you &apos;re right .  
so we &apos;re back on ?  
we &apos;re back on .  
you heard the woman .  peel ,  chop ,  devil !  i can &apos;t believe i lost 2 minutes .   
it just seems so futile ,  you know  ?  all these women ,  and nothing .  i feel like superman without my powers ,  you know ?  i have the cape ,  and yet i cannot fly .  
well now you understand how i feel every single day ,  ok ?  the world is my lesbian wedding .   
 butterscotch ?  no one ?  all right ,  you &apos;ll be sorry later .   
thank you .  
any time .

 oh my god .  now i &apos;ve seen everything !   whoa ,  she &apos;s gone .  she &apos;s gone .  she &apos;s gone !  go ahead ,  get married .  go ,  go .

yeah ,  can &apos;t help but .  
 how &apos;s that pig - in - the - blanket workin &apos; out for you ?   i wrapped those bad boys .  
i miss rose .  
oh ,  yeah ?  
i know it &apos;s kind of weird ,  but i mean ,  she was a big part of my life there ,  you know ,  and now i just feel kind of alone .  
you know ,  i uh ,  i couldn &apos;t help but overhear what you just said ,  and i think it &apos;s time for you to forget about rose ,  move on with your life .  .  . how  &apos;bout we go get you a drink ?  
ok ,  that &apos;s so nice .   
 i shouldn &apos;t even bother coming up with a line ,  right ?   
hey ,  mom ?  having fun ?  girls made eyes at me over the buffet .  oh ,  i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s something i wanna pursue ,  but it &apos;s nice to know i have options .  
there &apos;s more alcohol ,  right ?   
how you doin &apos; ?  
ok .  
you did a good thing today .  
yeah .

ok .   
 all right look .  penis schmenis .  we &apos;re all people .    
ok ,  which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married ?  
well ,  mon ,  i was married .  
yeah ,  me ,  too ,  technically .  
i had a wedding .  
all right ,  just trying to start an interesting discussion .  
i got one .  which one of us do you think will be the last to get married ?   
isn &apos;t ben in this ?  
can &apos;t get the monkey off your back ?  then put it in your mouth .  .  .  
 .  .  . with monkeyshine beer .   monkeyshine beer ,   &apos;cause it &apos;s a jungle out there . ] 
that commercial always makes me so sad .  
yeah ,  but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him ,  so ,  everything seems to work out ok .  
i meant because the monkey in it reminds me of marcel .  
i can see that ,   &apos;cause they both have those big brown eyes and ,  ya know ,  the little pouty chin .  
and the fact that they &apos;re both monkeys .  
sometimes i wonder if i did the right thing ,  ya know ,  giving him away .  
oh ,  ross ,  you had to ,  i mean ,  he was humping everything in sight .  i mean ,  i have a malibu barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding .  
remember when sometimes he &apos;d borrow your hat ,  and ,  and when you got it back there &apos;d be little monkey raisins in it .  
hey ,  hey ,  check it out ,  guess what i got .  
rhythm ?  
no ,  my first fan mail .  
alright !  
  &apos;dear dr .  remore ,  know that i love you and would do anything to have you .  &apos; gosh .   &apos;your not - so - secretive admirer ,  erica ford .  &apos; ooh wait ,   &apos;ps enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes .  &apos; 
ya know ,  in crazy world ,  that means you &apos;re married .  
this wasn &apos;t addressed to days of our lives ,  this is ,  this came to your apartment .  there &apos;s no stamp on it ,  this woman was in our building .  
oh my god ,  i got my very own stalker .   
hey guys .  
hey .  
ooh ,  where are you off to ,  travelin &apos; jake ?  
well ,  there &apos;s this ,  uh ,  paleontology conference in l . a .  so i figured i &apos;d go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise marcel .  
you know i think he will be surprised ,   &apos;till he realizes he &apos;s a monkey ,  and uh ,  you know ,  isn &apos;t capable of that emotion .   
oh ,  phoebe ,  that really cute guy is here again .  
oh ,  oh ,  ok ,  so everyone ,  pretend like i &apos;m telling you a story ,  ok .  and ,  and it &apos;s really funny .  so everyone just laugh ,  now .   
i know ,  i know .   hello .  
hi .  i &apos;m rob dohnen .  
hi rob dohnen .  
i don &apos;t know anything about music ,  but i think you &apos;re really ,  really great .  
oh ,  wow .  
anyway ,  i schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and i was just thinking ,  have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids ?  
hey ,  whaddya wanna do for dinner ?  
well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves .    
hello .  
it &apos;s erica .  
ah ,  the stalker .  
never mind ,  it &apos;s open .  
 yes ,  hitting her with a frying pan &apos;s a good idea .  we might wanna have a backup plan ,  though ,  just in case she isn &apos;t a cartoon .  
let &apos;s get out of here .   
the one time they &apos;re not home .  
ok ,  we &apos;ll just leave ,  and when we pass her on the stairs ,  she won &apos;t know it &apos;s me  &apos;cause we &apos;ve never met .  
that &apos;s how radio stars escape stalkers .  
she &apos;s comin &apos; .   
it &apos;s me .  
uhh ,  this is it ,  this is how we &apos;re gonna die .  ready ?  
wait ,  wait ,  wait .    
hi .  
hi ,  dean lipson ,  zoo administrator .  i was told you had a question .  
well ,  i uh ,  i can &apos;t seem to find the monkey i donated last year .  he &apos;s a capuchan ,  answers to the name marcel .  
ahh ,  i &apos;m afraid i have some bad news .  marcel has passed on .  
oh my god ,  what happened ?  
well he got sick ,  and then he got sicker ,  and then he got a little better but then he died .  
i can &apos;t believe this .  
i &apos;m sorry mr . _geller .  but ya know ,  there &apos;s an old saying ,   &apos;sometimes monkeys die .  &apos; it &apos;s not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today .  
well ,  ya know ,  someone should have called me .  
i &apos;m sorry .  look ,  i know this can &apos;t bring him back but here ,  it &apos;s just a gesture .  
zoo dollars ?  
yes ,  and come see the bird show at 4 .  the macaws wear hats .  well it &apos;s a lot cuter if your monkey hasn &apos;t just died .  
 
ooohhh .  
i know .  
i can &apos;t believe joey &apos;s having lunch with his stalker .  what i -  ,  what is she like .  
well ,  you remember cathy bates in misery ?  
well ,  she looks the exact opposite of that .  
and she &apos;s not crazy ?  
oh no no no ,  she &apos;s a total wack job .  yeah ,  she thinks that joey is actually dr .  drake remore .  
oh my god .  
ah ,  and i mean ,  he &apos;s going out with her ?  he can not persue this .  
hey ,  just because this woman thinks she can actually see joey through the magical box in her living room doesn &apos;t mean she &apos;s not a person .  i mean ,  does she not deserve happiness ,  does she not deserve love ?  what &apos;re you lookin &apos; at me for ?  he &apos;s the one who wants to boff the maniac .  
you ok ?  
no ,  uh - uh ,  i &apos;m just ,  i &apos;m nervous .  so ,  you know what ,  maybe if i just ,  if i picture them all in their underwear .  
that &apos;s not a good idea ,  that &apos;s kinda the reason the last guy got fired .  
i &apos;m just ,  i &apos;m ,  i &apos;m ,  i &apos;m used to playing for grown - ups .  ya know ,  they just ,  grown - ups drink their coffee and do their grown - up thing ,  ya know ,  and kids listen .  this is a huge responsibility .  what ?  are you gonna kiss me ?  
i was thinkin &apos; about it .

who &apos;s they ?  
no one .  
oh drake ,  you are so talented ,  let me see those hands .  oh these hands ,  these beautiful hands ,  oh i could just eat them .   .   .  but i won &apos;t .

i don &apos;t understand ,  why didn &apos;t you help that man ?  
uhh ,  cause ,  uhh ,  i &apos;m a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of ,  uh ,  uh ,  foodal chokage .  alright ,  look ,  i got to tell you something .  
no ,  no no no ,  you don &apos;t have to tell me anything .  you don &apos;t have to explain yourself to me .  ooh ,  who am i to question the great dr .  drake remore ?  
but that &apos;s what .  .  .  
i should just be happy to be near you .  
hey i -   
hey what ?  
 there &apos;ll be times when you get older when you &apos;ll want to sleep with people just to make them like you .   .   .  but don &apos;t .  cause that &apos;s another thing that you don &apos;t wanna do ,  everybody that &apos;s another thing that you don &apos;t wanna do .

hi monica .  
he - he - he ,  how &apos;s it goin &apos; ?  
hey nice boobs .  
so ,  i &apos;ll get candles and my mom &apos;s lace tablecloth ,  and since it &apos;s rachel &apos;s birthday ,  i mean ,  we want it to be special ,  i thought i &apos;d poach a salmon .  
ohhh .  
what ?  
question .  why do we always have to have parties where you poach things ?  
you wanna be in charge of the food committee ?  
question two .  why do we always have to have parties with committees ?  
really .  why can &apos;t we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun ?  
yeah .  
yeah ,  i agree .  ya know ,  i think fancy parties are only fun if you &apos;re fancy on the inside and i &apos;m just not sure we are .  
alright .  if you guys don &apos;t want it to be special ,  fine .  you can throw any kind of party you want .   
joey they &apos;re not real .  i start miles beneath the surface of these things ,  ok ,  they &apos;re fake .  see  honk honk .  
i talked to rachel &apos;s sisters ,  neither of them can come .  
ok ,  um so ,  i still have to invite dillon and emma and shannon cooper .  
woah ,  woah ,  woah ,  uh ,  no shannon cooper .  
why not her ?  
cause she uh ,  she steals stuff .  
or maybe she doesn &apos;t steal stuff and joey just slept with her and never called her back .  
joey that is horriable .  
hey i liked her ,  alright .  maybe ,  maybe too much .  i don &apos;t know i guess i just got scared .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  i didn &apos;t know .  
i didn &apos;t think anyone &apos;d buy that ,  ok .   
hi honey ,  how did it go ?  
agh ,  it was the graduation from hell .  
ya know ,  my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship .  
ya know ,  i mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion .  my sister &apos;s graduating from college ,  nobody thought she would .  it &apos;s a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a celica .  
so what happened ?  
my parents happened .  all they had to do was sit in the same stadium ,  smile proudly ,  and not talk about the divorce .  but nooo ,  they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address .  bishop tutu actually had to stop and shush them .  but you know what ,  you know what the good news is ?  i get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours .  
ok ,  so i guess we don &apos;t invite her parents .  
well ,  how bout just her mom ?  
why her mom ?  
cause i already invited her .  
ooh ,  ooh ,  did you ask stacy roth ?  
ok ,  here are the birthday candles .  where &apos;s the birthday cake ?  
ok ,  we &apos;re not having birthday cake ,  we &apos;re having birthday flan .  
excuse me ?  
it &apos;s a traditional mexican custard dessert .  
oh that &apos;s nice .  happy birthday rachel ,  here &apos;s some goo .   
 dr . _greene .  oh my god it &apos;s rachel &apos;s dad .  what &apos;re you doing here ?  
what ?  the father can &apos;t drop by to see the daughter on her birthday ?  
no no ,  the father can ,  but um ,  since i am the roommate i can tell you that she &apos;s not here and i &apos;ll pass along the message ,  ok .  so bye - bye .  
ohhh ,  you &apos;re having a parteee .  
no ,  no ,  not a party .  just a surprise gathering of some people rachel knows .  um ,  this is phoebe and chandler and joey .  
i &apos;ll never remember all of that .  so uh ,  what &apos;s the deal ?  rachel comes home ,  people pop out and yell stuff ,  is that it ?  
this isn &apos;t your first surprise party ,  is it sir ?   
hi monica .

ya know ,  my party is fun .  i mean ,  maybe it &apos;s a little quieter ,  less obvious sorta fun but ,  you know ,  if people would just give it a chance .  .  .    
you want me to see a therapist ?  
sweetheart ,  you obviously have a problem .  you &apos;ve chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father .  
ok mom ,  you know what ,  fine ,  i &apos;ll make an appointment ok ,  but you know what ,  right now ,  i gotta go ,  i gotta go do a thing .   
did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees .  i felt like gulliver around that place .  
daddy ,  daddy ,  you know what ,  i really wanna hear more about this ,  i really do ,  but i just have ,  i just have to do a ,  some stuff .   
you work and you work and you work at a marriage but all he cares about is his stupid boat .   
you work and you work and you work on a boat .  .  .  
he always ridiculed my pottery classs .  .  .  
 .  .  . and you sand it and you varnish it .  .  .  
 .  .  . but when all is said and done ,  he still drinks out of the mugs .  
 .  .  . and her yoga and her bridges of madison county .  .  .  
 .  .  . the scotch and the cigarettes .  .  .  
 .  .  . and the bansai &apos;s and the chiuaua .  .  .

 ok ,  ok ,  you can be shirts and i &apos;ll be skins .  i &apos;ll be skins .   hey ,  how you holdin &apos; up there ,  tiger ?  oh ,  sorry ,  when my parents were getting divorced i got a lot of tigers .  got a lot of champs ,  chiefs ,  sports ,  i even got a governor .  
this is it ,  isn &apos;t it ?  i mean ,  this is what my life is gonna be like .  my mom there ,  my dad there .  thanksgiving ,  christmas .  she gets the house ,  he &apos;s in some condo my sister &apos;s gonna decorate with wicker .  oh ,  chandler how did you get through this ?  
well ,  i relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and ,  and wetting the bed .  
ya know ,  i just ,  so weird .  i mean i was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all i kept thinking about was the fourth of july .  
becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other ?  
it &apos;s just this thing .  every year we would go out on my dad &apos;s boat and watch the fireworks .  mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big .  my sister jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong .  but then when the fireworks started ,  everybody just shut up ,  you know ,  and it &apos;d get really cold ,  and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket .  it never occured to anybody to bring another one .  and now it &apos;s just .  .  .  
ok ,  thanks for coming ,  i hope you guys had fun .  
alright ,  monica dear ,  i &apos;m gonna hit the road .  now i &apos;ve left my 10 verbs on the table .  and you be sure and send me that finished poem .

monica .  .  .   hey mon ,  i have a question .  is leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town ?

are you remaking the bed ?  
i &apos;m sorry ,  i &apos;m sorry .  you know what ,  the way you did it was just fine .  
then ,  you &apos;re redoing it because .  .  .  
if i tell you ,  you &apos;ll think i &apos;m crazy .  
you &apos;re pretty much running that risk either way .  
ok ,  you see ,  the tag shouldn &apos;t be at the top left corner ,  it should be at the bottom right corner .  
oh ,  well that &apos;s not so crazy .  
i &apos;m just easing you in .  
oh ,  alright .  
alright ,  you see these little flower blossoms ?  they should be facing up ,  not down ,  because ,  well ,  the head of the bed is where the sun would be .  you don &apos;t love me any more do you .  
actually ,  if it &apos;s possible ,  i love you more .  
hey ,  look joey ,  i &apos;m just saying if you need something to hold you over ,  i can get you a job right here as an entry level processor .

why ?  
ooh ,  duct tape .  was i supposed to bring something too ?  
this is for the scratchy twins out there .  i taped oven mits to their hands .  
you &apos;re strict .  
it &apos;s for their own good .  
you know ,  i like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under .  see in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time .  
exactly .  oh ,  i love that i can be totally neurotic around you now .  tell me the truth .  don &apos;t you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular ?  
if it &apos;s not a right angle ,  it is a wrong angle .  
very good .  
thank you .  
you know what .  tomorrow i &apos;m gonna do your clocks .

well ,  i &apos;m confused .  i thought we shared time .  
no no .  see ,  in my bedroom i set my clock six minutes fast .  you wanna know why ?  
because it &apos;s in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen .  
no forget it ,  i &apos;m not gonna tell you now .  
no come on .  come on tell me .  
no .  see you don &apos;t understand .

you would not .  i can &apos;t believe this .  i hate this ,  you &apos;re too normal .  i can &apos;t believe my boyfriend doesn &apos;t have a thing .  my boyfriend doesn &apos;t have a thing .  
hey .  mr .  douglas is looking for you .  
why ?  wh -  wh -  why is mr .  douglas looking for me ?  
 &apos;cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the lender project .  
wha -  wh -  why ,  why ,  why does he suspect that ?  
becasue at first he thought it was joseph .  but after he asked joseph about it ,  turns out it was you .  anyway ,  i just thought you should know .  
alright ,  that &apos;s it .  look joey ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  i realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya ,  and if i could just fire joseph ,  i would ,  but unfortunately that &apos;s not possible so i &apos;m gonna have to let both of you go .  
what &apos;re you talking about ,  everybody loves joseph .  
i don &apos;t ,  i hate joseph ,  ok .  i think he &apos;s a brown - nosing suck up .  
oh yeah .  well you can &apos;t fire joseph .  you know why ,   &apos;cause he &apos;s not in your department .  
alright ,  ok ,  alright .  so i can &apos;t fire joseph but uh ,  i can sleep with his wife .  
karen .  
yeah ,  karen .  i &apos;m thinking about having an affair with her .  oh ,  you know what ?  i just did .  
ahh .  what the hell are you doing to me man .  
oh well it &apos;s not me ,  it &apos;s my character ,  chandy .  yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co - worker &apos;s wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler .  in fact ,  i have her panties right there in my drawer .

what &apos;s wrong ?  what &apos;s wrong ?  you &apos;re married that &apos;s what &apos;s wrong .   
oh ,  my .

what if the husband person is the wrong guy ,  and you are the right guy .  i mean you don &apos;t get chances like this all the time ,  if you don &apos;t meet her now ,  you &apos;re gonna be kicking yourself when your 80 ,  which is hard to do ,  and that &apos;s how you break a hip .

okay ,  one more ,  please .  come on ,  i &apos;m gonna get it in this time ,  i will .  
okay ,  last chance .   again ,  i &apos;m sorry .  
you know what ,  maybe i don &apos;t need to have children .  you know maybe i just think i do because that is what society ,  and by that i mean my mom ,  has always convinced me that i .  .  .  i do ,  i have to have children ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  i just do .  here .  thank you .   i remember when barry got home from his first date with rachel .  .  .

most of you don &apos;t know me ,  i &apos;m rachel &apos;s boyfriend .  
oh dear god .  
ross ,  uh and uh ,  i &apos;d just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for rachel to come here tonight .  and ,  uh ,  for the record she did not run out on barry because she had syphilis .   what are you doing i &apos;m serious .  uh ,  the reason she walked out on ,  on barry is simply that she didn &apos;t love him ,  which incidentally worked out pretty well for me  cheers .  
 she you in the parking lot .  
 no ,  rach !  
and once again she is out of here .  okay who had ?  um ?  
 ya ,  know what barr ,  i &apos;m not gonna leave .  i probably should ,  but i &apos;m not ,  see  &apos;cause i promised myself that i would make it through at least *one* of your weddings  .  see now ,  tonight ,  all i really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity .  well  ,  i guess we can all agree that &apos;s not gonna happen .  there &apos;s nothing really left to say except .  .  .  .   &quot; her name was lola .  she was a showgirl .  with yellow feathers  ,  feathers in her hair ,  and a dress cut down to there .  she would .  .  .  &quot;  
marenge ,

what ,  what ,  what ?  
it &apos;s an empty apartment .  
oooh .  
we &apos;re all alone in an empty apartment .  
honey ,  come on ,  i have to be at work in like ten minutes  oh ,  all right ,  well it &apos;s not like i &apos;m employee of the year or anything .    
there it is .  
oh ,  oh ,  that &apos;s what you &apos;re talking about .   hey .  
hey .  
do i look fat ?  
okay ,  i accept that .  when janice asked me and i said no ,  she took that to mean that i was calling her a cow .  
okay ,  walk us through it ,  honey ,  walk us through it .  
okay ,  well .  janice said  &apos;hi ,  do i look fat today ?  &apos; and i ,  i looked at her .  .  .  .  
whoa ,  whoa ,  whoa .  you looked at her .  you never look .  you just answer ,  it &apos;s just a reflex .  do i look fat ?  nooo !  is she prettier than i am ?  noo !  does size matter ?  
nooo !  
and it works both ways .  
okay ,  so you both just know this stuff ?  
well you know ,  after about thirty or forty fights ,  you kinda catch on .  
okay ,  for instance .  let &apos;s say ,  janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options .  option number 1 she &apos;ll take a cab home from the airport .  option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim .  which do you do ?  
that &apos;s easy ,  baggage claim .  
 wrong !  now you &apos;re single .  it &apos;s actually secret option number three ,  you meet her at the gate .  that way she knows you love her .  
okay ,  this is good ,  this is good .  all right listen ,  i have one .  janice likes to cuddle ,  at night ,  which ,  you know i &apos;m all for .  but ,  uh ,  you know when you want to go to sleep ,  you want some space .  so ,  uh ,  how do i tell her that without ,  you know ,  accidentally calling her fat or something .  
oh honey ,  i &apos;m sorry we can &apos;t help you there ,   &apos;cause we &apos;re cuddlily sleepers .   okay ,  i &apos;m late for work .  
oh .

yeah .   
i &apos;m gonna use the cushion .  
yeah .  
okay ,  you &apos;re in bed .  she &apos;s over on your side ,  cuddling .  now you wait for her to drift off ,  and then you hug her  and roll her back over to her side of the bed .  and then you rollll a - way .  hug for her !  roll for you .  
okay ,  the old hug and roll .  
yep .

umm ,  not feeling better  &apos;bout malcom .  
ooh !  no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  he &apos;s not like a kook ,  no .  he &apos;s just like this ,  this very passionate ,  incredibly romantic guy ,  that got like a tinsy bit carried away ,  you know .  and we just get along really well ,  and he &apos;s so cute .

well ,  aren &apos;t you forgetin &apos; something ?  what ,  what ,  what is uh ,  what is that guy &apos;s name ?  dad !  
it took me 28 years to find one man that i wanna spend my life with ,  if i have to wait another 28 years then ,  i &apos;ll be 56 before i can have a baby ,  and that &apos;s just stupid .  
that ,  that &apos;s what &apos;s stupid .

keep in mind ,  he &apos;s never used this product before ,  you &apos;re gonna see how easy this is to do .   go ahead .   this works with any milk carton .  
well ,  it &apos;s official there are no good movies .  
well ,  let &apos;s go to a bad one and make out .   
perhaps ,  you would like me to turn like this ,   so that you can bunny bump against my back .  
 hey !  
hey .  
hey ,  man .  what &apos;s up ?  
maybe you can tell me .  my agent would like to know why i didn &apos;t show up at the audition i didn &apos;t know i had today .  the first good thing she gets me in weeks .  how could you not give me the message ?  !  
well ,  i &apos;ll tell ya i do enjoy guilt ,  but ,  ah ,  it wasn &apos;t me .  
yes ,  it was !  it was him !  uh huh !   okay ,  it was me !  
how is it you ?  
well ,  it was just ,  it was all so crazy ,  you know .  i mean ,  chandler was in the closet ,  counting to 10 ,  and he was up to 7 and i hadn &apos;t found a place to hide yet .  i - i - i meant to tell you ,  and i wrote it all down on my hand .  see ,  all of it .   
yep ,  that &apos;s my audition .  
see ,  now this is why i keep notepads everywhere .  
yep ,  and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t invite you to play .  
what is the great tragedy here ?  you go get yourself another appointment .  
well ,  estelle tried ,  you know .  the casting director told her that i missed my chance .  
that is unfair .  i &apos;ll call her and tell her it was totally my fault .  
pheebs ,  you can &apos;t do that .  the casting director doesn &apos;t talk to friends ,  she only talks to agents .  
what a sad little life she must lead .  okay ,  ooh  .  
what ,  what are you doing ?  what are you doing ?  
no ,  no ,  no ,  i know ,  i know ,  ooh .    &apos;hi ,  this is katelynn ,  from phoebe buffay &apos;s office .  um ,  is um ,  ann there for phoebe ,  she &apos;ll know what it &apos;s about .  &apos; 
hang up ,  hang up .   
  &apos;annie !  hi .  listen we got a problem with joey tribbiani ,  apparently he missed his audition .  who did you speak to in my office ?  estelle ,  no ,  i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m going to do with her .  no .  all right ,  so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment ,  the world does not stop .  &apos; 
is anybody else scared ?  
  &apos;right ,  well look ,  um ,  if joey loses this audition ,  that is it for estelle .  i don &apos;t care !  annie you are a doll ,  what time can you see him ?  &apos;  i need a pen .   
get the woman a pad !  get the woman a pad !  a pad !  a pad !  
there &apos;s my boy !  here &apos;s my boy !  and here &apos;s his barbi  what &apos;s ah ,  what &apos;s my boy doing with a barbi ?  
he picked it out of the toy store himself ,  he loves it .  
he carries it everywhere ,  it &apos;s like a security blanket ,  but with ski boots and a kicky beret .  
yeah ,  it &apos;s ,  it &apos;s ,  it &apos;s cute .  why ,  why ,  why does he have it ,  again ?  
so he &apos;s got a doll ?  so what ?  unless you &apos;re afraid he &apos;s gonna grow up and be in show business .  
this doesn &apos;t have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women ,  does it ?  
you know what it &apos;s fine .  if you &apos;re okay with the barbi thing ,  so am i .   
give daddy the barbi !  ben ,  give ,  give me the barbi .  okay ,  how  &apos;bout ,  don &apos;t you want to play with the monster truck ?   no .  okay ,  oh ,  oh ,  how about a dino - soilder ?

what &apos;s the big deal ?  why don &apos;t you wanna see janice ?  
okay ,  last night at dinner ,  when the meals came ,  she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes .  
and that &apos;s bad because .  .  .  ,  you hate chicken piccata ?  
noo .  
you didn &apos;t want to share your tomatoes ,  tomatoes are very important to you .  
no ,  it &apos;s like all of the sudden ,  we were this couple .  and this alarm 
men are unbelievable .  
what is it with you people !  i mean ,  the minute you start to feel something ,  you have to run away ?  
i know ,  that ,   that &apos;s why i don &apos;t want to go tonight ,  i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m going to say something stupid .  
oh ,  you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you .  
hey ,  you know about that ?  !  
look what do i do ?  i wanna get past this ,  i don &apos;t wanna be afraid of the commitment thing .  i wanna go through the tunnel ,  to the other side !   
 where there is no fear of commitment .  
do we have any .  .  .  do we have any thoughts here ?  
well ,  i &apos;ve never been through the tunnel myself ,   &apos;cause as i understand it ,  you &apos;re not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car ,  right .  but ,  it seems to me it &apos;s pretty much like anything else ,  you know ,  face your fear .  it have a fear of heights ,  you go to the top of the building !  if you &apos;re afraid of bugs .  .  .  .  . get a bug .  right .  in this case ,  you have a fear of commitment ,  so i say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was .  
amazingly ,  that makes sense .  
you think ?  
oh ,  yeah .  go for it man ,  jump off the high dive ,  stare down the barrel of the gun ,  pee into the wind !  
oh ,  it &apos;s your audition from this morning .  can i use the phone again ?  
sure pheebs ,  you know ,  that &apos;s what it &apos;s there for ,  emergencies and pretend agents .  
come on baby ,  come on !  
  &apos;hi ,  i have phoebe buffay returning a page .  okay ,  well ,  um ,  she &apos;s in her car i &apos;ll have to patch you through .  &apos; 
very nice touch .  
  &apos;okay ,  go ahead .  &apos;  um ,  hi annie .   fantastic !   you got it .   oh ,  okay ,  um ,   &apos;will he work for scale ?  &apos; you ask me .  well ,  i don &apos;t know about that ,   except that i do and he will .  great ,  oh you are such a sweetheart .  i would love to have lunch with you ,  how about we have lunch next .  .  .  .  op ,  went through a tunnel .  
unbelievable .  
thank you so much .  
it was really fun ,  i mean i &apos;ve never talked on a car phone before .  
you were amazing ,  could you just do me this huge favor ,  you see there &apos;s this one other audition that i really ,  really want ,  and estelle couldn &apos;t get me in .  
oh ,  i don &apos;t know .  i mean it was fun one time .  
come on ,  please ,  it &apos;ll be just this one more ,  well actually it &apos;s two .  
two ?  
yeah !  well ,  well really it &apos;s three .  please .  you &apos;re so good at it .  i love you .  
okay ,  i &apos;ll do it ,  but just these three ,  right 
so ,  how come you wanted to eat in tonight ?  
 &apos;cause ,  i wanted to uh ,  give you this .   
ohhh ,  are you a puppy !   contact paper !  i never really know what to say when someone you &apos;re sleeping with gives you contact paper .  
well ,  wait there &apos;s ,  there &apos;s more .  see the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer .   see ,  the drawer actually goes in my dresser .  
oh ,  you didn &apos;t have to do this .  
yes ,  i did .  yes ,  i did .  because ,  you &apos;re my girlfriend ,  and that &apos;s what girlfriends should ,  should get .  
well ,  i gotta buy a vowel .  because ,  oh my gawd !  who ,  would &apos;ve thought that someday ,  chandler bing would buy me a drawer .  
well ,  not me .  but that &apos;s what &apos;s happened ,  and ,  ah ,  and ,  and there &apos;s more .  we should take a trip .  
we should ?  
yep ,  we &apos;re a couple and that &apos;s what couples do .  and ,  i wanna meet your parents .  we should take a trip with your parents !  
 i don &apos;t think we need to ,  because you &apos;re tripping me out right now !  are you okay ?  
i am ,  i actually am .  i mean this is amazing .  my entire life i have feared this place ,  and now that i &apos;m here it &apos;s like what was the big deal .  i could probably say  &apos;let &apos;s move in together .  &apos; and i &apos;d be okay .  
you probably want us to move in together ?  
it doesn &apos;t scare me !  
yeah ,  well ,  it scares me !  i mean i not even divorced yet ,  chandler .  you know ,  you just invited me over here for pasta ,  and all of the sudden you &apos;re talking about moving in together .  and ,  and i wasn &apos;t even that hungry .  you know what ,  it &apos;s getting a little late ,  and i - i should just ,  um .  .  .  
honey ,  this will help .   
so ,  i finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down .  
that is never good .  
then i got all needy and clingy .  
okay ,  wait a minute ,  wait a minute ,  wait a minute .  maybe it &apos;s not so bad .  how did you leave it ?  
she said she &apos;d call me .  
oh god .  
welcome to our side of the tunnel .  
this ice cream tastes like crap by the way .  
yeah ,  well that &apos;s that lo - cal ,  non dairy ,  soy milk junk .  we sort of ,  we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases .  
you know ,  when you start get screwed over all the time ,  you gotta switch to low - fat .  
yeah ,  you do .  
so ,  you don &apos;t think i &apos;m terminal ?  
well ,  no ,  not at all ,  you &apos;re not terminal ,  you just ,  you just need some damage control .  
okay ,  okay .  so ,  should i call her ?  
this is a very critical time right now .  if you feel yourself reaching for that phone ,  then you go shoe shopping ,  you get your butt in a bubble bath .  you want her back you have to start acting aloof .  
she has to know that your not ready .  
right .  so ,  what you have to do is ,  you have to accidentally run into her on purpose .  and then act aloof .  
so i &apos;m not ,  not gonna lose her ?  
oooh ,  honey ,  you &apos;re not a total loser .  
i said ,   &apos;so i &apos;m not gonna lose her ?  &apos; 
guess who &apos;s here .  it &apos;s the toughest guy in toy land ,  ben .    &apos;a real american hero .  i &apos;m g . i .  joe !  &apos; drop the barbi ,  drop the barbi .  
g . i .  joe ?  do you really think he &apos;s gonna fall for that ?  
 g .  i .  joe !  cool !  can i play ?  
look ben ,  it &apos;s a toy that protects u . s .  oil interests overseas !  
 helloo !  oh !   
pheebs !  there you are !  
no it &apos;s not ,  sorry .  
but phoebe ,  wait !  wait !  phoebe .  phoebe !   
oh ,  joey !  oh ,  okay ,  see i didn &apos;t recognize you wearing ,  in those .  .  .  . pants .  
look listen ,  that tv movie i went in for ?  did you hear anything ?  i think i got a shot at it .  
yes !  they called and you didn &apos;t get it !  okay ,  i mean you didn &apos;t get it ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  i &apos;m sorry .  
it &apos;s okay ,  these things happen .  
but they shouldn &apos;t happen ,  you know what ,  you &apos;re ,  you &apos;re in a terrible ,  terrible business .  oh god ,  i don &apos;t wanna be the person who makes your face look like that .  
i &apos;m ,  i &apos;m okay .  see .   
oh ,  now you &apos;re sad and creepy ,  oh .  you know what ,  i ,  i &apos;m sorry i quit ,  okay ,  i just quit .  
no !  no ,  no you can &apos;t quit !  you &apos;re the best agent i ever had !  look pheebs ,  rejection is part being an actor ,  you can &apos;t take it personally .  
not personal ,  really ,  well they said that they never met an italian actor with a worse italian accent .  
they actually said that ?  
yeah .  ooh god ,  there &apos;s that face again !  see i can &apos;t do this job !  i .  .  .  
no ,  no ,  no ,  see that &apos;s why you have to do this job ,  agents always lie .  you know ,  estelle just says stuff like  &apos;they went another way &apos; ,  but this ,  i can use this .   i canna work on a new accent .  
yeah okay ,  no if it helps you okay .  yeah .  
 no ,  thank you .   chandler !  
 hello ,  janice .  
what are you doing here ?

 chelsea .  
okay ,  you know ,  one of two things is happening here .  either you &apos;re seeing somebody behind my back ,  which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet .  or ,  else you &apos;re pretending that you &apos;re seeing somebody ,  which just makes you so pathetic that i could start crying right here in the cereal aisle .  so like which of these two guys do you want to be ?

look ,  it &apos;s okay ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  really ,  look um ,  i really appreciate this pheebs ,  but i think i &apos;m gonna have to go back to estelle .  
oh .  
yeah ,  well don &apos;t get me wrong ,  you &apos;re a better agent than she is ,  but at least with her i don &apos;t want to blow my pretty dumb brains out .  
yeah ,  no ,  i understand .  
you do ,  thanks .  
yeah .  sorry .   
wait a minute .  
what ?  
wait a minute ,  did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent .

gunther ,  gunther ,  please ,  ive worked here for two and a half years ,  i know the empty trays go over there .   
what if you put them here .   
huh .  well ,  y &apos;know thats actually a really good idea ,  because that way theyll be closer to the mugs .  y &apos;know what ,  you should have the other waitresses do that too .  
they already do .  thats why they call it the tray spot .

i wish .  no .  after dinner ,  me ,  her ,  and pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire .  well i woke up in the middle of the night and i saw that the fire was dying out .  so ,  i picked up a log and threw it on .  or ,  at least what i thought was a log .

okay ,  all right dont judge me to much .  okay ?  um ,  but i saw this info - mercial ,  and um ,  i swear to you i have never - ever bought anything on tv before ,  except for this mop .  but there was this stuff on leg waxing ,  it just ,  it looked so amazing .  .  .  .  
waxine !  !  
yes !  have you seen it ?  
oh ,  its incredible !  i so want to be a waxine girl .  
i know !  !  
god .  do think it really doesnt hurt ?  cause how can they do that ?  
hello !  organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest !  
oh my god !  oh my god !  
yeah .  we figured when we couldnt find you ,  youd gone home to make up with rachel .  which is probably what you shoulda done .  huh ?  
you think ?  !  god ,  i ,  ah ,  im in hell .  i mean what ,  what am i gonna do ?  rachels all like ,  i love you and ,  and lets work on this .  and all i can think about is ,  what is she gonna do ?  what is she gonna say ?  when i tell her what i did .  
well ,  before we answer that ,  i think we should address the more important question .  how dumb are you ?  
what ?  !  look ,  were trying to rebuild a relationship here ,  right .  how am i supposed to do that here ,  without being totally honest with each other ?  
look ,  ross look ,  im on board about this totally honesty thing ,  i am ,  just not about stuff thats gonna get you in trouble .  
hes right .  nobodys gonna benefit ,  and youre just gonna hurt her .  
yeah ,  and there wont be a relationship left to rebuild .  
yeah ,  but dont you think .  .  .  .  
all right look ,  if you absolutely have to tell her ,  at least wait until the timings right .  and thats what deathbeds are for .  
yeah ,  okay .   
all right ,  okay ,  now ,  we just have to make sure she doesnt find out some other way .   did you think about the trail ?  
what trail ?  
 the trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it !   you always have to think about the trail !  
oh ,  i - i dont think theres any trail .  
 after applying the waxine and linen strips to leg number one ,  
did that !  
grasp one of the linen strips by its easy grab tab and pull it off in one quick pain free motion .  
okay .   ow !  !  !  !  !  ow - oh - oh !  
was it not pain - free ?  
no .  it was painful .  oh my god  ,  they should call it pain - zine ,  now with a little wax .  
huh ,  well ,  the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial dont seem to think its that bad .  
thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid .  but hey ,  y &apos;know if you dont believe me ,  please ,  by my guest .  
 ow - ow - ow - ow !  oh my god !  !  !  
 chloe ?  hi .  .  
is this about me taking your watch ?  
you took my watch ?  
im sorry ,  i do that .  
just you keep it ,  listen did you ,  did you tell anyone about us ?  
oh no .  i feel it isnt really anybodys business ,  y &apos;know .  
exactly .  so you didnt ,  didnt mention anything to issac right ?  
oh ,  well i tell issac everything .  
you tell ,  of course you do .  issac .  issac .  hey ,  issac .  issac ,  hi !  y &apos;know we havent actually met .  .  .  
you dog !  
yes ,  i suppose i am a dog .  but issac ,  see i - i happen to have a girlfriend .  
oh right ,  that rachel chick from the coffee place .  
yeah ,  thats the one .  listen ,  i dont want to hurt her .  
oh ,  hey ,  man i know ,  doesnt matter how much we love em ,  monogamy is too cruel a rule .  
yeah .  listen ,  can you keep this information to yourself ?  
aw ,  no problem dude .  y &apos;know we got to look out for each other .  were the same ,  you and me .  
actually ,  no ,  were not .  
yeah ,  we are .  
no ,  were not .  
yeah ,  we are .  
no ,  were not !  !  
okay ,  were not .  
right .  
but ,  we are .

gunther !  gunther .  gunther ,  please tell me you didnt say anything to rachel about me and the girl from the xerox place .

its okay ,  its okay .  
were all right .  
we were just waxing our legs .  
off ?  !  !  
for your information ,  this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience .  
yeah ,  well i dont think you can make that statement ,  unless youve been kicked in an area that god only meant to be treated nicely .  
yeah ,  i - i think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men ,  thats all .  i mean ,  come on ,  its just a little wax .  
oh yeah ,  come here .   
oh ,  thats mature .  
okay ,  fine ,  so now what ,  i just pull it off ?  
uh - huh .

im sorry ,  okay ,  im sorry .  i wa - i was disgusted with myself ,  and this morning i was so ,  i was so upset and then i got your message and i was so happy ,  and all i wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible .  
whoa !  !  whoa ,  whoa ,  wait a minute .  what time did your little friend leave ?   oh my god .  she was there ?  she was still there ?  she was in there ,  when i was in there ?  !   
listen .  oh hey ,  hey ,  the important thing was that she meant ,  she meant nothing to me !  
and yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship !  !   
look ,  i didnt think there was a relationship to jeopardise .  i thought we were broken up .  
we were on a break !  
that ,  for all i knew would ,  could last forever .  that to me is a break - up .  
you think youre gonna get out of this on a technicality ?  
look ,  im not trying to get out of anything ,  okay .  i thought our relationship was dead !  
well ,  you sure had a hell of a time at the wake !   
y &apos;know what ,  i dont think we should listen to this anymore .   
 what ,  what are you doing ?  you cant go out there .

anyway !  her and ross just started yelling at each other .  
wait .  why was he yelling at her ?  hes the one who slept with someone else .  
well ,  i guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened ,  that she should of forgiven him by now .  
whoa !  !  he is soo unreasonable !  god ,  although i think i understand what he means .  oh my god ,  this is like 60 minutes ,  okay ,  when ,  when ,  at first youre really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y &apos;know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow .  
y &apos;know what this is like ?  this is like when my parents got divorced .  man ,  i hope ross doesnt try to kidnap me after cub scouts .  
y &apos;know i had a dream where ross and rachel were still together ,  they never broke up .  and we were all just like hanging out ,  and everyone was happy .  .  .  .  
i had the same dream !

well ,  im really sick of your smoking ,  so i brought something that is going to help you quit .   
oh .   nope ,  that patch is no good .   
come on ,  its a hypnosis tape .  this woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasnt smoked since .  
pffhah .  
 whats your problem ?  
nothing ,  its just that hypnosis is beyond crap .  
ross ,  i watched you get hypnotised in atlantic city .  
hey ,  that guy did not hypnotise me !  okay .  
oh right ,  cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play wipe - out on your butt cheeks .  
all right ,  y &apos;know forget hypnosis .  the way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather ,  and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men .  
here you go .  
oh ,  y &apos;know what ,  i didnt want cinnamon on this .

y &apos;know ,  i mean ,  really we do realise that theres an age difference between us .  
oh good !  okay .  cause you were acting like you didnt .  
oh no ,  but when it comes to love ,  what does age matter ?   
and y &apos;know what ,  i just realised ,  in the last year ive only gone out with two guys ,  richard and julio .  you gotta help me out here ,  you gotta set me up ,  you gotta get me back in the game .

pheebs ,  what ,  is it the age thing ?  
no - no ,  oh ,  im fine with the age thing y &apos;know ,  until it starts sticking its tongue down my little brothers throat !  
pheebs ,  he seems to enjoy it .  
but ,  i mean ,  do you think hes gonna enjoy it when hes up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away ?  !  this is not fair to frank ,   and it - its not fair to the babies ,  and y &apos;know what ,  its not good home economics .  
well ,  have - have you told him how you feel ?  
yes .  not out loud .  
pheebs ,  if you dont tell him ,  soon hes gonna be married ,  and then youre gonna hate yourself .  
yeah ,  but if i do tell him ,  then hes gonna hate myself .  i mean look at him and his mom ,  i cant .   but ,  you guys can ,  please you gotta talk him out of it .  and turns them back to face her . )

well ,  they always called .

sophie ,  would you please climb out of my butt .  why hasnt he called ,  rachel ?  why ?

i just ,  i just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my mother .  
you mean the mom you met in montauk .  she was a cat ?  !  
no ,  no - no ,  she was a human lady .  this is the spirit of my mom lily ,  the one who killed herself .  
are you sure shes in the cat ,  or have you been taking your grandmas glycoma medicine again ?  
no dr .  skeptismo !  im sure .  first of all ,  okay ,  theres the feeling .   okay ,  and for another ,  how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt .   my mothers favourite fish is orange roughy .  .  .   cats .  .  .  . like .  .  .  . fish !   hi ,  mommy .   oh ,  i havent seen this smile in 17 years !

hey !  
umm ,  when were you gonna tell me that youre going out with chip matthews ?  
now ?  is it okay if i go out with chip matthews ?  
nooo !  its not okay !  i cant believe you would want to after what he did to me !  
what ,  that little thing at the prom ?  
monica !  i couldnt find him for two hours !  he was having sex with amy welch !  
come on ,  that was back in high school !  how could that still bother you ?  
i mean why ,  of all people would you want to go out with chip ?  !  
look ,  you and i went to different high schools .  .  .  
okay ,  that doesnt help me ,  because we went to the same high school .  
you went to one where you were popular ,  and you got to ride off chips motorcycle ,  and wear his letterman jacket .  i went to one where i wore a band uniform they had to have specially made .  
 they had to have that specially made ?  !  
it was a project for one of the home ec classes .  
 oh my god ,  they told us that was for the mascot !  
back then ,  i thought that i would never ,  ever get the chance to go out with a chip matthews ,  and now hes - hes called me up and asked me out .  and the fat girl inside of me really wants to go .  i - i owe her this .  i never let her eat .  
oh ,  you go out with him .   
oh ,  really ?  !  
yeah .  just ,  if its possible ,  could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy ?  
so you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center ?  
well ,  there were a couple of calls last night ,  but ah ,  i dont think any of them are gonna work out .  
yes ,  joey has a very careful screening process .  apparently ,  not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails .  
 stop it !  stop it !  she keeps squirming ,  trying to get away !  just like when she was alive .  
so pheebs ,  how long is your mom gonna be with us ?  
well ,  im not sure .  i mean ,  i guess until she y &apos;know ,  gets used to the fact that theres y &apos;know ,  a new mom .  y &apos;know ,  i think shes worried that y &apos;know ,  shes gonna ,  shes gonna be replaced .   well ,  thats not gonna happen is it ?  noo .   okay ,  i have to return a call in the other room .  
why cant you use the phone in here ?  
well ,  im returning a call from a certain mom at the b - e - a - c - h .  i just spelled the wrong word .   
so ,  guys ,  am i crazy ,  or does phoebes mom remind anyone of a cat ?  
ross ,  dont start .  
come on ,  you - you cant tell me you actually believe that - that theres a woman inside that cat !  
i believe it .

well ,  last time i almost got fired .  you must end it ,  you must end it now !  
oh ,  come on !  its not like this is an everyday occurrence for me !  i mean usually im pretty much just in there by myself .

hmm .  
why did you hire me ?  
oh ,  well richard raved about the food at his party ,  of course you were sleeping with him .  then i heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice ,  i assume you werent sleeping with anybody there .  though ,  at least that would be something .   
 oh my god !  did you hear that ?  she hired me because she thinks im good .  
okay ,  i didnt hear that .  
oh yeah ,  she didnt hire me out of pity ,  it wasnt so she could pick on me in front of her friends ,  she actually thinks im good .  
wow !  and hey ,  its cool if youre a lesbian !   
are you the decision maker of the house ?  
uhhhh .   
no !  no .  but ah ,  try the classifieds ,  people sell everything in there .  ask you one question .  do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though youre not really sure what theyre talking about ?    
im telling you its totally unconstituional .    
i think he deserves a nobel prize .   
nooo !  !    
it was like the algonquin kids table .    you havent said anything for about two and a half minutes ,  are you at all interested ?  
thats weird .

pay the caterer !  look ,  i &apos;ve had a lot of jobs ,  okay ,  and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying .  it &apos;s either ,  you know ,   &quot; that massage wasn &apos;t long enough ,  or ,   &quot; i don &apos;t recognize any of those songs ,  &quot;  or ,  you know ,   &quot; these sombreros aren &apos;t big enough .  bad little white girl !  &quot;  
okay .  so what do you .  .  .  .  you think she &apos;s faking ?

you obviously havent screwed over a lot of your friends .   which we all appreciate .  
no the - the sad thing is ,  if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her ,  knowing joey ,  he probably just wouldve just stepped aside .  
oh ,  dont say that !  dont say that .  thats not true .  is it ?  
i think maybe ,  yeah .  
he loves you .  
then why didnt you tell me to do that ?  !  !

yeah .  you know why ?  cause you came to me first .  
well ,  i thought that would be the best thing to do .  
but hey ,  listen just so you know ,  you might have youre work cut out for you .  cause when i talked to her ,  i kinda got the feeling that shes into some other guy .  so

is that why you bought all this stuff ?  !   well ,  yknow what i will not watch your tv ,  i will not listen to your stereo ,  and theres a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that im not gonna eat !  you know why ?  !  
probably because 
oh my god ,  hes lost it .  hes totally lost it .

so are things with you and joey any better ?  
they couldnt be worse .  i spent eight hours calling him last night ,  just trying to get him to talk to me .  
oh wow ,  eight hours ?  so you could probably really use one of those plug - in telephone headsets huh ?  
should we all expect christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office ?  
you shouldnt .  
speaking of christmas ,  umm since monica and i are starting a new business and have like no money ,  umm ,  this year maybe we could do secret santa ,  and then we each only buy one gift .  and - and theres the added mystery of who gets who .  
who gets whom .   i dont know why i do that .   
well ,  im gonna take a nap ,  turkey makes me sleepy .  
we havent eaten yet !  
i know ,  but all that work youre doing to get it ready ,  i just  
hey ,  by any chance did either of pick uh rachel for your secret santa ,  cause i wanna trade for her .  
i picked her !  oh thank god you want her !  ooh !  
wow !  why do you want to get rid of her so badly ?  
because she exchanges every gift she ever gets ,  its like impossible to get her something she likes .  come on ,  lets trade !  
oh thats not true !  thats not true !  i got her that backpack and she loved it !  i remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it  oh ,  there was no big dog .  all right this sucks !  i already got her this briefcase ,  and i had r . g .  put on it  her initials 
ohh .  
well ,  maybe you could give to somebody else .  ooh ,  like ross geller .  
op ,  y &apos;know what though ,  its kindve a girlie briefcase .  
who cares ?  he works in a museum !  
hey ,  what time is it ?  the big game is about to start !  
you dont have to do that ,  ross and joey arent here ,  you can watch the parade if you want .  
thanks .  
what is wrong with this freezer ?  !   ow !  ow !  !  
god ,  what happened ?  !  
oh my god ,  ice just got in my eye !  
 people are trying to sleep in here !  
monica got ice in her eye ,  and it hurts .  
open it up ,  let me see .  
oh ,  yknow what ,  i cant ,  it really kills .  
well maybe you should put some ice on it .  
ooh ,  god it looks bad .  
honey ,  maybe we should take you to a doctor .  
no ,  my eye doctor is richard !  i cant go to him when i dont have a boyfriend !  
hes really picky about his patients .  
honey ,  youve got to go .  whats his office number ?  
like i remember his office number !   speed dial 7 .  
 hi !  yeah ,  im calling on behalf of monica gellers eye ,  and is um ,  is richard burke in today .   hes out of town ,  but does she want to see the on - call doctor ?  
yes !  !  
yes !  shes very excited about that .   
this is so cool ,  til monica gets back ,  its like im head chef and i get to make all the decisions .   
hey - hey ,  i thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly !  
okay ,  get out of my kitchen !  
 all right !  okay !  i think i am making some progress with joey ,  when i went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once !   i mean yeah ,  he gave me the finger while doing it .  
all right i i gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question .  
so listen ah ,  i picked monica for secret santa ,  but im already getting her something for chanukah ,  i was wondering if you wanna switch .  
oh yknow what ,  i was already trying to trade for ah ,  well ,  you .  
really ?  !  wow !  thats - thats so nice ,  what are you gonna get me ?  
i dont know r . g .  ,  i was thinking something girlie for your office .  
yeah ,  well maybe phoebe will switch with me .  
oh no - no - no ,  you dont want to do that ,  then youre gonna get stuck with rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets .  
oh ,  thats not true !  ive got her lots of stuff she never took back .  
like ?  
like uh ,  that gold necklace i got her last year .  
when was the last time you saw her wear it ?  
well ,  she wore it all christmas day ,  and then uh 
 hey !  
hey !  
what are you doing ?  
im sending back all this stuff that chandler bought out of guilt .  
everything ?  even the tv ?  
no !  im putting that in my room .  
listen ,  joey ,  i know what he did was wrong but dont you think you could at least hear the guy out ?  
back when you and rachel were together ,  if chandler had kissed her ,  would you hear him out ?  
thats a good point .  so uh ,  how long are you gonna punish him ?  
five years .  
youve sentenced him ?  !  
hey !  dont do the crime if you cant do the time .  
joey ,  the guys your best friend .  
no ,  was my best friend .  anyway ,  i dont know why youre pushing for him so hard .  with him out of the way as my best friend ,  theres a spot open .  
oh ,  who ?  me ?  
yeah !  
wow !  im honored !  and yknow what im gonna do as my first act as your best friend ?  
what ?  
im gonna get you to talk to chandler .  
oh my god ,  is it really that bad ?  
i walk into a room and he wont even talk to me ,  he just mumbles something in italian .  and i know he only knows the bad words .  
 hey gunther ,  have you uh ,  have you seen chandler ?  
i thought you were chandler .  but umm ,  one of who is over there .   
oh .  
hey joe .  
ill be right with you .  okay ?   thanks ,  wendy .  
oh my god !  how cute is the on - call doctor ?

dr .  burke will see you know .  
oh no - no - no ,  not dr .  burke .  dr .  burke is out of town .  the - the on - call doctor will see me now .  
hey !  im sorry !  that where are you going ?  
my folks .  
oh ,  uh ,  when - when are you coming back ?  
i dont know .  i might stay there for a few days while i look for an apartment .  
what ?  !  
yeah ,  yknow at first i thought we could talk about this yknow ,  work it out ,  but uh ,  seeing you two together i dont think i 
hey ,  look ,  what do you want me to say ?  do you want me to say that ill stop seeing her ?  
look ,  its not about her .  okay ?  but seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did .  and i dont want to live with some one who doesnt know what it is to be a friend .  so ,  ill see ya .   
hey ,  look ,  i know what it is to be a friend ,  i just - i just screwed up !  
yeah !  you did !  and thats why im leaving .   
all right look ,  if youre not gonna stay for me ,  then at least stay for them !  okay ,  they have had a very difficult year !  what with the robbery and all !  
when that guy was robbing us ,  and i was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours ,  you know what i was doing in there all that time ?  i was thinking about how i let you down !  
what ?  
yeah !  but if wouldve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be ,  i wouldnt have worried about it so much !  see you around !  
all right ,  wait !  come on !  just wait one second !  there has to be something that i can do !  something !  if we still had that entertainment unit i would get in it for six hours and think about how i let you down .   what ?  
last time i saw you ,  it was the morning i left for college .  and you were just standing outside the dairy queen .  
i was probably waiting for it to open .  
i gotta tell you ,  you look great now .  
you look great too .  
youre an excellent patient !  
so how does it look ?  
well ,  youve got a little scratch on your cornea ,  your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days .  
like a pirate ?  !  
if that helps you .  
umm ,  so how long have you been working with your dad ?   come on ,  one of us had to mention him .  
i moved back here a couple of months ago .  
oh .  big family dinner tonight ?  
uh .   
no way !  
i was gonna have thanksgiving at my girlfriends .  
 oh .  
but we broke up .  
 oh .  
she - she wasnt ready for a serious commitment .  
 oh .   so you made her walk the plank ?  aye ,  matie ?  
youre not wearing the patch yet .  
hes coming here for thanksgiving !  
i know ,  its sick .  
why is it sick ?  
because its richards son !  its like inviting greek tragedy over for dinner !  
hey ,  come on ,  phoebe ,  you understand dont you ?  
yeah ,  i can see where id be your best shot but ,  no .  im sorry ,  but i think its twisted .  
yeah .  
 whats twisted ?  
me going out with richards son .  
ewwwww !  !  ew !  ew !  ew !  
 sounds like a really bad idea to me .  
is he okay in there ?  
hes fine !  
hey ,  y &apos;know ,  mon ,  if things wrong out between you and richards son ,  youd be able to tell your kids ,  that you slept with their grandfather .  
fine !  judge all you want to but ,   married a lesbian ,   left a man at the altar ,   fell in love with a gay ice dancer ,   threw a girls wooden leg in a fire ,   livin in a box !  !   
so now ,  what exactly is the point of the box ?  
chandler ?  
the meaning of the box is three fold .  one  ,  it gives me the time to think about what i did .  two  ,  it proves how much i care about my friendship with joey .  and three  ,  it hurts !  
 oh hey !  hey uh ,  you remember the necklace i gave you last year ?  can i see it ?  
 why ?  
i just wanna check something .  
okay .   
 now ,  well see .  
air hole !  air hole !  !

 the necklace i got you was gold ,  this one is silver .  
huh ,  well maybe it uh ,  it changed .

okay ,  fine .    
you cant tell ,  but im trying to break the tension by mooning you guys !  
all right ,  look !  if this is just a big joke to you ,  then forget about it ,  all right ?  !  this means something to me !  and if it doesnt mean anything to you ,  then you should get out of there ,  otherwise youre just an idiot in a box !  
youre right ,  and im sorry !  this means a lot to me !  i want you to be my friend again !  i swear ,  i wont say another word tonight .  
so are you gonna start taking this thing seriously ?

dont say that i have no sentiment !   this is a movie stub from our first date !  this is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed !   this is from the museum from the first time we were together .  okay ,  maybe i exchange gifts sometimes ,  but i keep the things that matter !  
i dont know what to say ,  im sorry .  though ,  youre not supposed to take these .   its like a million years old ,  we ,  we actually ,  we had people looking for that .

people can hear you .

that is one good looking man !  
is it just me ,  or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat ?  !  
no ,  youre my first .  put the money on the table .   harder . ) 
dude !  
if you want it to be .   
oh ,  hey ,  mon ,  do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school ?  
yeah ,  i think i have some around here somewhere .  why ?  
well ,  its just that maternity clothes are so expensive .   
hey ,  rach !  i made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room .  if you could just  throw your purses at it .  
bloomingdales eliminated my department .   
oh my god ,  are you out of a job ?  
no ,  but they stuck me in personal shopping .  which is just a huge step down !  
personal shopping ?  what is that ?  like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy ?  
uh - huh .  
that sounds great !  
 hey !   
umm ,  excuse me ,  we switched apartments .  you cant eat are food anymore ,  that - that gravy train had ended .  
 theres gravy ?  
if you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time .  that fridge has got to be stocked ,  okay ,  thats your department now .    
what are you doing ?  
hey !  
hey !  
hey !  
ooh !  how was kathys play ?  
well ,  kathy gets half - naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin guy .  
yeah ,  its like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it !  
thats a good idea for a business !  
im totally screwed .  okay ,  they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night ,  and then theyre gonna go to their cast parties and hes gonna try to undermine me .  y &apos;know itll be like ,   &quot; so wheres your boyfriend ,  whats - his - name ,  chester ?  &quot;  and shell go ,   &quot; no - no - no ,  its chandler .  &quot;  and hell go ,   &quot; whatever .  ha - ha - ha - ha !  &quot;  
 that - that is a good trick .  
all right ,  look ,  look ,  what am i gonna do ?  
chandler ,  look theyre actors .  theyre there to do a job ,  just cause they work together ,  doesnt mean theyre gonna get together .  i mean just cause it happened with susan sarandon and tim robbins ,  it doesnt mean its gonna happen with them .  
oh - oh ,  alec baldwin and kim basinger .  
tom cruise and nicole kidman .  
yeah .  
hey ,  mel gibson and clint eastwood .  
theyre not a couple !  
oh - okay ,  i get the game now .  
okay look ,  look ,  let me ask you a question ,  when they were doing it on stage ,  was it like really hot ?  
oh yeah !  
well okay ,  so then youre fine .  the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off - stage all the sexual tension between them is gone .  okay ?  so as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about .  its when the heat goes away ,  thats when youre in trouble .  
really ?  
look ,  you guys have been to every play ive ever been in ,  have i ever had chemistry on stage ?  
no .  
so uh ,  man ,  are you gonna go to the play with me tonight ?  
yknow what ,  i dont know how comfortable i am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend .  
yeah ,  i know but 
oh no - no - no ,  im there .  
 hey !  
hey mon !  want some pancakes ?  
you made pancakes ?  
yep !  grab a plate .  
okay .   
no - no ,  stay right there .   gettin closer .  
okay ,  okay ,  but dont worry ,  because we also have cereals ,  muffins ,  waffles ,  and ,  jams ,  jellies ,  and marmalades .  which im fairly certain are the same thing .

oh yeah !  
oh ,  i was thinking about having people over for the game .  
oh yeah ,  whos playing ?

somebody seems to be missing being the hostess .  
 please ,  its a relief is what it is ,  is what it is .  
all right pheebs ,  stick out your plate !

oh - oh ,  sorry ,  its this way ,  its this way .   
im right !  right ?  there was like no chemistry between them .  before they had heat ,  and now theres no heat !  now you know what this means ,  joey told us what this means !  
all right ,  lets not jump to any conclusions .  all right ?  there was some sexual chemistry between them .  
come on ,  it was like cousins having sex up there !  
here she comes .  dont say a word ,  okay ?  just be cool ,  dont be y &apos;know you .  
hey you guys !

it is not over !  youre over !  
what ?  
you know !  
okay .   good one .  
it is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you .  and the reason why she couldnt ,  is because her feelings were so strong ,  it scared her .  now you go home and wait for her call ,  she could be calling you from the plane !  come on now go !  go !   
okay !  okay !  but if she doesnt call ,  it is definitely over !  no ,  wait .  wait .  unless ,  eventually ,  i call her ,  yknow just to she whats going on ,  and ,  and she says shell call me back ,  but then she doesnt .  then its over .

whats the second part of your plan ?  
 hello ?  
ross .  
emily ,  hi !  uh ,  how - how was you flight ?  
it was dreadful .  i felt terrible about how i acted when you said those wonderful things .

ross umm ,  theres something that ive got to tell you ,  theres - theres someone else .  
she doesnt know which one of us she wants ,  me or this colin guy .  
this isnt how its supposed to go ,  there cant be another guy .  
well 
of course theres another guy !  !  this is even more perfect !  now you have to prove your love !  
im not proving anything .  okay ,  im done listening to you .  if i hadnt let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place ,  i never wouldve put my fist through the wall !  
you put your fist through the wall ?  
no ,  i missed and hit the door .  but ,  it opened really hard !  
you have to go to london !  
what ?  
yeah ,  you have to go fight for her !  
oh yeah ,  sure ,  that makes sense .  yeah .  cause you already told her you love her and she didnt say it back ,  then she called you and told you that theres another guy ,  so yeah ,  go to london thatll scare her !

i made fun of his accent .  
you sat back and let him have her ,  you didnt fight at all .  am i right ?  do you want the same thing to happen with emily ?

well ,  h - how is this like that ?  
well ,  lets see ,  its not .  really ,  like that .  because ,  you see that was an actual problem ,  and uh ,  yours is just like yknow a bunch of yknow high school crap that nobody really gives yknow 
 im - im sorry ,  i just thought that 
ugh !  i dont know what im going to do !  i called the company that sent and th - they dont care !  then i called 9 - 1 - 1 and they laughed at me ,  if this isnt an emergency ,  then what is ?  
 hey guys !

i just wanted to thank you again for last night ,  what a great party !  and the guys from work had a blast .  yknow ,  one of them had never been to a bachelor party before .  yeah !  and - and another one had never been to a party before ,  so 
so uh ,  hey ,  that uh ,  that wedding ring ,  huh ?  man ,  thats nice !  
yeah ,  right !  
i was uh ,  i was thinking i might want to pick one of those babies up for myself ,  i might want to get one of those 
that ring ?  when my grandmother first came to this country ,  that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her .  
so you might say ,  the ring is irreplaceable ?   
oh absolutely !  it has been in my family for generations ,  and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life .  
so you might say ,  its a magic ring .  
 yeah ,  the stripper stole it .  
my - my ring ?  my - my wedding ring ?  the - the stripper stole my wedding ring ?  !  h - how ?  !  how could this all happen ?  !  
well ,  i think it all started when you said ,   &quot; hey joey ,  why dont you be my best man .  &quot;  
 all right - all right ,  fine !  i - im gonna call the cops !  
dude ,  i screwed up ,  you dont have to turn me in !  
not on you !  on the stripper !  
oh ,  yeah ,  well i already did that !  they said theyre gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders .  
okay ,  well ,  well call the company that sent her !  
i did that too !  they wouldnt give me her real name or her number .  they said ,   &quot; if i bothered them again theyd call the police .  &quot;  i said ,   &quot; if you talk to the police ,  you tell them im missing a ring !  &quot;  
so what ,  joey ?  wh - wh - what ?  what are you telling me ?  that theres nothing we can do ?  well ,  how could this happen ?  !

thanks .  
hello ?  
hey !  i just spoke to your dad ,  and you know what ?  he seems to think well be able to find a new place for the wedding .  
we dont have to .  
whoa - whoa - what ?  you found a place ?  
no .  but ,  monica and i were talking ,  and - and i was so upset about the hall being knocked down ,  and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit .  
she said what ?  
she said ,   &quot; if im not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day ,  well then we should just postpone it .  &quot;  
postpone it ?  emily ,  do you think monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding ?  do you my sisters teeny - tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here ,  huh ?   this isnt right .  
i realize that people are going to be disappointed .  but ,  im sure theyll come back when we can do it right .  
i cant ask people to do that ?  would you ask people to do that ?   
dont you point your pants at me !   we have no choice !  anywhere thats half - decent wouldve be booked months ago ,  ross dont you understand ?  this is our wedding im talking about .  
the only thing i understand is; postponing it is not an option .  this is when were getting married .  
so what are you saying ?  its now or never ?  
no .  im saying its now .   
or ?  
theres no or in mind .  what is wrong with these pants ?  !  !  
its not the pants .  its you that is backwards .  and if ,  and if you dont understand how important this is to me ,  well then ,  perhaps we shouldnt get married at all !   
hey !  
 hi .  
so ,  did shopping make you feel any better about ross ?  
manhattan does not have enough stores .  
well ,  i think i can help you get over him .  
you can ?  
yeah .  i just need you to bring me some photos of ross .  
um - hmm .  
and a small piece of chocolate .  
okay .  
and a glass of tepid water .   
ooh ,  is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north - facing tree ?  
uh ,  only if you have the hiccups too .  yeah ,  the pictures are for you ,  the water and the chocolate is for me .  i just didnt feel like getting up .  okay ,  im gonna show you a picture of ross .  okay ?  and youre going to remember all of the bad things about him .  all right ?  really focus on his flaws .  
i can do that .  i certainly did it when we were going out .  
okay .  umm ,  before we get started ,  i just wanna say for the record that i love ross ,  i think hes such a great guy .  here .   okay ,  now ,  close your eyes .  and imagine that youre with ross okay and imagine that youre kissing him .  and youre - youre running your hands all over his body .  and then you run your hands through his hair ,  but eew - oh gross its some kind of grease ,  itsuck !  hah ?  
i dont know ,  his uh ,  his hair never really bothered me that much ,  and yknow it was always more crunchy than it was greasy .  
okay ,  this is going to be harder than i thought .  umm ,  lets try some uh ,  aversion therapy .  
okay .  
okay ?  
all right .  
so uh ,  now look at the picture 
okay .  
all right ,  and umm  
ow !  
okay ,  how do you feel now ?  
hey .  
hey .   
oh .   sorry !  
no - no - no ,  yknow what ?  i really shouldnt have said that you were embarrassing me ,  i mean that really wasnt cool .  and if it makes you feel any better ,  ive had a really lousy day .  
me too .  
yeah ?

she said that ?  !  
yeah .  
why ?  !  
i dont know ,  i told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out .  
oh my god .  youre even dumber than i am !  
excuse me ?  
ross ,  how long have you been planning this wedding ?  
i dont know .  a month ?  
emily has probably been planning it since she was five !  ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head .  thats what we did !  we dreamed about the perfect wedding ,  and the perfect place ,  with the perfect four - tiered wedding cake  ,  with the little people on top .   thanks .  but the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was .  
i had no idea .  and that - that pillowcase thing ,  i thought you guys were just doing the flying nun .  
sometimes we were .  
come on .  you gotta help me figure out what to do .  okay ?  
okay .  
come on .   
that was pretty intense huh ?  
yeah .   hey ,  i hope ross didnt think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here !  
hello .  
 hey ,  pheebs !  its joey !  
hey ,  joey !  hey !  ooh !  ooh !  i just say someone on thethat looks just like you on the subway .  and i was gonna go over and say hi !  but then i figured ,  he doesnt care if he looks like you .  
that just cost me four bucks .  but uh listen ,  i just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing ?  
ohh ,  theyre having a great time with their aunt phoebe !  aunt rachel hasnt been helpful at all .  so ,  do you miss me ?

monica ,  why have you brought me here of all places ?  !  
youll see .

and the musicians ,  look ,  they can go over here  ,  okay ?  and the chairs can face this way  ,  and  you go .

irachel ,  you cant go !  ross loves emily !  
yeah ,  i know ,  i know ,  i know he does .  but i have to tell him how i feel !  he deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision .  
thats not why youre going !  youre going because you hope hes gonna say ,   &quot; yeah ,  i love you too ,  rach .  forget that british chippy .  &quot;  
ohhdo you think he will ?  !

it &apos;s london ,  baby !  all right ,  the hotel &apos;s here .   wait .  no ,  we wanna go .  .  .  no .  i know .   i &apos;m gonna have to go into the map .

i got it !   here we go .  
okay .  listen - listen ,  we &apos;re not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we ?  
 .  .  . and that was all before 10 o &apos;clock .  the caterer rang and said it was going to be chicken kiev instead of chicken tarragon .  and then the florist phoned to say there aren &apos;t any tulips .  oh ,  and the chilliest has carpel - tunel syndrome .  we &apos;re not gonna be .  .  .  
whoa - whoa - whoa !  emily ,   honey ,  okay ?

sorry .  
sweetie ,  you gotta relax .  everything &apos;s gonna be great ,  okay ?  come on .  come on .  
chicken kiev ?  
um - hmm !  doesn &apos;t that sound delicious at the last minute ?  
yeah ,  y &apos;know ,  but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken .  and ,  you wouldn &apos;t have to worry about the salmonella .   but of course with salmon you &apos;d have to worry about the chickenella .  .  .  so ,  i can &apos;t wait to see this place you &apos;re getting married !  
yeah .  yeah .  yes ,  this place is beautiful .  emily &apos;s parents got married here .  
i still can &apos;t believe they &apos;re tearing it down .  it really is the most lovely building you &apos;ll ever see .  i mean it &apos;s over .  .  .   oh my god !  
it &apos;s nice .  
oh .  oh .    
 oh .  oh my god .  how can this be happening ?  what are we going to do ?  
it &apos;s all right !  everything &apos;s gonna be all right .  
how &apos;s it gonna be all right ?  !  
uh - huh ,  i see that .  
 okay ,  i talked to the guy with the shovel and i found out what happened .  
what ?  what ?  
all right !  westminster abbey !  hands down ,  best abbey i &apos;ve ever seen .  hey !   okay .  what do you think of the abbey ,  chandler ?  
i think it &apos;s great .  it &apos;s great .  y &apos;know ,  they &apos;re thinking of changing the name of this place .  
really ?  to what ?  
to put the camera away !  !  !  
don &apos;t worry .  you &apos;ll find some place to get married .   
oowww !  !  
sorry .  lucky this dress is red !  
we can &apos;t find another place .  then we can &apos;t have the wedding !  i &apos;ve ordered chicken and salad and - and cake for 150 .  what should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just sunday with a spectacular amount of food !  
you &apos;re gonna find a place .  but even if  -  god forbid  -  you didn &apos;t .  .  so you postpone the wedding .  is that really so bad ?  i mean ,  think about it .  you could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want .  you could have tulips ,  you could have salmon .  .  .  .  mmmmm .  .  .  salmon !  !  
i suppose it wouldn &apos;t be the end of the world .  .  .  oh ,  thank you !  
but either way .  .  .  you &apos;re gonna get married ,  you &apos;re gonna be happy ,  my mom &apos;s gonna like you better than me .   
oh .  oh .  
oh ,  honey !  don &apos;t get up !  what do you need ?  
oh ,  no .  oh ,  nothing .  
come on !  i am here to take care of you !  what do you need ?  anything .  
okay ,  i have a wedgie .  
okay ,  that is all you .  
so - so ,  what do you want for lunch ?  
oh ,  i don &apos;t know .  i guess we have to eat .  
yeah ,  i do .  what &apos;s the matter ?  
i &apos;m just bummed about the way i left things with ross .  i shouldn &apos;t have lied to him about having to work .  he seemed so mad at me .  
eh ,  don &apos;t be so hard on yourself .  if someone i was still in love with was getting married .  .  .  
 still in love with ?  !  
yeah !  
i &apos;m not in love with ross !  
oh .  no .  no .  good !  yeah ,  me neither .  
phoebe ,  i &apos;m going to ross &apos;s wedding because he is my ex - boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable .  not because ,  i &apos;m still in love with him !  i mean ,  hey ,  y &apos;know ,  i like ross as much as the next guy ,  y &apos;know ?  clearly i have feelings for him ,  but feelings don &apos;t mean love !  i mean ,  i still have loving feelings for ross .  yeah !  but ,  i have ,  i have continuing feelings of love ,  but that doesn &apos;t mean that - that i &apos;m still in love with him .  y &apos;know ?  i - i have sexual feelings for him ,  but i do love him - ohh !  oh my god !  oh my - why didn &apos;t you tell me ?  !  !  
we thought you knew !  
we ?  !  
yeah ,  we all know !  we talk about it all the time !  
you all know ?  does ross know ?  
oh no ,  ross doesn &apos;t know anything .  
oh ,  i can not believe you didn &apos;t tell me !  
well ,  because we thought you knew !  !  it &apos;s so obvious !  god ,  that would be like telling monica ,   &quot; hey ,  you like things clean .  &quot;  or ,  y &apos;know ,   &quot; hey ,  joey ,  you &apos;re gay .  &quot;   
what ?  !  
hey !  post cards .  .  .  
check this out ?  huh ?   yeah .  that &apos;s the stuff .  what do you think ?  
well ,  i don &apos;t have to buy that ,   &quot; i &apos;m with stupid &quot;  t - shirt anymore .  
well ,  i like it .  here you go .   
all right ,  look ,  you &apos;re not really gonna buy that are you ?  don &apos;t you think you &apos;ve embarrassed me enough for one day ?  
oh ,  i embarrass you ?  
how can i answer that when i &apos;m pretending i don &apos;t know you ?  
oh really ?  then how come no one here is wearing them ?  
all right ,  look ,  if you insist on wearing that ,  in public ,  y &apos;know ,  you &apos;re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself .  
oh yeah ?   if you &apos;re gonna make me choose between you and the hat ?  i choose the hat .  
thanks .  
okay ,  wait .  all right ,  that &apos;s it ,  okay ,  i &apos;m out of here .  i am not going to be embarrassed anymore !    
hello ?  
hey !  i just spoke to your dad ,  and you know what ?  he seems to think we &apos;ll be able to find a new place for the wedding .  
we don &apos;t have to .  
whoa - whoa - what ?  you found a place ?  
no .  but ,  monica and i were talking ,  and - and i was so upset about the hall being knocked down ,  and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit .  
she said what ?  
she said ,   &quot; if i &apos;m not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day ,  well then we should just postpone it .  &quot;  
postpone it ?  emily ,  do you think monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding ?  do you my sister &apos;s teeny - tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here ,  huh ?   this isn &apos;t right .  
i realise that people are going to be disappointed .  but ,  i &apos;m sure they &apos;ll come back when we can do it right .  
i can &apos;t ask people to do that ?  would you ask people to do that ?   
don &apos;t you point your pants at me !   we have no choice !  anywhere that &apos;s half - decent would &apos;ve be booked months ago ,  ross don &apos;t you understand ?  this is our wedding i &apos;m talking about .  
the only thing i understand is; postponing it is not an option .  this is when we &apos;re getting married .  
so what are you saying ?  it &apos;s now or never ?  
no .  i &apos;m saying it &apos;s now .   
or ?  
there &apos;s no  &apos;or &apos; in mind .  what is wrong with these pants ?  !  !  
it &apos;s not the pants .  it &apos;s you that is backwards .  and if ,  and if you don &apos;t understand how important this is to me ,  well then ,  perhaps we shouldn &apos;t get married at all !   
hey !  
 hi .  
so ,  did shopping make you feel any better about ross ?  
manhattan does not have enough stores .  
well ,  i think i can help you get over him .  
you can ?  
yeah .  i just need you to bring me some photos of ross .  
um - hmm .  
and a small piece of chocolate .  
okay .  
and a glass of tepid water .   
ooh ,  is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north - facing tree ?  
uh ,  only if you have the hiccups too .  yeah ,  the pictures are for you ,  the water and the chocolate is for me .  i just didn &apos;t feel like getting up .  okay ,  i &apos;m gonna show you a picture of ross .  okay ?  and you &apos;re going to remember all of the bad things about him .  all right ?  really focus on his flaws .  
i can do that .  i certainly did it when we were going out .  
okay .  umm ,  before we get started ,  i just wanna say for the record that i love ross ,  i think he &apos;s such a great guy .  here .   okay ,  now ,  close your eyes .  and imagine that you &apos;re with ross okay and imagine that you &apos;re kissing him .  and you &apos;re - you &apos;re running your hands all over his body .  and then you run your hands through his hair ,  but eew - oh gross it &apos;s some kind of grease ,  it &apos;s - uck !  hah ?  
i don &apos;t know ,  his uh ,  his hair never really bothered me that much ,  and y &apos;know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy .  
okay ,  this is going to be harder than i thought .  umm ,  let &apos;s try some uh ,  aversion therapy .  
okay .  
okay ?  
all right .  
so uh ,  now look at the picture .  .  .  
okay .  
all right ,  and umm .  .  .   
ow !  
okay ,  how do you feel now ?  
well ,  this is just as boring in england .   
hey .  
hey .   
oh .   sorry !  
no - no - no ,  y &apos;know what ?  i really shouldn &apos;t have said that you were embarrassing me ,  i mean that really wasn &apos;t cool .  and if it makes you feel any better ,  i &apos;ve had a really lousy day .  
me too .  
yeah ?  
noo !  !  i &apos;ve had the best day ever !  dude ,  check this out !  now ,  i &apos;m gonna fastforward past the part with you ,   &apos;cause it is boring .  
 hey !  
sh - shh - shh !    
 okay ,  so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat .  
 okay ,  so umm ,  what &apos;s your friend &apos;s name ?  
 oh ,  chandler .  
hi chandler !   
that &apos;s .  .  .  that &apos;s was .  .  .  
oh my god !  
that &apos;s fergie baby !  !  
joey says you don &apos;t really like his hat ,  but i think it &apos;s kinda dashing .  
 so ,  i hear you &apos;re single now .  .  .  
yeah ,  ummm ,  i don &apos;t like the hat that much .   
how did you ?  how ?  how ?  
well ,  i was trying to figure out how to get to buckingham palace ,  right ?  so ,  i &apos;m in my map and - and .  .  .  hey !  
hey !  
hi .  i understand you had a little talk with emily .  
 yes ,  i did !  and you are welcome !  
am i ?  !  and was it your idea to postpone the wedding ?  !  
umm .  .  .  
i &apos;m gonna go to the bathroom .  
wait up !   
hey - hey ,  since you &apos;re the  &apos;fix - it &apos; lady ,  here &apos;s a pickle ,  what do you do when the bride says she doesn &apos;t want to have the wedding at all ?  
she said that ?  !  
yeah .  
why ?  !  
i don &apos;t know ,  i told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out .  
oh my god .  you &apos;re even dumber than i am !  
excuse me ?  
ross ,  how long have you been planning this wedding ?  
i don &apos;t know .  a month ?  
emily has probably been planning it since she was five !  ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head .  that &apos;s what we did !  we dreamed about the perfect wedding ,  and the perfect place ,  with the perfect four - tiered wedding cake  ,  with the little people on top .   thanks .  but the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was .  
i had no idea .  and that - that pillowcase thing ,  i thought you guys were just doing the flying nun .  
sometimes we were .  
come on .  you gotta help me figure out what to do .  okay ?  
okay .  
come on .   
that was pretty intense huh ?  
yeah .   hey ,  i hope ross didn &apos;t think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here !  
ooh !  i thought of a good flaw !  ross pops his gum !  
oh ,  right !   wait a minute ,  i do that too .  
yeah ,  i know .  it drives me crazy .   
i &apos;ll get it .   
hello .  
 hey ,  pheebs !  it &apos;s joey !  
hey ,  joey !  hey !  ooh !  ooh !  i just say someone on the - that looks just like you on the subway .  and i was gonna go over and say  &apos;hi !  &apos; but then i figured ,  he doesn &apos;t care if he looks like you .  
that just cost me four bucks .  but uh listen ,  i just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing ?  
ohh ,  they &apos;re having a great time with their aunt phoebe !  aunt rachel hasn &apos;t been helpful at all .  so ,  do you miss me ?  
kinda ,  but i &apos;ve just been having way too much fun .  
so you &apos;re not homesick yet ?  
no ,  i don &apos;t think so .  
all right ,  the seven of us miss you .  
who &apos;s seven ?  
y &apos;know ,  me ,  rachel ,  the birds ,  the babies .  .  .  
ahh ,  the babies miss me ?  
of course they do !  or i &apos;m just really hungry .   
ooh ,  the pizza guy &apos;s here !  
what ?  you ordered pizza without me ?  !  
yeah .  but y &apos;know we were thinking about you ,  y &apos;know we ordered the joey special .  
two pizzas ?  !  
yep !  okay ,  gotta go ,  talk to you later .  
monica ,  why have you brought me here of all places ?  !  
you &apos;ll see .  
i tell you ,  this wedding is not going to happen .   
oh god .  
okay ?  but - but imagine a lot more lights ,  okay ?  and - and y &apos;know fewer bricks ,  and - and - and flowers ,  and candles .  .  .  
and the musicians ,  look ,  they can go over here  ,  okay ?  and the chairs can face this way  ,  and .  .  .   you go .  
but - but ,  if you don &apos;t love this ,  we &apos;ll do it in any other place at any other time .  really ,  it &apos;s fine ,  whatever you want .  
it &apos;s perfect .  
and ,  i don &apos;t know ,  if it starts to rain .  .  .  
well then we &apos;ll get wet .   
pheebs ?  
yeah ?  
do you remember where the duck food is ?  
yeah ,  it &apos;s in the guys &apos; apartment under the sink .  why ?  
 because i &apos;m going to london .  
what ?  !  what do you mean you &apos;re going to london ?  
yeah ,  i have to tell ross that i love him .  now honey ,  you take care ,  you don &apos;t have those babies until i get back .   
but what about all the  &quot; finding - his - flaws &quot;  stuff we &apos;ve been doing ?  
yeah ,  that didn &apos;t work .  
i - rachel ,  you can &apos;t go !  ross loves emily !  
yeah ,  i know ,  i know ,  i know he does .  but i have to tell him how i feel !  he deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision .  
that &apos;s not why you &apos;re going !  you &apos;re going because you hope he &apos;s gonna say ,   &quot; yeah ,  i love you too ,  rach .  forget that british chippy .  &quot;  
ohh - do you think he will ?  !  
no !  because he &apos;s in love with the british chippy !  look ,  rachel ,  if you go ,  you &apos;re just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding !  y &apos;know ,  it &apos;s too late !  you missed you &apos;re chance !  i &apos;m sorry ,  i know this must be really hard ,  it &apos;s over .  
y &apos;know what ?  no .  it &apos;s not over until someone says ,   &quot; i do .  &quot;   
the waltham residence .  
oh .  .  . yes .  . is this .  . umm .  . emily &apos;s parents &apos; house .  
this is the housekeeper speaking .  and by the way ,  young lady ,  that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone .  first one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak .  
what are you saying ?  !

ugh ,  pbs !  
what &apos;s wrong with pbs ?  
ugh ,  what &apos;s right with them ?  
why dont you like pbs ,  pheebs ?  
okay ,   &apos;cause right after my mom killed herself ,  i was just in this really bad place ,  y &apos;know personally .  so ,  i just thought that it &apos;d make me feel better if i wrote to sesame street ,   &apos;cause they were so nice when i was a little kid !  no one ever wrote back .  
well y &apos;know a lot of those muppets don &apos;t have thumbs .  
all i got was a lousy key chain !  and by that time i was living in a box .  i didn &apos;t have keys !  
i &apos;m sorry pheebs ,  i just ,  y &apos;know ,  i just wanted to do a good deed .  like - like you did with the babies .  
this isn &apos;t a good deed ,  you just wanted to get on tv !  this is totally selfish .  
whoa !  whoa !  whoa !  what about you ,  having those babies for your brother ?  talk about selfish !  
what - what are you talking about ?  !  
well ,  yeah ,  it was a really nice thing and all ,  but it made you feel really good right ?  
yeah .  so ?  
it made you feel good ,  so that makes it selfish .  look ,  there &apos;s no unselfish good deeds ,  sorry .  
yes there are !  there are totally good deeds that are selfless .  
well ,  may i ask for one example ?  
yeah ,  it &apos;s y &apos;know there &apos;sno you may not !   
that &apos;s because all people are selfish .  
are you calling me selfish ?  !  
are you calling you people ?   yeah ,  well sorry to burst that bubble ,  pheebs ,  but selfless good deeds don &apos;t exist .  okay ?  and you the deal on santa clause right ?  
i &apos;m gonna find a selfless good dead .  i &apos;m gonna beat you ,  you evil genius .   
 hello .  
 hello ,  ross ?  
emily ?  emily !  oh my god !  oh my god ,  it &apos;s emily !   it &apos;s emily everyone !  shush - shush - shhst !   hi !  
ross ,  i &apos;m only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives .  good - bye !  
no wait !  look ,  wait !  okay ,  you can hang up ,  but i &apos;m gonna keep calling !  i &apos;m gonna ,  i &apos;m gonna call everyone in england if that &apos;s what it takes to get you to talk to me !  
really ?  about what ?  
look you &apos;re my wife .  we &apos;re - we &apos;re married .  y &apos;know ?  i - i love you .  i - i really miss you .  
i miss you to .  well ,  at least i think i do .  
 she &apos;s talking .  
 yay !   
hey ,  joey ,  when you said the deal with santa clause ,  you meant ?  
that he doesn &apos;t exist .  
so chandler ,  have you heard about monica &apos;s secret boyfriend ?  
uhh ,  yeah .  she uh ,  she uh ,  she uh might &apos;ve mentioned him .  
so mon ,  when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man ?  
ohh ,  he &apos;s really shy .  i - i dont think he &apos;s up to meeting everyone yet .  
yeah ,  i don &apos;t think he &apos;s up to meeting everyone yet .  
i dont care !  i wanna meet this guy who &apos;s the best sex she ever had !   
really ?  !  that &apos;s what you heard ?   you said that ?  
i might &apos;ve said that .   why is that funny ?  
because i &apos;m very happy for him !   and you ,  you lucky dog !  
 hi !  
hey !  
well ,  emily &apos;s willing to work on the relationship .  
yes !  
that &apos;s great !  
in london !  
what ?  !  
she wants me to move to london .  
but you live here !   you know that .  
what - what - what are you gonna do ?  
i bet if i talk to carol and susan i can convince them to move to london with ben .  
yeah ,  i &apos;m sure your ex - wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife .  
 how ya doin &apos; ?  welcome .  good to see ya !  
that &apos;s great .  but uh ,  i &apos;m not really expecting a lot of calls .  
but i &apos;m the host !  
i cannot believe i can &apos;t find a selfless good deed !  y &apos;know that old guy that lives next to me ?  well ,  i snuck over there and - and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop .  but he caught me and force - fed me cider and cookies .  then i felt wonderful .  that old jackass !  
maybe joey &apos;s right .  maybe all good deeds are selfish .  
i will find a selfless good deed !   &apos;cause i just gave birth to three children and i will not let them be raised in a world where joey is right !  
 hey ,  monica ?  can i ask you a cooking question ?  
sure !  
if you &apos;re cooking on the stove ,  does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than richard ?  
chandler !   is he ?  
well ,  y &apos;know i - i - i think i &apos;m gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend .  
all right emily ,  as much as i love you ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  i can &apos;t move to london without ben .  
i understand that would be difficult .  
yeah ,  would you please consider moving here ?  i mean you were gonna move here anyway ,  why can &apos;t you just do that ?  
i don &apos;t know ,  it &apos;s just 
oh - oh - okay ,  but - but i know ,  that even though i &apos;ve been a - a complete idiot up  &apos;til now ,  i mean ,  i mean you - you - you have to come here .  you have to come here so we can work this out .  
all right .  
all right ,  did you just say all right ?  
i did .  now i &apos;m the idiot .  
oh ,  emily that is ,  that is so great .  it &apos;s gonna be so great !  we &apos;re gonna be like - like - like two idiots in love !   
ross ,  there &apos;s one thing that really scares me still .  
yes ,  tell me .  
well ,  you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family ,  all my friends .  
i know .  i am ,  i am so sorry .  
and then after decided to forgive you ,  seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her .  
again ,  very sorry .  
i mean ,  i can &apos;t - i can &apos;t be in the same room as her !  it drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her !  
emily ,  there is nothing between rachel and me .  okay ?  i love you .  
all right .  i &apos;ll come to new york and we &apos;ll try and make this work .  
oh that is so great !  that &apos;s 
so i asked emily if she would come to new york ,  and she said yes .  
yes !  
ooh - ohh !  
great !  
no - no - no !  only if i promise never to see rachel again .  
why ?  
what ?  !  you can &apos;twhat did you tell her ?  
i told her i &apos;d have to think about it .  i mean ,  how the hell am i supposed to make this kind of a decision ?   i &apos;m actually asking you !  
well ,  you can &apos;t just not see rachel anymore ,  she &apos;s one of your best friends .  
yeah !  but ,  he can &apos;t not exactly see emily ,  i mean that &apos;s his wife .  
yeah .  
that &apos;s true !  
yeah ,  but you &apos;ve known rachel since high school and you cannot just cut her out of your life .  
that &apos;s true !  
no ,  you cannot .

 hey joey ,  i just wanted to let you know that i found a selfless good deed .  i just went down to the park and i let a bee sting me .  
what ?  !  what good is that gonna do anybody ?  
well ,  it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends .  the bee is happy and i am definitely not .  
now ,  y &apos;know the bee probably died after he stung ya .  
 aw ,  dammit !    
hey ,  excuse me ,  would you mind switching with me ?  
 okay ,  that &apos;s it .  i cannot make this decision !  it is too difficult ,  so i &apos;m just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate .   
a magic eight ball ?  !  you can &apos;t be serious ,  you can &apos;t make this decision with a toy !  
ooh ,  it &apos;s not a toy .  
well ,  i don &apos;t know what else to do .  i mean ,  i either keep my wife and lose one of my - my - my best friends or i keep my friend and get divorced the second time before i &apos;m 30 !  so - so if anyone has - has a better suggestion ,  let &apos;s hear it !   &apos;cause i - i got nothing !  all right ,  don &apos;t be shy ,  any suggestion will do .   okay then .  here we go .  magic 8 ball ,  should i never see rachel again ?   ask again later .  later is not good enough .   ask again later .  what the hell !  this is broken !  it - it is broken !  
 pbs telethon .  
 hi joey .  
hey pheebs !  
i would like to make a pledge .  i would like to donate $200 .  
$200 ?  are you sure pheebs ?  i mean ,  after what sesame street did to ya ?  
oh ,  i &apos;m still mad at them but i also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who &apos;s moms didn &apos;t kill themselves ,  so by supporting them ,  i &apos;m doing a good thing ,  but i &apos;m not happy about it .  so there ,  a selfless good deed .  
and you don &apos;t a little good about donating the money ?  
no ,  it sucks .  i was saving up to buy a hamster .  
a hamster ?  what ,  those things are like 10 bucks .  
yeah ,  not the one i had my eye on .  thank you viewers !  the pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers  oh boy !  and may i say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers ,   mr .  joseph tribbiani !  
 look ,  maybe i got carried away before .  but there &apos;s something you gotta know .  if i &apos;m the best ,  it &apos;s only because you &apos;ve made me the best .  
keep talking .  
i mean i was nothing before you .  call the other girls and ask .  which wouldn &apos;t take long .  but when i &apos;m with you ,  and we &apos;re together ,  oh my god .  
really ?  
oh - aw my god !  now ,  i understand if you never want to sleep with me again ,  but that would be wrong .  we &apos;re too good !  we owe it ,  to sex !  
well ,  if we owe it ?   oh my when is joey gonna be home ?  
well ,  i was kinda hoping we could do this without him .   oh no - no - no ,  leave the gloves on .

i &apos;m really getting tired of sneaking around .  
i know ,  me too .  hey !  y &apos;know what if we went away for a whole weekend ?  y &apos;know we &apos;d have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time .

i &apos;m not in charge of where the conference is held .  do you want people to think it &apos;s a fake conference ?  it &apos;s a real conference .

wow ,  so you guys are ,  you &apos;re never gonna be in the same room together ?  how is that even gonna work ?

uh ,  hey !  
what &apos;s going on ?  
we &apos;re flipping monica &apos;s mattress .

condoms ?  
you don &apos;t know how long we &apos;re gonna be in here !  we may have to repopulate the earth .

 hey !  
hey ,  mr .  bing .  that uh ,  hotel you stayed at called .  said someone left an eyelash curler in your room .  
yes that was mine .

yeah ,  just some 9 - year - old filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour .   that didn &apos;t happen ,  i made that up !  
 hey !  
oh ,  ross ?  ross !  you can &apos;t put up flyers in here .  
how come ?  everybody else does .  
you can &apos;t .  
what is that ?  
oh ,  umm ,  i &apos;m just getting rid of a couple of things .  
 this is all of your things .  
yes ,  yes it is !  no ,  but it &apos;s good it &apos;semily thinks we should get all new stuff .  stuff that &apos;s just ours ,  together .  y &apos;know brand new .  
so basically ,  this is a getting - rid - of - everything - rachel - ever - used sale .  
touched .  used .  sat on .  sleep on .  
i &apos;ll take it all .  
hey ,  ross ,  you &apos;re okay with that ?  
look ,  if i can just do what emily wants and get her to new york ,  i &apos;m sure everything will be fine .  
okay ,  but don &apos;t you think this is a little extreme ?  
after what i did ?  can you blame her ?  
oh my god !  you got off easy !  when my friend silvie &apos;s husband said someone else &apos;s name in bed ,  she cursed him and turned his thingy green .   
 what is he doing ?  what ,  emily ,  thinks ross &apos;s furniture has got rachel coodies ?  
now calm down joey .  
no !  everything &apos;s gettin &apos; all messed up ,  y &apos;know ?  emily won &apos;t let ross see rachel ,  we &apos;re not gonna stop seeing rachel ,  hence ross stops seeing us !  
oh ,  i hate this .  everything &apos;s changing .  
yeah i know ,  we &apos;re losing ross ,  joey said hence 
look ,  i &apos;m not happy about this either ,  but y &apos;know if - if ross says he &apos;s happy then we &apos;re just gonna have to keep our feelings about emily to ourselves .  are you cool with that ?  
ohh ,  whoa god !  storage rooms give me the creeps !  monica ,  come on please hurry up honey !  please ?  
rachel ,  if you want the little round waffles ,  you gotta have to wait until i find the little waffle iron .  
i want the little round waffles .

okay ,  y &apos;know what ?  i &apos;ll - i &apos;ll have toast !   
arghhhh !  !  !  !  !  !

why ?  
well ,  her thought is ,  and i agree ,  fresh new furniture ,  why not a fresh new apartment ?  her cousin has this great place to sublet ,  it &apos;s got a view of the river on one side and columbia on the other .  
that &apos;s way uptown !  that &apos;s like three trains away !   which is great !  i love to ride that rail !  
so you &apos;re really okay with this ?  
yes !  yes !  i mean it &apos;s - it &apos;s kinda far from work ,  but uh ,  y &apos;know ,  i &apos;ll get so much done on the commute .  i - i &apos;ve been given the gift of time !  
now that &apos;s so funny ,  because last christmas i got the gift of space .  we should get them together and make a continuum .   
now he &apos;s movin &apos; ?  man ,  what is emily doing to him ?   ow !  !  he &apos;s not even here !  !  !   
you guys !  you guys !  
we were ,  we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man !  
it was like this crazy - eyed ,  hairy beast man !  he was like a ,  like a bigfoot or a yeti or something !  
and he came at us with an axe ,  so rachel had to use a bug bomb on him !  
 yeah ,  i - i - i just pulled the tab and i just fogged his yeti ass !  
uhh ,  like dark hair ,  bushy beard ?  
yeah !  
yeah ,  you fogged danny .  
please !  we did not fog danny !  who &apos;s danny ?  
dan just moved in downstairs .  yeah ,  he just got back from like this four - month trek in the andes .  nice fella .  
yeah ?  
hi !  you might not remember us ,  but we are the girls that fogged you .  
we &apos;re - we &apos;re really sorry we fogged you .  
okay .   
hi !  just so you know ,  we - we didn &apos;t mean to fog you ,  we thought you were like a yeti or something .  
okay .   and he answers it . ) 
yesss ?  
hi !  sorry to bother you ,  but i don &apos;t think we can accept your acceptance of our apology ,  it just doesn &apos;t really seem like you mean it .  
yeah .  
o - kay !   
wow !  that guy is so rude !  
really !  what is with that guy ?  i mean you &apos;d forgive me if i fogged you .  
well you did a little bit .  
oh my god ,  honey ,  i &apos;m so sorry !  
i totally forgive you !  
really ?  
hey !  
hey !  
so listen ,  you know my friend chris who owns the crematorium ?  
crematorium chris ?  sure !  
he says ,  that he would cremate my fur coat for free if i umm ,  y &apos;know ,  bring in the next person i know who dies .   
oh my god !  oh my god ,  look at these pelts !  
don &apos;t get too attached ,  she &apos;s having it cremated .  
what ?  uhh ,  phoebe ,  honey ,  honey ,  i know you &apos;re quirky and i get a big kick out of it ,  we all do actually ,  but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature !  not nature ,  fashion !  
 i know i miss you too .  i can &apos;t wait to see you .  i love you .  bye .   
okay ,  what is in here ?  rocks ?  
no - no ,  this is my collection of fossil samples .  
so ,  rocks .   
i &apos;m really gonna miss this apartment .  y &apos;know ,  ben - ben took his first steps right over there .   
ohh .  hey ,  remember when i ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little ?  
i loved this place !  to tell you the truth ,  i wish i didn &apos;t have to move .  
uhh ,  are you saying that you &apos;re not entirely happy about this ?  
well ,  i mean if uh ,  if emily gave me a choice 
you do have a choice !  !  ross ,  why are you listening to her ?  !  are you ,  are you crazy ?  !  
why ?  
it &apos;s not right what emily wants you to do !  she is totally -  - owww !  !  stop pinching me !  look ,  now you guys said i only had to keep my mouth shut as long as ross was happy ,  right ?  well he just told me that he &apos;s not entirely happy .  
what &apos;s going on ?  
we all hate emily !  
nooo !  !  
no ,  ross ,  we do not hate emily .  we - we just ,  we just think that you &apos;re having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy .  
yeah !  
look ,  we just think that maybe she &apos;s being a little unreasonable .  
yes !  yes !  unreasonable !  
unreasonable ?  how about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married !  you have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work !  all right ,  it &apos;s about compromise !  do you always like it ?  no !  do you do it ?  yes !  because it &apos;s not all laughing ,  happy ,  candy in the sky ,  drinking coffee at central perk all the time !  it &apos;s real life ,  okay ?  it &apos;s what grown - ups do !   
god ,  i feel so guilty about ross .  
oh ,  i know .  
i kinda feel like it &apos;s my fault .   
kind of ?  if you just kept this to yourself none of this would &apos;ve happened .  
well ,  i &apos;m keeping so many things to myself these days ,  something was bound to slip out !   
well ,  i think it &apos;s very brave what you said .   
all right ,  i can &apos;t sit here anymore .  i have to walk places .   
pheebs ,  what are you doing with the coat ?  how about the whole animal rights thing ?  
hi !

i had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh ,  fogger smell .  
oh .  listen ,  i &apos;m so sorry .  i would ,  i would &apos;ve never fogged you if y &apos;know if you hadn &apos;t looked so  .  y &apos;know .

how ?  
well guys tend to get naked before they &apos;re gonna have sex .  
what ?  !  i mean ,  i didn &apos;t work this hard and - and - and lose all this weight so that i can give my flower to someone like him !  
okay ,  first of all ,  if you keep calling it that ,  no one &apos;s gonna ever take it .  then ,  second of all you &apos;re not actually gonna have sex with him !  you &apos;re just gonna make him think that you are .  
yeah .  
yeah .  
and when he &apos;s naked i can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him !  
then ,  you will definitely get him back !  
okay ,  so how do i make him think i wanna have sex with him ?  
okay ,  oh ,  here &apos;s what you do .  just act like everything around you turns you on .  
what do you mean ?  
well ,  like anything can be sexy .  like umm ,  oh - oh ,  like this dishtowel !   ooh ,  ooh ,  this feels sooo good against my cheek !  and - and if i feel a little hot ,  i can just dab myself with it .  or i can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while i talk to him .  
 i can do that !

okay ,  look ,  i - i have enough stuff for one more sandwich ,  i mean i was going to eat it myself ,  but  
 that - that would be incredible .  thank you so much .  i - i still can &apos;t believe someone ate it !  !  i mean ,  look ,  i left a note and everything .   
 knock - knock .  who &apos;s there ?  ross geller &apos;s lunch .  ross geller &apos;s lunch ,  who ?  ross geller &apos;s lunch ,  please don &apos;t take me .  okay ?

 sorry i &apos;m late ,  but i left late .  
okay .  
so pheebs ,  what is the book about ?  
i thought you said you read it in high school .  
well yeah ,  but then i remembered i started it and there was this pep rally and i was ,  i was on top of the pyramid but anywayumm ,  what is this book about ?  
okay ,  umm ,  it &apos;s this tragic love story between cathy and heathcliff and umm ,  it takes place on like these really creepy mores in england .  which i think represents the wildness of heathcliff &apos;s character .  i totally get symbolism .  here  ,  rachel green ?  
umm ,  well i would have to say that it &apos;s a ,  it &apos;s tragic love story .  
oh - oh - oh ,  symbolism !  and uh ,  the - the uh ,  wildness of the mores ,  which i think is - is mirrored in the wildness of heathcliff &apos;s character .  
 you completely stole my answer !  
well ,  honey that was pretty obvious .  
well how would you know ?  !  you didn &apos;t even read it !  
i think that uh ,  yours is a question with many answers .  
would you care to venture one ?  
are you just repeating what i &apos;m saying ?  
yeah but why didn &apos;t you just say that you didn &apos;t read the book ?  !  
be - because i didn &apos;t want him to think i was stupid !  i mean ,  that was really embarrassing what happened to you !  
 phoebe !  
yeah ?  
phoebe !  you &apos;re note ,  amazing !  not only did no one touch my sandwich ,  but people at work are actually afraid of me .  yeah ,  a guy called me mental !  mental geller ,  yeah ,  i always wanted a cool nickname like that .

no - no ,  wait !  there &apos;s got to be a better explanation .  you can tell them you had to make an adult film for your  adult film class .  
yeah ,  i like that .  but no - no ,  how does that explain why rachel found my underwear at your place ?  
ohi don &apos;t know .

what ?  !  people now call you mental .  
 yeah .  
oh no ,  you - you don &apos;t understand .  ugh ,  this is so silly .  umm ,  this is all because of a sandwich .  
yeah .  you see my - my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches .  her secret is ,  she puts a ,  an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; i call it the moist maker .  anyway ,  i - i put my sandwich in the fridge over here 
what ?  
you ate my sandwich ?  
 oh - oh really ?  did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a moist maker ?  
do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it ?  
 that said it was my sandwich ?  !  be in the trash .  
 what ?  away .  
you - you - you - you  threw my sandwich away !   
 my sandwich ?  !  !  !   
hi !  
hi !  
 so umm ,  what &apos;s this book about ?  
you didn &apos;t read this one either ?  !  
well ,  i was gonna ,  but i accidentally read something else .  
what ?  
vogue !  hey ,  so tell me about this jane eyre woman .  
no !  you should &apos;ve read it yourself !  
come on phoebe !  dont be such a goodie - goodie !  
fine !  okay ,  all right ,  so jane eyre ,  first of all ,  you &apos;d think she &apos;s a woman ,  but she &apos;s not .  she &apos;s a cyborg .  
a cyborg ?  !  isn &apos;t that like a robot ?  !  
yeah ,  this book was light years ahead of its time .  everybody think about jane eyre ?  
umm ,  rachel and i were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights .  
uh ,  thank you phoebe .  umm ,  well ,  what struck me most when reading jane eyre was uh ,  how the book was so ahead of its time .  
hey .  
hey .  okay ,  so umm ,  since that video camera thing didn &apos;t work out uh ,  i thought that i would give you just a little preview .   
 you &apos;re naked in this picture !  
i know .   
ross ?  
 hey chandler .   monica !  
ross ,  are you okay ?  
i &apos;m fine !  i saw a psychiatrist at work today .  
why ?  !  
on account of my rage .  
which i may say ,  right now ,  is out of control .  
he gave me a pill for it .  
a pill ?  
uh - huh .  well ,  when the psychiatrist told me i had to take a leave of absence because i yelled at my boss i started to get worked up again ,  so he offered me a tranquilizer .  and i thought was a good idea so ,  i took it .  
wait a minute ,  they &apos;re making you take time off work ?  
and you &apos;re okay with that ?  
 ugh ,  that was so embarrassing !  i can &apos;t believe you let me go on and on like that !  
 i &apos;m sorry .  it was just so funny when you started comparing jane eyre to robocop .  
that was not funny !  
well ,  i snapped !  okay ?  you weren &apos;t taking the class seriously .  
phoebe ,  come on !  what is the big deal ?  i thought this was going to be something we could do together !  y &apos;know ,  i thought it would be fun !  
well ,  yeah !  fun is good ,  but y &apos;know i also wanted to learn .  y &apos;know ,  people are always talking about what they learned in high school and i never went to high school .  
 oh my god !  that &apos;s monica !  !  
oh no - no - no !  no - no - no - no - no - no - no !  
you get away from me !  !  you sick ,  sick ,  sick ,  sick - o !  !

look !   
 dude !  that &apos;s my sister !   
 give me that !  
all right ,  wait !  just wait .  everybody just calm down .  okay ?  let &apos;s give our friend joey a chance to explain why he &apos;s such a big pervert !  
no !  i am not a pervert !  okay ?  it &apos;s just i just kinda 
all right ,  look !  look .  i think i can explain this .   
thank you !  
joey &apos;s a sex addict .  
what ?  !  !   no i &apos;m not !  !  
it &apos;s okay !  it &apos;s good !  it &apos;s good .  it &apos;s a disease !  
no !  no !  i am not a sex addict !  
yes you are !  that &apos;s the only way to explain all this stuff !  
no it isn &apos;t !  no ,  it &apos;s not .  because you can also explain it with the truth !  
well ,  what is the truth ?  
yeah ,  what &apos;s going on ?  
what &apos;s going on ?  
 i slept with monica .  
well let &apos;s  . let &apos;s see what everybody thinks of that ?  
oh no !  
you slept with my sister ?  
uh yes ,  but it was ,  we just did it once uh ,  in london .

monica ,  is this true ?  
of course it &apos;s true !  how else would you explain all the weird stuff that &apos;s been going on ?  
yes it &apos;s true .  
okay ,  but if it only happened that one time ,  how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day ?  
ahhoy !  that was the underwear i was wearing that night in london .  right monica ?  
i guess i wanted to keep it  as a souvenir .  
my god monica !  !

no !  if anyone &apos;s a sex addict here ,  it &apos;s monica !  yeah .  yeah .  she has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since london !  
so that &apos;s why she gave you a naked picture of herself .  
that makes sense !  
and the video camera ?

i guess i set up the video camera to try and entice joey .  
but sadly i could not be enticed .  
unbelievable !  i mean you really kept joey &apos;s underwear ?  !  why ?  why would you do that ?  !  
i &apos;m monica .  i &apos;m disgusting .  i stalk guys and keep their underpants .

well ,  i met danny &apos;s sister yesterday ,  and uh that was actually the girl on the subway .  
oh ,  you &apos;re kidding .

joey &apos;s not going .  
 i didn &apos;t finish my five pages .  
well ,  why can &apos;t you do them tomorrow ?  
because tomorrow he &apos;s redoing yesterday &apos;s pages .  
yesterday &apos;s pages did not reflect my best work .  
 why don &apos;t you cut him a little slack ?  okay ?  maybe if he relaxes a little bit ,  he &apos;ll get some work done .  
i think he &apos;s been relaxing enough ,  thanks to you and fireball .  
dude ,  if you think fireball &apos;s relaxing ,  you &apos;ve obviously have never played .  
the only reason you &apos;re doing this to joey is because you &apos;re bored .  okay ,  it &apos;s not his fault that you &apos;re unemployed .  
i am not unemployed .  i &apos;m on sabbatical !  
come on look guys ,  don &apos;t fight .  
and the reason i &apos;m doing this is because i am joey &apos;s friend .  and if you were a good friend ,  you &apos;d be doing the same thing .  
oh ,  so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk ?  
if it does ?  then you &apos;re an amazing friend of mine .  
hey - hey guys ,  hey !  how about we settle this over a friendly game of fireball ?  huh ?  i &apos;ll go unhook the smoke detectors !  
how about we settle this right now !   there !  now ,  no one &apos;s going to the game .  ha - ha - ha !

ooh !  that &apos;s a good one !  mine is to pilot a commercial jet .  
that &apos;s good one too ,  pheebs .  now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who &apos;s resolution is to plummet to their deaths .  
maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends ,  especially the ones who may soon be flying you to europe for free on their own plane .  
she has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us .  
in fact ,  i &apos;ll bet you 50 bucks that you can &apos;t go the whole year without making fun of us .  eh ,  y &apos;know what ,  better yet ?  a week .  
i &apos;ll take that bet my friend .  and you know what ,  paying me the 50 bucks could be the  &quot; new thing you do that day !  &quot;   and it starts right now !  
all right ,  my new year &apos;s resolution is to learn how to play the guitar .  
ohh .  
really ?  !  how come ?

hey rach ,  maybe your resolution should be to umm ,  gossip less .  
i don &apos;t gossip !   
well ,  maybe sometimes i find out things or i hear something and i pass that information on y &apos;know kinda like a public service ,  it doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m a gossip .  i mean ,  would you call ted kopel a gossip ?  
well if ted kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs ,  i would .

okay ,  so now they know that you know and they don &apos;t know that rachel knows ?  
yes ,  but y &apos;know what ?  it doesn &apos;t matter who knows what .  now ,  enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know !  then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over !  
or ,  we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own .  
wh - what do you mean ?  
well y &apos;know every time that they say that like they &apos;re doing laundry we &apos;ll just give them a bunch of laundry to do .

well ,  my grandfather was swedish and my grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny .  
okay ,  now you &apos;re even cuter !  !  
y &apos;know that is a popular opinion today i must say .  
what ?  
the weirdest thing happened at the coffee house ,  i think ,  i think phoebe was hitting on me .  
what are you talking about ?  
i &apos;m telling you i think phoebe thinks i &apos;m foxy .  
that &apos;s not possible !  
ow !  
i &apos;m sorry it &apos;s just ,  phoebe just always thought you were ,  you were charming in a ,  in a sexless kind of way .  
oh ,  y &apos;know i - i can &apos;t hear that enough .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  i think that you just misunderstood her .  
no ,  i didn &apos;t misunderstand ,  okay ?  she was all over me !  she touched my bicep for crying out loud !  
this bicep ?

i mean i - i don &apos;t i think i have enough quarters .  
i have quarters !   
 hey !  
hey ross !  any word on the apartment yet ?  
well ,  i called over there and it turns out ugly naked guy is subletting it himself and he &apos;s already had like a hundred applicants .  
oh .  
no - no ,  i got the edge .  i know it &apos;s not exactly ethical but i sent him a little bribe to tip the scales in my direction .  check it out ,  you can probably see it from the window .   
oh ,  is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it ?  
no .  
that new mountain bike ?  
no .  
well what did you send ?  
a basket of mini - muffins .  
but there &apos;s a whole table of mini - muffin baskets .  which one did you send ?  
the small one .  
what ?  !  you - you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment ?  
well yeah !  someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins .  it was the best day .  
your work makes me sad .  
oh man !  i want that place so much !  !  i was so sure that was gonna work !  there &apos;s twelve bucks i &apos;ll never see again !   
all right honey ,  we &apos;d better go if we wanna catch that movie .  
bye !  
bye !  
bye chandler !   i miss you already .   
 okay ,  did you see that ?  !  with the inappropriate and the pinching !  !  
actually ,  i did !  
okay ,  so now do you believe that she &apos;s attracted to me ?  
ohhh ,  oh my god !  oh my god !  she knows about us !  
are you serious ?  
phoebe knows and she &apos;s just trying to freak us out !  that &apos;s the only explanation for it !  
 joey !   
yeah ?  
phoebe knows about us !  
well i didn &apos;t tell them !  
them ?  !  who &apos;s them ?  
uhhh ,  phoebe and joey .  
joey !  
and rachel .  i would &apos;ve told you but they made me promise not to tell !  
oh man !  
i &apos;m sorry !  but hey ,  it &apos;s over now ,  right ?  because you can tell them that you know they know and i can go back to knowing absolutely nothing !  
unless 
no !  not unless !  look this must end now !  
oh man ,  they think they are so slick messing with us !  but see they don &apos;t know that we know that they know !  so 
noooo .  
oh ross ,  honey you gotta stop torturing yourself !  
yeah ,  why don &apos;t you just find another apartment ?  
look i &apos;ve already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one !  
y &apos;know what you should do ?  
huh ?  
you should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him .  yeah !  like if i would strike up a conversation about say umm ,  sandwiches .  or uh ,  or my underwear .  
i &apos;m listening .  
 see ?  
that is a great idea !  and !  i know ugly naked guy because we &apos;ve been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge !  oh ,  let &apos;s see now he had the trampoline .  
he broke that .  
well ,  he had gravity boots .  
yeah ,  he broke those too .  
so he likes to break stuff .  
okay ,  i &apos;ve got to go pick up ben but i - i will figure something out .   hey ,  didn &apos;t he used to have a cat ?  
i wouldn &apos;t bring that up ,  it would probably just bum him out .  
yeah ,  poor cat ,  never saw that big butt coming .  
right .    
hello !   oh yeah !  hey !  hold on a second she &apos;s right here !   it &apos;s chandler .

 sounds like a fun party .  
hmm .  look ,  ross ,  if you want your neighbors to like you ,  why don &apos;t you just pay the hundred bucks ?  the party &apos;s gonna cost you way more than that .  
it doesn &apos;t matter !  it &apos;s my principles !  we &apos;re talking about my principles !  
okay ,  i thought it was about your neighbors liking you .  
oh ,  they &apos;ll like me .  once they come to my awesome par - tay !  okay ,  i gotta run .  i gotta go get some nametags .   
and that crazy party animal will be your brother - in - law .  
very ,  very funny ,  but don &apos;t say things like that in front of monica .  i don &apos;t want you putting any ideas in her head .  
umm ,  chandler ,  you do realize that those ideas are probably already in monica &apos;s head .  
wh - wh - why ?  !  
well ,  because she loves you and because you love her .  
yeah ,  so ,  what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?  !  
hey ,  chandler ,  don &apos;t freak out !  i &apos;m telling you something you already know !  come on ,  she broke up with richard because he didn &apos;t want to have babies .  and she &apos;s a woman ,  and she &apos;s almost 30 ,  and y &apos;know it &apos;s monica .  
i don &apos;t see it that way .  okay ?  because ,  i see two monicas ,  the one that was my friend ,  who lived across the hall ,  and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new monica ,  who i just started to date .  now ,  who &apos;s to say what she wants ?  !  im right .  i &apos;m right .  am i right ?  
no ,  you &apos;re right ,  you are absolutely right .  i mean that makes ,  that makes everything different .  
okay .  it &apos;s not different at all ,  is it ?  
you were so funny with that waiter !  you &apos;re such a nut !   
 y &apos;know ,  breadstick fangs are always funny .  
no ,  you make them funny .  you &apos;re the funny one !   
uhh ,  look katie ,  uh listen ,  we - we need to talk .  okay ?  umm ,  look i like you .  i - i really do ,  i like you a lot .  okay ?  but sometimes when you ,  when you playfully punch me like that it - it feels like someone &apos;s hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat .  
isn &apos;t this great ?  
hmm .  
couldn &apos;t you just stay like this forever ?   chandler !  couldn &apos;t you just stay here forever ?  
yeah ,  here ,  somewhere else ,  y &apos;know where - where ever .   
are you okay ?  
yeah ,  i &apos;m cool .  casual .  
what - what are you doing ?  
i &apos;m just hanging out .  y &apos;know ,  having fun .  y &apos;know with the girl that i &apos;m seeing casually .

well ,  you do want all that stuff ,  right ?  
oh and you know what i want !  
yes !  you want babies !  you have baby fever !  
i do not have baby fever !  
oh please ,  you are obsessed with babies and - and marriage and everything that &apos;s related to babies and - and marriage !  i &apos;ve got an idea ,  why don &apos;t we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker ?  !  
have you lost your mind ?  chandler ,  this isn &apos;t about me !  this is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap !  
nah - uh !  i know you !  okay ?  i know the thoughts that you have in the head -  - in your head !  
you don &apos;t know everything .  did you know that i &apos;m going out with rachel tonight instead of you ?  hmm ?  and did you know that the only baby around here is you ?  !  and did you know that i can &apos;t even look at you right now ?  !   
it &apos;s gonna be okay ,  right ?  i mean she &apos;s not gonna leave me ?  this is ,  this is fixable .  
by me ?

yeah ,  big !   
uh - oh ,  shht !  the misses .  
gunther ,  can i get a coffee  to go ?

just tell me what i need to do to make things right .  
what ?  !  
well ,  that &apos;s what we do .  y &apos;know ,  i - i mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then i do and then y &apos;know you think i &apos;m all cute again .

yeah ,  get out !  now !  
go back to 3 - b ,  3 - b !  
obviously i didn &apos;t think they were gonna start throwing things .  i just thought if i kept insulting everyone ,  you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero .

wait what - wh - wh - what are you doing ?  !  
 monica 
no - no ,  don &apos;t - don &apos;t - don &apos;t do it !  
will you marry me ?   
oh - no .  no .  no .  
what a bad idea !  
ohhhh ,  i cannot look at it !   
chandler ,  why are you doing this ?  
i don &apos;t know .  but i know i &apos;m not afraid to do this .  
chandler .  
i &apos;m doing this because i &apos;m sorry ?  
do you umm ,  you really think the best reason to get married is because you &apos;re sorry ?  
no ,  the best reason to get married is pregnancy .  sorry is pretty much fourth y &apos;know ,  behind being ready and actually wanting to get married .   will you be my wife ?  
 chandler ,  umm ,  i want you to take just a minute and i want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds .  
yeah ,  i &apos;m kinda wishing everyone wasn &apos;t here right now .  
honey !  do you know that none of that stuff came from me ?  !  i mean i never said i wanted to have babies and get married right now !  
yeah i know ,  but i was really confused and then i talked to these guys .   
who ?  two divorces and joey ?  !  
hey !  
she &apos;s right y &apos;know .  
yeah ,  but still ,  cheap shot !  
y &apos;know what ?  y &apos;know when i said that i want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own ?  well ,  you &apos;re not ready for that .  
i didn &apos;t think i was !   
oh my god ,  what would have done if i said yes ?  
hey ross ,  will you pass me that knife ?  
no ,  i will not !  
oh ,  it &apos;s okay .  you don &apos;t have to be so mean about it .  
you &apos;re right ,  i &apos;m sorry .  will you marry me ?   
aw ,  and i was gonna ask you to marry me because i forgot to say hello to you last week .  
oh no wait pheebs ,  i think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you .  but i &apos;m not sure ,  chandler ?  
okay ,  how long is this going to go on .  
well i think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so ,  a long time .  
this is fun .  hey rach ,  remember that whole  &quot; we were on a break thing ?  &quot;  well ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  will you marry me ?

phoebe ,  i bet somebody &apos;s missing that badge .  
yeah ,  i should probably take it back .  ooh ,  but you know what ?  while i &apos;m at the police station ,  i could check their ten most wanted lists because my friend fritzy has been like number 11 forever ,  so this could be her year !

in the dream i did enjoy the closeness .  
um - hmm .  
joey ,  look ,  are you attracted to monica ?  right here ,  right now ,  are you attracted to her ?

 yeah ,  well ,  y &apos;know umm no honey ,  listen i think it &apos;s a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them ,  but i think the way you do it is y &apos;know you meet someone ,  become their friend ,  build a foundation ,  then you ask them out on a date .  don &apos;t hit on your existing friends !  
won &apos;t - won &apos;t that take longer ?

 oh ,  we &apos;re not seeing a movie !  
you &apos;re not ?  then why did you ask us if we wanted to go ?  
oh umm ,  that &apos;s because i just wanted to y &apos;know walk in on me and chandler while we were ,  y &apos;know ,  doing it all night .  will you excuse me for just a second ?  
yeah !  
okay .   chandler ?  can i see you for a second ?  
uh ,  yeah .  
okay .   we have got to beat them !  {here we go yet again . } 
why ?  
 &apos;cause ,  gary and phoebe think they &apos;re a hotter couple than we are !  
ohh ,  so ?  
so !  so we &apos;ve got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong !  
 hey !   joey and it reads ,   &quot; warning !  intruder !  if you see this creep  -  call the cops !  &quot; ) you should check this out ,  tell the other tenants .  apparently he &apos;s running around looking for some kind of a hot girl .  
 who isn &apos;t ?   
i don &apos;t ,  i don &apos;t think we &apos;ve meet .  i - i &apos;m ross .  
nevermind !   mean you had just moved in .  
i had just moved in .  thank you !  listen umm 
jen ,  i know this may sound a little  but uh ,  would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime ,  or 
sure !  that would be nice .  
umm ?  
oh !  my number is on there .   give me a call .  
i will give you a call .  
i &apos;ll see you later .   
okay !   
that was amazing !  
phoebe and gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner .  
that was amazing .  
we are the hottest !  huh ?  no one is hotter than we are !  you &apos;re the best .  
no ,  you &apos;re the best .  
no ,  you &apos;re the best .  
no ,  you &apos;re the best .  
i am the best .   
 hey guys !   what  &apos;cha been doin &apos; ?   
 hey joey !  isn &apos;t that the girl that waved at you the other day ?  
i don &apos;t know .  but i can see through your sheet .   yeah ,  yeah ,  that &apos;s her .  but y &apos;know what ?  doesn &apos;t matter ,  i &apos;m never gonna get to meet her anyway .  
why ?  
because it &apos;s impossible to find her apartment !  she lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe ,  or something .  
what are you talking about ?   she obviously lives on the second floor ,  seventh apartment from the left !  
no .  no .  no .  she lives on the third floor ,  eighth apartment from the left .  
no ,  those first two windows ,   that &apos;s the lobby .  and y &apos;know the other one over there ,  that &apos;s the stairway .  you &apos;ve been counting wrong .  
so uhh ,  you ready ?  
sure ,  i &apos;ll just get my coat .   could you get that ?  
sure .   joey 
ah ,  first ,  i - i would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again .  meeting is being videotaped .  
 okay .  umm ,  well ,  first i would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh ,  for yelling at you .  
now you &apos;re probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah ,   who did ,  who did not umm ,  yell at you and storm out ,  and i think that &apos;s a big mistake and here &apos;s why .  i made a huge fool of myself and i came back ,  that shows courage .  when i thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job ,  i said no .  that shows integrity .  and ,  i was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage .   okay umm ,  now i know i already said courage ,  but y &apos;know you gotta have courage .  and umm ,  and finally when i thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace ,  i said no and i was not litigious .  {by the way ,  litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against .  so she didn &apos;t want to sue him .  don &apos;t worry ,  i had to look it up too . } so there you go ,  you got ,  you got  courage ,  you got integrity ,  you got  courage again ,  and not litigious .  look mr 
zelner !  right !  i knew that !  i really ,  really want this job and i think ,  i think i would be really good at it .  
 oh !  you are ?  
really ?  oh thank you !  oh oh ,  would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug ?  
you tired chandler ?  
you better believe he &apos;s tired ,  after the day we had !  if you know what i mean .  you know what i mean ?  
honey ,  the tortilla chips know what you mean .  
so uh chandler ,  you like that badge i got you ?  
oh yeah ,  it &apos;s so cool .   now i gotta go ,  officer bing has gotta ,  10 - 100 .   that &apos;s pee - pee .   
phoebe ,  you have a ,  a twig in your hair .  
ohh ,   umm ,  we kinda took a little detour on the way over here .  
yeah ,  we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around ,  so 
you didn &apos;t !  
we did !  we violated section 12 paragraph 7 of the criminal code !  
the park huh ?  a public place .  
uh - huh .  
i hear ya .  excuse me for just a second !    
hi chandler .  
monica !  this is the men &apos;s room !   isn &apos;t it ?  
yes it is .  you see i &apos;ve always found the men &apos;s bathroom very sexual .  haven &apos;t you ?  
no .  and if i did ,  i don &apos;t think we &apos;d be going out .  monica ,  this is getting ridiculous !  
come on ,  we can &apos;t let them win !  
ugh ,  we have already proved that we are hot !  okay ?  so why - why are you getting so obsessed about this thing ?  !  
because phoebe and gary are in that - can &apos;t - keep - their - hands - off - each - other - doing - it - in - the - park phase !  
 so ?  
i feel really sad that we &apos;re not really there anymore .  
oh wow !  is that what this all have been about ?  
wasn &apos;t it a lot more exciting when we were y &apos;know all over each other all the time ?  
yeah that was great .  that was really great !  but to tell you the truth ,  i &apos;m more excited about where we are right now .  
really ?  
yeah !  i &apos;ve never been in a relationship that &apos;s lasted this long before .  y &apos;know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time ,  i think that &apos;s pretty incredible .  and the fact that this is happening all with you ,  yeah i think that &apos;s pretty exciting .   
that is so sweet .  i know that i was acting a little crazy but umm ,  i feel the same way .  
yeah ?  
yeah .   
y &apos;know what i just realized ?  you just freaked out about our relationship .  
did not .  
yes you did !  admit it !  you freaked out !  
okay ,  i freaked out a little .  
little ?  !  you freaked out big time !  okay ?  and i fixed it !  we have switched places !  i am the relationship and king and you are the crazy ,  irrational screw up !   and now we &apos;re back .  ending credits

what are you talking about ?  !  
 well ,  it &apos;s not for sure but umm ,  we met this guy in the park who thought ben was really cute -  - y &apos;know ,  which he is -  - so umm anyhoo ,  he uh ,  he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he &apos;s auditioning .  
 whoa !  this guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town !   ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition !  !   i mean ,  way to go ben !   man !  i &apos;ve been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition .  
i know ,  it &apos;s crazy !  we were just pushing ben on the swings 
i &apos;m always on the swings !  what am i doing wrong ?  !  
 okay ,  gotta go !  wish me luck !  
luck !  
hey rach ,  now that you &apos;re working at ralph lauren ,  can you bring me back some of those polo shirts ?  
uh well ,  y &apos;know what ?  i don &apos;t think if i feel comfortable stealing on my very first day 
unwilling to steal from work ,  interesting .  
besides ,  if anybody &apos;s gonna get free stuff ,  it &apos;s gonna be me .  
okay guys ,  way to wish me luck !  
good luck !  go get  &apos;em !   
okay ,  let &apos;s discuss rachel &apos;s birthday .  i say we throw a surprise party this weekend .  
whoa - whoa ,  but her birthday isn &apos;t like for another month .  
yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday ,  then it &apos;s not a surprise .  
i think it &apos;s a great idea .  yeah ,  we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends .  
ross !  !  we &apos;re having a surprise party for rachel !  !  
 okay !  !  
done .  
okay ,  great so do you want to do it together ?  
i would love to do it together !   
they &apos;re gonna do it together .  
dude !  that &apos;s my girlfriend !  
what ,  so i gotta shut it down now ?  
all right ,  i gotta take off .  i &apos;m picking up ben then we &apos;re off to the big audition .  
it &apos;s gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be ben &apos;s dad .  
yeah .  
weirder than watching his two moms make out ?   
whoa - whoa dad ?  there &apos;s a dad in the commercial ?  
yeah the dad and ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it .  
whoa ,  hey ,  maybe i &apos;ll go down there with ya and see if i can get an audition to play the dad .  i mean who better to play ben &apos;s father than his godfather .  
you &apos;re not his godfather .  
what ?  !  are you kidding ?  !  
 of course i am !   okay ,  let &apos;s go godfather .  
hey !  i &apos;m in ,  they &apos;re gonna let me audition !  
really ?  that &apos;s great !  
i know !  i know !  it turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play ,  so i steered clear of her 
 hey ,  that kid looks familiar .  
oh yeah ,  yeah !  he &apos;s done tons of commercials .  i &apos;ve seen him in like sugar smacks ,  playstation ,  and that one for the phone company .  in fact he was so good in that one ,  he actually convinced me to switch phone companies .  chandler was mad  .  
yeah well ,  he &apos;s not gonna get this one .  ben is way cuter than that kid .  i mean look at him ,  look at you ,   
that &apos;s great .  listen ,  wouldn &apos;t it be great though if i got to play ben &apos;s dad ?  
joey ,  you look nothing like ben .  
i look more like him than you do !   
so it &apos;s down to these two ,  nancy i know you like this one and i think i agree .  rachel ,  what do you think ?  
well umm ,  that one is pretty but uh ,  i just ,  i just love this fabric  sorry .  
oh don &apos;t be sorry ,  that &apos;s part of your job here to give your opinions and then i take credit for them -  - i &apos;m kidding .  
she is kidding ,  but don &apos;t ever disagree with her again .  okay ,  now i &apos;m kidding !  
 oh ,  what a fun office .  
i don &apos;t know which one ,  but i do know i need a cigarette .  so what do you say we take a break ,  we go outside ,  and we &apos;ll figure this out when we come back ?   
 rachel ?  do you smoke ?  
and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me !  
that doesn &apos;t seem fair .  
i know !  it &apos;s like i &apos;m being punished for not having this disgusting ,  poisoning habit !  
yeah ,  it is the best .  
i mean what if this keeps happening ?  y &apos;know ,  they &apos;ll - they &apos;ll be outside smoking ,  making all the decisions and i &apos;ll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air ,  y &apos;know ?  and then when the day comes when kim wants to promote one of us ,  who do you think she &apos;s gonna pick ?  me or smokey smokerson ?  
rachel ,  you can go down there ,  you don &apos;t have to smoke .  just say you wanna get some fresh air .  
yeah ,  i can do that .  
yeah ,  or you can do the easy thing and smoke .

 i think on some level ,  you - you sabotaged your own audition so that ben would get the part .  
well ,  you &apos;re way sounds a lot better than mine .   yeah .  yeah !  it &apos;s not that i &apos;m a bad actor

uhh ,  no ,  no ,  it bothered me when he slept with other women .  
and thank you ,  for that .

okay ,  i &apos;ve already taught you so much already ,  but whatever .  see when you flirt with a guy you think ,   &quot; i &apos;m just flirting ,  no big deal .  &quot;  but the guy is thinking ,   &quot; finally !  somebody who wants to sleep with me !  &quot;  
no way !  
it &apos;s true .  
well that &apos;s pathetic !  
again true .  
and this goes for all guys ?

 nooo !  
 i know !  
well thank god you were here !  i mean ,  we have to erase that !  
what ?  !  we can &apos;t do that !  
we have too !  i mean what if ross &apos;s hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together ?  is that what you want ?  ross back with that controlling ,  neurotic ,  crazy emily ?  the emily that wouldn &apos;t let him see you ?  
noo !  oh no !  no !  god no !  he should not get back together with her .  i know that !  you know that !  even ross knows that !  but that still doesnt give us the right to erase his message !  
i &apos;m his sister ,  okay ?  i love him !  i don &apos;t want to see him get hurt !  come on !  doesnt that give me the right to control himhelp him ?  
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s the one who needs help .   
no ,  look ,  she &apos;s obviously unstable ,  okay ?  i mean she &apos;s thinking about running out on her wedding day .   okay ,  fine !  but i mean ,  look at the position she &apos;s putting him in !  what &apos;s he gonna do ?  ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage ?  !  i mean ,  who would do that ?  !   okay ,  fine ,  all right ,  but that &apos;s y &apos;know ,  it &apos;s different !  although it did involve a lot of the same people .  
ugh !  
y &apos;know what ,  this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she &apos;s trying to play on him .  
okay ,  you are crazy !  i &apos;m sorry ,  but she sounded generally upset !  i mean ,  listen !   
your messages have been erased .  
okay ,  y &apos;know ,  we - we &apos;re safe right ?  i mean nothing bad can go down !  
no .  but that reminds me ,   sign this .

oh it &apos;s nothing ,  it just says that you can &apos;t sue the city if you scrap your knee or y &apos;know ,  get your head blown off .  
 oh ,  hurry up .  i want to sign that .  
okay ,  here he comes .  what is he doing ?  what the hell is he doing ?  !

no ,  monica !  monica !  we have to fix this !  
there &apos;s nothing we can do .  you erased the message !  
yeah well unless we tell him .  
well ,  if you &apos;re gonna be totally rational about this ,  i can &apos;t argue with you !  all right ?  fine ,  if you wanna tell him ,  tell him .  i just don &apos;t want to be a part of it .   
oh ,  maybe that &apos;s emily calling back to leave the exact same message .  
 hey ross !  it &apos;s you !  i just want you to remember this feeling .  you are lucky to be alive !  so live everyday to the fullest .  love yourself ,  okay ?  okay .  oh ,  and also get stamps .  bye !   
wow !  play that message for emily and this whole problem goes away !  
hey ,  anybody want to meet a hero ?

pheebs ,  we had the most incredible night !  okay ,  so ,  we &apos;re in the car 
wait !  hold on !   hi !  
hi !  
 okay ,  go ahead .  
okay ,  okay ,  so we &apos;re in the car .  right ?  and bang !  a shot was fired .  and joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me !  
my god ,  joey !  
 it was a car backfire !  
yeah ,  but - but he didn &apos;t know that !  
yeah ,  i didn &apos;t know that .  
and it could &apos;ve just as easily have been a bullet .  
hey joe ,  you ever think about joining the force ?  we could use a guy like you .  
who jumps at loud noises !  
wow !  i could &apos;ve died tonight .  
yeah !  if the car that backfired had run over you !  y &apos;know what ,  i think i &apos;ll go home before ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life .   
i do have a newfound respect for life .  
 oh my god !   
 so you wanna get some dinner ?  
yeah !  sure !  yep !   oh ,  y &apos;know what ?  if i heard a shot right now ,  i &apos;d throw my body on you .  
oh yeah ?  well maybe you and i should take a walk through a bad neighborhood .  
okay !  
all right .  
bye !   
dude !  how come you took off ?  
oh ,  i just went for a walk ,  around the living room .  whatever 
is something wrong ?  
no .  no i &apos;m just tired .  y &apos;know ,  from - from the walk .  
okay .  
you dove in front of ross !  ross !  
that &apos;s what this is about !  oh my god ,  you hate ross !  
i do not hate ross !  
of course you do !  i saved him !  you &apos;re mad at me !  it all adds up !  you want ross out of the picture .  
what picture ?  
i don &apos;t know ,  but i don &apos;t like what i &apos;m hearing !  
look i &apos;m very glad that you saved ross from the car backfire ,  but y &apos;know ,  it could &apos;ve been a bullet and you y &apos;know ,  you didn &apos;t try to save me !  
ohh ,  you &apos;re upset because you think i chose ross over you !  no !  i knew you could take care of yourself .  y &apos;know ,  i mean ross ,  he need help .  he &apos;s not street like us !  
when it comes down to it ,  you would risk your life for ross before you would for me .  that &apos;s the bottom line .  
well ,  no ,  not exactly !  all right ,  look ,  i ,  i wasn &apos;t trying to save ross .  okay ?  my sandwich was next to ross .  all right ?  i was ,  i was trying to save my sandwich .  
from a bullet !  
i know it doesn &apos;t make much sense 
much sense ?  !  
look chandler ,  it was instinct !  okay ?  i just went for it !  
so you risked your life ,  for a sandwich !  
i know it sounds crazy ,  but chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world !  
so you didn &apos;t uh ,  choose ross before me .  
no !  i would never do that !  you - you &apos;re like my brother !  
really ?  !  
yeah !  in fact ,  to prove how much you mean to me ,   here .  
thanks .   
no ,  eh ,  oh - oi ,  easy ,  it &apos;s not a hot dog !   
how good is that ?  
 oh - oi - ho ,  yeah !  
see ?  
hm - hmm .   
oh - whoa - hey ,  dude ,  what are you doing ?  !  
i thought you were showing me how much you mean to me .  
hey !  hi !  
rach ,  what uh ,  what are you doing here ?  
hey !  y &apos;know what ?  you are in our apartment all the time !  okay ?  this is ,  this is just a drop in the bucket mister !  
y &apos;know ,  it - it doesn &apos;t matter .  the important thing is that you &apos;re here .  you &apos;re my friend ,  and you &apos;re here .  oh !   
okay ,  just a little scared .  what &apos;s going on ross ?  
the most amazing thing happened tonight .  i thought my number was up .  i had an actual near death experience !  
what ?  !  what ?  what happened ?  !  
okay ,  okay ,  we were on the ride along with gary ,  right ?  
yeah !  
and somebody took a shot at me !  
 really ?  !  
no ,  a car backfired ,  but  i thought somebody was taking a shot at me .  and rach ,  i i survived !  and i was filled with this - this great respect for life .  y &apos;know ?  i - i want to experience every moment .  i want to seize every opportunity .  i - i am seeing everything so - so clearly now .  
because a car backfired ?  
 okay ,  why are you here ?  
well ,  i - i - i don &apos;t know how this fits into your whole  &quot; seizing &quot;  thing but um ,  emily called you today .  
you talked to her ?  
no ,  she left a message .   but it - it kinda got erased .  there &apos;s just  something wrong with your machine .  
well ,  okay ,  what - what did she say ?  
well ,  uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh ,  she wants you to call her .  
wow !  
now ,  that - that was a good thing that i told you ,  right ?  
huh ?  yeah !  yes ,  of course !  
okay .  thank you !  thank you !  becausei &apos;m sorry ,  all right .  because y &apos;know what ?  she didn &apos;t want menot important .  the point is ,  i was right .  your decision .  okay ?  i was right .   your decision .  
right .  i guess ,  i guess i should call emily .  
okay ,  no ,  that &apos;s not the right decision .  that &apos;s not ,  that &apos;s not right ,  no ross - ross ,  come on !  i mean ,  that woman made you miserable !  okay ,  ross ,  do you really want to get back into that ?  
okay ,  look ,  yesterday i would &apos;ve even considered calling her back ,  but my ex - wife calls on the same day i have a near death experience .  i mean ,  that - that has got to mean something !  
ugh ,  ross !  that was not a near death experience !  that was barely an experience !  
you weren &apos;t there !  okay ,  maybe this is something that i - i &apos;m supposed to seize !  y &apos;know ?  
okay ,  y &apos;know what ?  maybe ,  this is not about seizing stuff .  maybe this is about escaping stuff .  
huh .  
i mean ,  look - look today you escaped  death ,  y &apos;know ?  and maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with emily ?  
that does make sense .  because i do wanna seize some opportunity ,  but i - i really don &apos;t wanna see or talk to her .  
well ,  there you go !  
yeah .  maybe today is just ,  close call day .  
 close call day .  
hey ,  thanks rach .   
ohh ,  honey no problem .  okay .   
oh wait - wait - wait !  the message is blinking .  maybe you didn &apos;t erase it .  
oh ?   
  &quot; hey ross ,  it &apos;s you !  &quot;   oh yeah ,  no that &apos;s - that &apos;s an old message ,  nobody needs to hear that .  
no .   
 hey umm ,  was - was monica here ?  
yeah .  
yeah ,  i want my money back .  
hey pheebs ,  has gary ever been shot at for real ?  
yes .  once .  yeah ,  a little .  he kinda did it to himself .  it &apos;s not really a good story .  
i wonder how i would react under fire ,  y &apos;know ?  and not backfire but - but heavy fire ,  like i was in a war or something .  
man ,  i would be great in a war !  i mean ,  i really ,  i think i would make a fantastic military leader .  i mean i know i would make general way before any of you guys .  
before or after you were shot by your own troops ?  
i know where joey would be .  he would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us .  
yes ,  if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches .  
yeah ,  hero sandwiches .   
 would you like some more coffee ,  baby - doll ?  
i &apos;m fine ,  thanks .  
 yeah ,  see ,  i can &apos;t pull of baby - doll can i ?  
no .  i think we learned that from the sugarlips incident .  i &apos;m gonna get some tea .  
okay .   
hiya doin &apos; pumpkin ?  
nope .    
so it looks like it &apos;s going really well for you two ,  huh ?  
i know ,  really well .  in fact ,  i &apos;m gonna ask phoebe to move in with me .  
 oh my god !  
what do you ,  what do you think ?  
i think that is so great !  when are you gonna ask her ?  
tonight ,  but don &apos;t say anything .  okay ?  
i swear ,  i promise .  i promise .  oh my god ,  i &apos;m so excited !  {and i just can &apos;t hide it !  i &apos;m about to lose control and i think i like it !  sorry ,  just couldn &apos;t resist it . } all right ,  listen let me tell you ,  do not get her flowers .  okay ?  because y &apos;know ,  she cries when they die ,  and there &apos;s the whole funeral 
 i &apos;ll see you after work sweetie .   
okay .  bye !   
so ,  what movie should we see ?  
 gary &apos;s gonna ask you to move in with him !  !  
what ?  !  really ?  !  
he just told me at the counter .  he made me promise not to tell ,  but i couldn &apos;t hold it in any longer !  
i can &apos;t believe this !  
 right ,  because it &apos;s fast .  because ,  it &apos;s so fast .  it &apos;s fast !  
relax !  it &apos;s phoebe !  not you !  
oh !  good for you pheebs ,  way to go !   
no ,  but it is fast .  isn &apos;t it ?  
ohhhh !  
no ,  i like him a lot but i don &apos;t think i &apos;m ready for this !  
so ,  what are you gonna do ?  
i don &apos;t know .  i &apos;ll just handle iti &apos;ll ask you to talk to him !  
me ?  !  why me ?  
because you are so afraid of commitment !  you talk to him ,  make him scared like you !  make him a man !  
i &apos;ll try ,  but i &apos;m not sure what good it would do ,  y &apos;know ?  because i &apos;m a lot less afraid of commitment than i used to be .  
that is so sweet !   
hey ross ,  is uh ,  is staten island really an island ?  
uh - huh ,  that &apos;s why they call it staten island .  
ohhh .  i thought it was like long island .  
 also an island .   
hey ,  what time is it ?  
 .  
wow !  you realize that we &apos;ve been throwing this ball ,  without dropping it ,  for like an hour ?  
are you serious ?  !  
yeah .  i realized it about a half - hour ago but i didn &apos;t want to say anything  &apos;cause i didn &apos;t want to jinx it .  
wow !  we are pretty good at this !  hey !  we totally forgot about lunch !  
oh ,  i - i ,  i think that &apos;s the first time i ever missed a meal !   yeah ,  my pants are a little loose !  
 hey ,  you guys 
hey !  
is monica here ?  
all right listen umm ,  i just bought something i &apos;m not sure she &apos;s gonna like it ,  and it &apos;s gonna seem a little crazy ,  but this is something that i wanted since i was a little girl .  
you bought shawn cassidy !  
noo !  i wish !  okay ,  you ready ?  
okay !   check it out !   
what - what is it ?  !  
what the hell is that ?  !  !  
it &apos;s a ,  it &apos;s a cat !  
that ,  is not a cat !  {i have to agree with joey on this one . } 
yes it is !  
why is it inside out ?  !  
excuse me !  but this is a purebred ,  show - quality sphinx cat !  
how much did you pay for that ?  
well ,  it was a little extravagant ,  but i a pretty good deal .  
yeah ?  how much ?  
a thousand bucks .  
on a cat ?  ?  !  !  !  !  
it &apos;s not a cat !  
all right listen ball boys !  my grandmother had one of these when i was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing !  i mean it was so cute ,  it would sit in my lap and purr all day long ,  and i would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it !  
free cats do that too ,  y &apos;know .  {which reminds me ,  if i might get a little political here ,  support your local animal shelter .  pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from ,  you get a much better deal from the shelter ,  plus they probably won &apos;t die on you in a week and a half .  if you want a leash ,  go to the pet shop .  if you want the dog for that leash ,  go to the shelter and save it &apos;s life .  now back to regularly scheduled programming . } 
it &apos;s not a cat !  
ugh !  look you guys ,  i &apos;m really excited about this !  okay ?  i don &apos;t care what you think !  i &apos;m gonna go set up a little litter box for mrs .  whiskerson .   well ,  what am i gonna call her ?  fluffy ?  !   
 hey ,  you wanna get something to eat or uh ,  do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth ?  huh ?  
uhh ,  the ball thing .  
yeah ?  
hey ross ,  wouldn &apos;t it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it ?  !  
uhh ,  yeah it would !  let &apos;s do it !  
okay !   
 uh - oh .  
what ?  
i have to pee .  and rachel &apos;s in the bathroom !   
man ,  i didn &apos;t think we were gonna make it !  
hey ladies !  what are you in here for ?   
hey chandler ,  what are you doing here ?  
gary ,  i &apos;m here to report a crime .  
yeah ?  
it is a crime that you and i don &apos;t spend more time together .  
 what &apos;s up ?  
well ,  i heard that you thinking about asking phoebe to move in with you and i thought maybe ,  we should have a talk .  man to uh ,  me .  
sure .  okay .  
uh ,  are you crazy ?  are you insane ?  if you live with phoebe ,  you two are gonna be y &apos;know ,  live - living together !  
yeah ,  i - i considered that .  i just know it would make me happy .  
you mean scared .  
no ,  i mean happy .  
scared ?  happy ?  
chandler ,  what - what are you doing ?  
i am trying to open your eyes ,  my man !  don &apos;t you see ,  if you lived with phoebe she &apos;s always gonna be there .  you &apos;re gonna get home ,  she &apos;s there .  you go to bed ,  she &apos;s there .  you wake up and oh yes ,  she &apos;s there !  
i know !  i can &apos;t wait !  
were you &apos;re parents happy ,  or something ?  
listen chandler ,  the way i see it is that i was lucky enough to find someone that i really love .  i justi wanna be around her as much as i can .  
wow ,  y &apos;know when you say it ,  it doesn &apos;t sound so scary .  
so you know what i &apos;m talking about ,  right ?  
yeah ,  i think i do !  y &apos;know what ?  you move in with her !  you move in with her right now !  maybe i should in with monica !  
no ,  it &apos;s too soon for you guys .  
now when they found the remains of the mesozoic mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a paleozoic amphibian in its jaws !  how did it get there ?  !  {y &apos;know ,  sometimes i think the script writers throw in a line like that to try to trip me up .  but it won &apos;t work .  i &apos;ll always have the last laugh !  <manical_laugh . wav> okay ,  so maybe i &apos;m a little deluded ,  it &apos;s probably just my spellchecker .  but ,  i must admit i did get mesozoic and paleozoic on the first attempt .  yay me !  anyhoo } 
maybe this should be more of a quiet game .  {oh ,  all right !  geez ,  i can &apos;t have any fun ! } 
 hey guys !  
hi !

doesn &apos;t sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat .

so ,  why don &apos;t you just take it back to where you got it ?  
i tried !  they won &apos;t take her back .

i love you .  {there &apos;s another continuity error here .  before monica says i love you ,  chandler &apos;s holding the vests so that you couldn &apos;t see the collar ,  you could see all three ,  and they were folding nicely .  after she says the line and the camera cuts back to chandler ,  you can only see two out of the three ,  you can see the collar of the top one ,  and it looks like it was folded sloppily ,  unlike before .  hey ,  you notice things while spending this much time on this ! } 
man ,  i wish ross was coming with us !  y &apos;know ?  i &apos;m gonna miss him !  
thanks a lot !  i just got that jerk out of my mind !  
hey ,  so where are we staying ?  is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite ?  
uh no ,  not really .  it &apos;s an independent film y &apos;know ?  so we don &apos;t have a real big budget .  i figured i &apos;d just stay in your room .  
i see ,  but once you get your first paycheck you &apos;ll be springing a big hotel suite ,  right ?  i mean ,  lead in a movie ,  they must be paying you a lot ?  
oh yeah !  for every dollar shutter speed makes ,  one penny of it goes right in joey &apos;s pocket .  
so you don &apos;t get paid unless the movie makes money ?  
did you not hear the plot of the movie ?   &quot; she &apos;s been dead for ten years .  &quot;  i &apos;m gonna be a millionaire !

naked alone time .  
no !  phoebe just because i &apos;m alone doesnt mean i wanna walk around naked .  i mean ,  you live alone ,  you don &apos;t walk around naked .

once you know the stories ,  its not that bad .  first marriage ,  wifes hidden sexuality ,  not my fault .  second marriage ,  said the wrong name at the altar ,  a little my fault .  third marriage ,  well they really shouldnt allow you to get married when youre that drunk and have writing all over your face ,  nevadas fault .  
okay ,  so what do you think ladies ?  who wouldnt be interested ?  who wouldnt want to date him ?  
well the divorces dont bother me ,  id date him .  but ,  not while hes still married .  
okay ,  what about you ?   wouldnt you want a date ?  
actually ,  im dating at all anymore .  see ,  i figured out that i was only dating guys that were like yknow bad for me ,  so until i work that out 
 whatever !  what about you meg ?  
well ,  i dont care about the divorces either ,  but i wouldnt date him .  its just that hes obviously still in love with this rachel girl .  
what ?  !  
 she said ,   &quot; hes obviously still in love with this rachel girl .  &quot;   
this is crazy !  i mean ,  yes - yes rachel is my good friend and i - i have loved her in the past ,  but now ,  she is just my wife !  phoebe ,  will you - will you help me out here ?  
well ,  i thought you loved her when you - when you married her .  
we were drunk !  i wouldve married uh ,  joey with that amount of alcohol !  
hey !  you could do a lot worse than joey tribbiani !  !  
 look ,  im sorry ,  but you guys are wrong .  i just dont want to be divorced three times .  
yes ,  and now hes using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her .  i must say ,   &quot; well done !  &quot;  bravo meg .  
 okay !  fine !  fine !  if - if this is what you think ,  forget about the whole three divorce thing !  okay ,  i - ill go to my lawyers office right now and get this marriage annulled !  okay ?  !  because she means nothing to me !  nothnothing !  !  
okay now i wouldnt date you because you seem a little creepy .

um - hmm .  
umm ,  when i said that uh ,  that chandler and i wanted to umm ,  live together we meant alone together .  
 oh my god !  oh ,  thats funny ,  i cant believe i did that .

monica ,  where did you get these ?  !

look ,  im just gonna be across the hall ,  we can still do all the same stuff .  
yeah but we wont be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future .  
not once did we do that .  
 hi .  
hey !  
hi .  
so i ,  i told rachel it was just gonna be the two of us .  
oh yeah ?  well ,  howd she take it ?  
really well .  yeah .  surprisingly well .  yeah ,  she didnt cry .  she wasnt angry or sad .   
and youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry ?  
i mean ,  all im asking for is just a little emotion !  is that too much to ask after six years ?  !  i mean what ?  are - are - are rachel and i not as close as you guys ?  !  i mean do we not have as much fun ?  !  dont i deserve a few tears ?  !  !  i mean we - we told joey ,  he cried his eyes out !  
hey !  i did not cry my eyes out !  !  come on !  its like the end of an era !  no more j - man and channies !  !  
you got married again .  
yes .  
so thats your second marriage in two years .  
yes ,  second in two years .  third overall .  
ross ,  i have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had i so much business from one client .  why dont you tell me what happened .  
basically ,  rachel and i were in vegas and we got drunk 
 im sorry ,  is this the same rachel whos name you said at the altar in the second marriage ?  
yes - yes - yes !  but ,  i - i do not love her .  
oh ,  thats better then .  
this was just a drunken mistake and i need to get it annulled .  
i see .  have you considered therapy ?  
i think just the annulment for today .  
there are a couple of forms to fill out .  
easy .  
and well need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh ,  sound mind .  
no problem .  
and well need you and rachel to testify before a judge .  
ooh !  theres no way to do this without her ?  cause i kinda all ready told her uh ,  it was ,  it was already taken care of .  
of course you did .  look ross ,  you cant get an annulment unless you and rachel are both there .  
hey !  
hey .  so um ,  i was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff .  
okay !  
yknow ,  no point in dragging it out .  dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore .  
okay .  
hey rach ,  what about this ?   huh ?  who - who gets this ?  see ,  i dont know if i want it because it might be yknow ,  too many memories !  
 what the hell is that ?  
i dont know .   hey ,  rachel ,  you want the big plate ?  i want you to have the big plate .  
wow !  mon ,  thanks !  i love this plate !  
something to remember me by !  
mon ,  honey youre not dying .  im just moving out .  yknow ,  i mean were gonna see each other all the time .  
but still ,  its a big change .  the end of an era ,  you might say !  
are you okay ?  youre not blinking .  
im fine !  i just ,  im thinking how much its an end of era .  
oh ,  all right .  but yknow i gotta say ,  i dont ,  i dont think six years counts as an era .  
an era is defined as a significant period of time .  now ,  it was significant to me ,  maybe it wasnt significant to you !  
what is the matter with you ?  !  
what is the matter with you ?  !  !  why arent you more upset ?  !  arent you gonna be sad that were not gonna be living together anymore ?  !  i mean arent you gonna miss me at all ?  !  
all right ,  fine ,  but dont get mad at me .  its - its just a little hard to believe .  
whats hard to believe ?  
well yknow ,  its you guys .  you - you do this kind of stuff !  yknow ?  i mean ,  you - you were gonna get married in vegas and then you backed out !  i guess im not upset because i dont see you guys going through with it .  im sorry .  
rachel ,  its going to happen .  chandler is gonna move in here .  
but i 
no - no ,  wait !  just let me finish ,  okay ?  this isnt something that we just ,  we just impulsively decided in - in vegas ,  this is something we both really want .  and it is going to happen .  
it is ?  really ?  
yeah ,  sweetie .  
 i mean were not ,  were not gonna live together anymore ?  
no .  
what ?  oh my god !  im gonna miss you so much !   
im gonna miss you !   
i mean its the end of an era !  
 okay ,  bye !  
oh no .  
so ?  did you get the annulment ?  
i couldnt .  
i knew it !  because you love rachel .  
its not that .  okay ?  annulments are more complicated than i 
yeah ,  complicated cause of the love .  
i i do ,  i do not love rachel .  im gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible .  okay ?  would i do that if i loved her ?  
ive never been more convinced of your love for her .  
i do not have feelings for rachel !  okay ?  !    
ohh ,  whats wrong ?  !  
monica and chandler are really moving in here and i have to move out and everything is changing .  
oh mycome here !  come here !   its okay .  everythings gonna be okay .  
thank you .  
so ,  ross and rachel got married ,  monica and chandler almost got married ,  do you think you and i should hook up ?  
oh we do ,  but not just yet .  
really ?  !  well ,  when ?  
okay umm ,  well ,  first chandler and monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way .  yeah .  but it wont work out .  
wow .  
i know .  then ,  im gonna marry chandler for the money and youll marry rachel and have the beautiful kids .  
great !  
but then we ditch those two and thats when we get married .  well have chandlers money and rachels kids and getting custody will be easy because of rachels drinking problem .  
oh - oh ,  what about ross ?  
 hey !  
hey !  check it out !  this is unbelievable !  joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes !   
 dude !  what are yoyou trying to kill me ?  !  
 pheebs ,  i wanna ask you something .  
uh - huh ,  what ?  
well since im movin out and - and youre so beautiful 
oh !  
how about i move in with you ?  
well ,  that would be great but then what do we do about denise ?  
whos denise ?  
my roommate .  
you have a roommate ?  !  
yes ,  denise .  denise !  
hey ,  what is with the secrecy phoebe ?  huh ?  and what about this denise ,  is she cute ?  
pheebs ,  i dont understand .  how can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about ?  
maybe because you never listen to anything that i say .  i talk about her all the time !  denise !  !  !  !  !  
hey rach ,  listen i was thinkin uh ,  im gonna have an extra room over at my place 
oh ,  thats true .  
yeah ,  why dont you move in with me ?  itll be great !  we could stay up late ,  watch movies ,  and you know about naked thursdays right ?  
yeah ,  yeah i think im gonna find my own place .  
hey .  
hey !  
so ,  what did rachel say when you told her you were still married to her ?  
oh ,  that .  umm ,  she took it really well .  
you didnt tell her did you ?  
no .  
of course not ,  because youre in love with her .  
i am not in love with her .  she was very upset about having to move out so i eh ,  didnt tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset .  i - i just comforted her ,  as a friend .  
what do you mean ,  comforted her ?  
its nothing ,  i just gave her a hug .  
ah - ha !  a classic sign of love ,  the hug !  
its also a sign of friendship .  
yeah ,  not in your case lovey loverson .   
 it was a hug !  
okay ,  just tell me this ,  did you or did you not smell her hair ?  
s - s - smell her hair ?  what if i did ?  
ninety percent of a womens pheromones come out the top of her head !  thats why ,  thats why women are shorter .  so that men will fall in love when they hug them !   oh come on ross ,  youre a scientist .  
i was hugging her as a friend .  its not my fault her - her hair got in my face ,  shes got a lot of it and it smells all - all uh coconutty .   what ?  !  oh ,  that doesnt mean i have feelings for rachel !  maybe it means i have feelings for coconuts !  
 okay ,  whatever you say .  but just be careful ,  all right ?  rachels not in the same place you are .  
 if the place you are referring too is being in love ,  then she is in the same place as me because i am not in that place !  
hey !   dude ,  some guy just called for you .  
who was it ?  
i dont know !  how about ,   &quot; thanks for taking the message .  &quot;  jeez !   
okay listen ,  yknow when you move in rachels room is gonna be empty ,  you wanna talk about what we want to do with it ?  
sure !  
okay ,  i was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room ,  right ?  with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time !  and we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here !  !  okay ,  whatever ,  i really havent thought about it that much .  
well ,  i like that idea .  obviously !  i was thinking maybe - maybe - maybe it could be a game room ,  yknow ?  i mean you can buy old arcade games like uh ,  like space invaders and asteroids for $200 ,  the real ones !  the big - big ones !  
no .  
okay so you mean no as in ,   &quot; gee chandler ,  what an interesting idea .  lets discuss it before we reject it completely .  &quot;  
oh ,  im sorry .  of course i mean that .  interesting idea ,  umm ,  talk about it ,  but no .

thats a great idea !  we can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room .  
totally !   
we dont have to come up with this now .  
oh good .  
hey ,  yknow what ?  why dont we think about changes we can make in the living room ?

yeah ,  i mean were gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair .   
youre - youre - youre gonna bring the barca lounger over here ?  
is that a problem ?  
well ,  its a set and they should probably stay together .  
oh ,  thats cool .  then ill just bring them both over .  
see now - now youre taking them away from their home .  
okay ,  i get it .  so ,  i get nothing !  nothing here is mine !  everything here is yours !  ill get up in the morning put on your clothes ,  and head off to work !

in the game room !  
look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly !  
 everything on your application looks really goodohh !  just one last question umm ,  are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out ?  
whoa !  !  now look ,  dont be just blurtin stuff out .  i want you to really think about your answers .  okay ?  
 you can call off the roommate search !   hi !  ill be living here .   
oh dont listen to him ,  hes just some guy who really wants the apartment ,  but i dont think hes gonna get it .  
why did you take the shower curtain down ?  
hey !  
hey !  oh listen ,  i was just clearing some space for your stuff .  
oh thanks ,  but listen ,  i was just at monicas and she and chandler had a big fight and theyre not moving in .  
what do you mean ,  theyre not moving in ?  they - theyre still moving in right ?  
no - no ,  they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room .  
what ?  !  over a stupid room !  
yeah ,  i feel kinda bad for them ,  but im also really psyched cause i dont have to move in here !  
whats all this about you guys fighting ?  !  is this really over a room ?  !  i mean ,  that is so silly !  
ross ,  we can handle this .  
well ,  apparently not ,  and i cant just stand by and watch two people i care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly .  i mean ,  enough of the silliness !  
well ,  why dont you tell her to stop being silly !   
 okay - okay !  two very good points ,  look ive known you both a long time ,  and ive never seen either of you one / millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together .  do you really want to throw that all away over a room ?  that is so silly .  now wh - what is more important ,  love or silliness ?  
well ,  we are fond of the silliness ,  but we also have a soft spot for the love .  
love is the best medicine .  
thats laughter .  
why do you do it ?  
i dont know .  
okay !  all right !  now ,  chandler you - you wanna live with monica ,  right ?  
yeah ,  i do .  
and mon ,  you wanna live with chandler ,  dont ya ?  
yes .  
so i understand youre looking for a place .  
no - no ,  im staying put .  
oh ,  i was going to offer you my apartment .  
why ,  where are you going ?  
i dont know .  
 hey rach !  
hi !  
youre never gonna believe it uh ,  monica and chandler are moving in again .  thats great news righti mean for them .  right ?  
oh wow .  
yeah but ,  on the bright side ,  we get to be roommates again .  
yeah .  yknow umm ,  uh ,  umm ,  about that ,  umm ,  ross i really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything ,  but dont you think its gonna be weird ?  
wh - why ?  !  why - why - why would it ,  why would it be weird ?  
well ,  because of us !  because of our history .  
no !  
no ?  
no !  no !  it would be weird if we were still in that place ,  i mean are you still in that place ?  
no !  not at all !  
good !  me neither !  so its not a problem .  were just two friends who happen to be roommates .  
okay ,  but ross ,  eventually you and i are gonna be dating .  
really ?  !  we are ?  
yeah !  im gonna have a boyfriend ,  youre gonna have a girlfriend 
ohh !  that would be great .  
but yknow what ,  if you think its gonna be okay well just work out a system .  yknow ,  itll be like college ,  ill hang a hanger on the door and put a sign ,   &quot; come back later ,  im gettin lucky .  &quot;   
so are you sure about this whole moving in thing ?  !  i mean its a really big step !  and - and whats the rush ?  !   
thats very funny !  
hes being silly ,  because he knows that we enjoy the silliness !  
no ,  i - i - im serious ,  okay ?  i mean ,  think about it .  you move in ,  you start fighting over stupid game rooms ,  next thing yknow you break up !  
ross ,  you were right before ,  it was just a stupid fight about a room .  
okay ,  there are no stupid fights !  !  this isnt about the room ,  this is about what the room represents !  and unfortunately ,  this room  could destroy you !  !  
yeah ,  i &apos;m not so worried .  
yeah ,  no ,  me neither .  
fine !  its your life !   i just dont want to see you guys break up !  which you will do if you move in together ,   but thats what you want ,  theres nothing i can do .   dont do it !  !  !  !  !   
you still want to move in together right ?  
of course !  
ross didnt scare you ?  
scared me out of ever wanting to live with him .  
come here ,  i want to show you something !  
okay !   ,  the coffee table forward  ,  and taped a square outline on the floor . ) 
oh my god !  someones killed square man !

okay !  
yknow those big - big uh ,  road signs that say  &quot; merge ?  &quot;

what are you doing ?  
were just celebrating that joey got his health insurance back .  
i cannot believe that you didnt tell me that we are still married !  !

what ?  
youre kidding !  
 oh my god !  !  
ross !  
okay ,  maybe it wasnt my best decision .  but i just couldnt face another failed marriage .  
okay ,  let me just jump in and ask ,  at what point did you think this was a successful marriage ?  
rach ,  come on ,  if you think about it ,  its actually kinda funny .   okay ,  maybe its best not to think about it .  
okay ,  this is inexcusable .  i am shocked to my very core !  
phoebe ,  i told her you already knew .  
another lie .  you have a sickness !  
oh !  hey ,  somebody left their keys .   ooohh ,  to a porsche !  i had a porsche ,  id have the keys surgically attached to my hand ! } hey gunther ,  these yours ?  
yeah ,  thats what i drive .  i make four bucks an hour ,  i saved up for 350 years !  
na - uh !   hey did anybody lose their keys ?  
joey ,  why dont you put them in the lost and found ?  
theres a lost and found ?   my shoe !   
you left a shoe here ?  !  
well ,  i didnt realize until i got home .  i wasnt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe !  yknow what ?  im gonna go find that guys car and leave a note on the windshield .   
oh good ,  when he comes back for his keys ,  ill be sure to give him your shoe .  
great !  thanks .   
 oh ,  good ,  good ,  you guys are here !  listen ,  how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies ?  !  
oh my god ,  what a fun day !  that sounds great !  
 yeah ,  all right .  
okay ,  well ill bring them by tomorrow morning .  okay ,  and uh ,  by the way ,  theyre not actually puppies ,  theyre frank and alices triplets .  okay ,  see ya !   
whoa - whoa - whoa !  what ?  
 please !  please !  please !  please !  oh please !  please !  please !  frank and alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and im nervous cause ive never done that before by myself !  
dont worry about it phoebe ,  well absolutely do it .  
yeah ,  im gonna pass .  cause i was kinda iffy when it was puppies .  
yeah ,  its not mine .  
 i love your car .  
yeah ,  its  mine .  
i bet its fast .  
me too !  yeah .  and comfortable .  do uh ,  do you like leather seats ?  
yeah !  
so ,  i still have boxes here .  i still have boxes at rosss ,  and i have nowhere to live !  wow .  i could so easily freak out right now .  
what about me ?  i just found out that denise is leaving town for a while ,  i dont have a roommate .  
well ,  maybe - maybe i could be your roommate pheebs .  
maybe you could be my roommate !  
well theres an idea !  !  
yeah !  
that would be great !  wait ,  how long is denise gone for ?  
umm ,  she said shed be back december 26th .  
december 26th ,  huh maybe shes santa clause .   
 oh look who it is ,  my husband .  the apple of my eye .  
okay ,  i got us a court date for tomorrow at and i picked up all the forms .  ill take care of everything .  
well sure ,  if you say youre gonna take care of everything i have no reason to doubt you .  give me those forms !   all right ,  now im gonna do this my way and i dont want to hear a peep out of you !  
okay rach ,  but 
op !  youre peeping !   
ross !  yknow what ,  i just gotwhy ?  why did you do this ?  !  
look i told you 
i dont wanna hear  &quot; three failed marriages !  &quot;  
look ,  if youd had two failed marriages ,  youd understand !  
well ,  yknow what ?  thanks to you im half way there !  ugh !  oh !  i am so mad !  ross ,  i dont think i have ever been this angry !  
what about the time i said we were on a break ?  
pheebs ,  hows it going ?  
 im doing okay .  i think its going well .  do you think theyre having fun ?  am i talking to fast ?  
nope ,  sound like me .  pheebs ,  its going great .  look at chandler with little baby girl chandler .  
little baby girl chandler ,  where i have heard that before ?  oh right ,  coach ruben .   do you know what pheebs ?  when youre done over there ,  we kinda have a situation over here too .   
na - uh ,  no ,  we are all responsible for our own babies .  
see thats where i think that youre wrong .  weve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense .  
what do you mean ?  
i just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone .  phoebe ,  you can be in charge of wiping .  and yknow mon ,  you can be in charge of diapering and i can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around  
that sounds really great ,  but maybe you should be in charge of wiping .  
okay ,  im a rookie .  i should not be in the end zone .  chandler adds the powder ,  begrudgingly ,  and monica puts the diaper on . ] 
this is so great !  this is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant .  
yeah ?   well this is not what i ordered .  
 hey guys !  
hey !  
hey !  
hey babies !  oh ,  im having the best morning .  that uh ,  that porsche ive got the keys too ,  still there !  
shocking !  since you still have the keys .  
you should see the treatment i get when im with that car !  people are friendly; they - they wanna talk ,  and not just about the car !  one guy gave me advice about my equity investments .  
what equity investments ?  
the ones that got me the porsche !  will you keep up !   but i figured ,  if - if people keep seeing me just standing there ,  theyre gonna start to think that i dont own it .  so i figured ill wash it .  right ?  monica ,  you got a bucket and some soap i can borrow ?  
oh yeah ,  i got soap and sponges and rags and carnuba wax and polishing compound .  
you dont even have a car !  
i know .  but umm ,  one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building ,  so i washed it .  
and ?  
and six others .  
yeah ,  she tops out at 130 .  
and thats just in the city .  i get her up to 160 when i take her upstate .  
sure !  
okay ,  take it easy .  
really ?  oh uh ,  oh just give me five more minutes with it .  
oh i - i uh ,  found the keys and now im just polishing her up .  
yeah ,  but its my wax .  dont know if youre crazy or this is some kind of street theater ,  but could i have my keys .  
sure .  here .   ill uh ,  save your parking spot .  
why not ?  
i dont know why i was so nervous about this .  and i dont know why frank and alice are always complaining .  this is so easy .  
yeah ,  two hours ,  a lifetime thats the same .  
 check it out !  check it out !  when the babies wake up ,  they can meet krog !   
chandler ,  what are you doing ?  that thing can put someones eye out !  
he can do more than that !  he can destroy the universe !  
no chandler ,  they can swallow one of those little parts !  and also ,  look at his smooth area ,  thats just gonna mess them up .  
theyre not gonna swallow anything ,  you guys are being way over protective .  when i was a kid ,  my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass !  
what ?  !  
glass ,  sand ,  whatever .   
oh ,  look at little leslie stretching in her sleep .  
oh its so cute .  i wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head .  
oh ,  i can still do that .  
how are you still single ?  !  
 all right .   i thought about it and maybe youre right .  maybe krog is not a safe toy .  
good .  what made you change your mind ?  
i swallowed the sonic blaster gun .  
how did that happen ?  !  !  
well ,  i was trying to prove that i was right .  yknow ?  and it turns out i was wrong .  and now its lodged in my throat .   
okay you two are asking the court for an annulment ?  
yes your honor ,  and here are ,  are forms ,  all filled out .  
so based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that mr . _geller is mentally unstable .  
fine ,  im mentally unstable .  
and based on the fact that mr . _geller is intravenous drug user .  
what ?  !  
uh yes ,  heroin and crack .  
crack isnt even an intravenous drug !  
well ,  you would know .  
now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage ?  
oh ,  come on !  
 ross ,  please ,  i found the magazines !  
and finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage .  well ,  that makes sense since youre gay and addicted to heroin .  
okay ,  im sorry ,  this is insane !  i - i - im not addicted to heroin ,  im not gay ,  and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything !  look ,  ill consummate this marriage right here ,  right now !  
that wont be necessary .  
and when we were dating we consummated like bunnies !  
ugh !  
now if you were two involved in a serious relationship ,  that really creates a problem .  
ross !  your honor ,  rest assured relationship ended like two years ago !   and could you strike  &quot; consummated like bunnies &quot;  from the record ?  
is there ,  anything in this record that is actually true ?  
well ,  yes ,  we got married in vegas and uh ,  and the names i think .  
well ,  based on what i heard ,  you two certainly dont qualify for an annulment .  if you two dont want to be together youll have to file for divorce .  
 thats great !  are you happy now ?  look what you did with your funny ,  funny form !  
 what ?  !  me ?  !  what about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense !  
and whatwhat are you typing that for ?  did you hear what she said ?  we dont get the annulment .  dont type that !  what ?  !  stop typing !   hey !  stop typing !   stop typing !  stop typing !  !  
 okay ,  do you see ,  do you see what youre keeping me married too ?  !  
you need to get out of my chambers .  
all right look lady here is the deal ,  i came here for an annulment and i am not leaving here until i get one !  
yeah !  
would you like to spend the night in jail ?  
 so the porsche guy took his car back .  
but you found the keys to his clothes ?  
no .  no ,  i just uh ,  i just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks i own a porsche .  
and people will think you own a porsche because youre wearing the clothes ?  
of course !  only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car !  right ?  
that is true .  
yeah ,  but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun .  
oh ,  ive been there .  yeah ,  i am gonna go drive my porsche .   
joey ,  you know you dont actually have one .  
come on !  what are you doing ?  !  im in character !  would you talk to her !   
ahh ,  i think it just moved .  its really poking me .  
all right ,  thats it ,  were going to the emergency room .  
what ?  !  no ,  you cant ,  you cant leave me here with them !  were baby - sitting !  
the babies are asleep ,  im sure youll be okay on your own for a while !  
but you - you cant leave me with them !  we - were a team !  were playing a zone !  theyre gonna triple team me !  
hes got something plastic lodged in his throat ,  weve got to go to the hospital .  
but no ,  because a doctor wont be able to help him ,  its just gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years .  
i think thats gum .  
im pretty sure its gun .  
okay ,  listen this really hurts .  lets go .  
why isnt that valet back with my porsche ?  
maybe because youve got the keys ?  
 porsche .   
this is totally your fault !  
my fault ?  !  you threatened the judge !  
well ,  you ripped the paper out of the court reporters machine !  !  
that was the only way i could get him to stop typing !  
hi !  how are the gellers ?  
dont call us that !   
the judge wouldnt let us get an annulment !  now we gotta get a divorce !  !  did a porsch throw up on you ?   
me taking care of you is no problem ,  huh ?  you guys feel safe .  right ?  okay ,  im gonna take that spit bubble as ,   &quot; yeah ,  i do !  &quot;  okay ,  after i get rid of this dirty diaper leslie ,  ill set you up with a clean one .   okay ,  im sorry .  i didnt mean to scare you .  i just have to clean that up .  okay ?  cause lets face it ,  were at monicas .   i broke it .  all right .  well ,  thats just the way that goes .   okay ,  good .   why are there only two of you ?  where is leslie ?  well ,  you cant answer .   leslie ?  where are you leslie ?  leslie ,  now would be a good time for your first words !   well ,  look at you !  hey !  you are a little bit mischievous !  my gosh !   oh ,  youre a lot mischievous !  well ,  itll dry .   okay ,  you sit with your brother and sister nowwho arent there !   monicas apartment looks like a tornado ,  a hurricane ,  a swarm of locusts ,  fire ,  brimstone ,  hail ,  and giant man - eating ,  radioactive ants have torn the place apart .  needless to say ,  its messy enough to cause monica to die of shock right away .  parents with small children know what im talking about . ] 
 hey !  
 how do you feel ?  
well ,  lets just say that krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours .  
okay ,  so i totally took care of the babies all by myself !  i fed em ,  bathed em ,  and put em to bed .  
and protected them from a tornado ?   
oh my god .  
i know ,  the babies are asleep .  
phoebe ,  what ,  what happened here ?  !  
i did it !  i took care of the babies all by myself !  
but my apartment !  
was the setting of phoebes triumph .  
but the mess !  
is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies all by herself .  
youre right ,  youre right i shouldnt freak out .  cause this is what will happen when you and i have babies !  when will that be ?  !  
 oh honey thank god youre home ,  i was getting worried .  
i picked up the divorce papers .  uh ,  ive already signed everything and i put little xs where you need to sign .  
oh ,  little xs !  great !  that makes up for everything !  
yknow ,  i - iyouve done a lot of stupid stuff too !  okay ?  
oh ,  name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one !  
okay ,  how about you flew to london to stop my wedding !  ah ,  how about you told me you loved me after i was already married !  
hey !  wait a minute !  that was different !  i did those things because i was in love with you !  
yeah !  right !   
youre right .  thats very different .  so lets ,  lets just sign the papers .  all right ?   what ?  
nothing .   
okay ,  can we just sign please ?  
uh - hmm .   
congratulations .   
okay ross ,  werewait a minute .  umm ,  i uh ,  i kinda have a little confession .  
what ?  
well ,  yknow this whole marriage thing ,  kinda my idea .  
excuse me ?  
well ,  remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married ?  
yeah ?  
and uh ,  yeah ,  i didnt really ,  i didnt want to say anything ,  but it kinda it just ,  it kinda kept coming back to me ,  and umm ,  remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes .  and uh ,  and i thought it would be funnier if we got married .  so as a ,  as a compromise we decided first to get married ,  and then  to eat a lot of grapes .  so umm ,  sorry i got us into this mess .  
so then if - ifi mean if you think about it ,  this is all  your fault .  
yeah ,  dont push it though .  
ive got to say; i know i divorce a lot of women ,  never thought i would be divorcing you .  
i know .  i always thought if you and i got married ,  it would be the one that stuck .  and it wouldnt be a secret ,  and we wouldnt have our wedding dinner at pizza hut .   
did i ,  did i even treat ?  
no ,  it was on the house ,  it was ,  it was a newlywed special .  
that may be the most depressing thing ive heard in my life .  i should probably get these to my lawyers office .  
hey ,  thanks ross ,  for taking care of all of this .  
eh ,  no problem .   
im gonna need a copy of those .  
hey !  hey !  be careful around my porsche !  
 hi joey .  
hey !  how you doin ?  
 he has the most amazing porsche under there !  
 okay !   listen ,  im gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent .  
right !  and when is that due ?  
first of the month .  
and thats every month ?  
no ,  just the months you actually want to live here .  
ahhh .  
okay ,  here is the phone bill .   
 oh my god !  !  
thats our phone number .  now look ,  i know i kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing ,  so why dont i justwhy dont i just cover you for a while ?  
no - no !  no way !  joey tribbiani does not take charity anymore .  
its not charity ,  joe 
no !  forget it !  okayi mean thanks ,  but im done taking money from you .  all right ,  i can take of myself .  now ,  whats next ?  come on .  
okay uh ,  heres the electric bill .   
this is how much we pay for electric ?  !  !  !  
uh ,  yeah .   
so is joey going to have to give up the apartment ?  
no ,  i hope not !  i tried to offer him some money ,  but he wouldnt take it .  
well ,  how much do you think he needs ?  
i figure that $1 , 500 would cover him for a few months ,  yknow ?  but i have to trick him into taking it so i wont hurt his pride .  
why dont you hire him as an actor ?  you could have him dress up and put on little skits .  whatever you want .  
well that would help the pride thing .  
 hey !  
hey !  wow !  you look great !  wanna move in with me tomorrow ?  
 okay .  
okay !   so ,  what do you girls have planned for tonight ?  
well ,  instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with rachel we thought wed go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that rachel is moving in with phoebe .  
and also ,  my birthday .  
its not your birthday .  
what a mean thing to say !  i would never tell you its not your birthday !

look ,  we do not repel women ok ?  that is completely untrue .  
oh no ,  yes we do my man .  remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the irish potato famine ?  
yeah ,  well what about you ?  you weren &apos;t you know ,  so hot in college either .  after everything he said ,  he &apos;d go  &quot; ba dum bum chessh &quot;  
yeah ,  monica doesn &apos;t like that either ,  maybe i should stop doing that .  
oh y &apos;know what ,  girls don &apos;t like it when i start talking about science .  
that &apos;s not specific to girls .  
this is great ,  this is great ,  what else ,  what else ?  
uh ,  they don &apos;t like it when you correct their grammar .  
and they don &apos;t like it when you explain why your jokes are funny .  
they don &apos;t like it when you keep asking them if they like you .  
man ,  i &apos;m so lucky i have monica .  
hey phoebe ,  can i talk to you for a second ?  
sure 
okay ,  um ,  i .  .  .  all right phoebe look ,  i just wanted to say that i &apos;m sorry .  ok ?  i handled the situation horribly and i should not have lied to you .  
so ,  what should you have done ?  
well ,  i - i should &apos;ve told you the truth .  
uh - huh ,  which is .  .  .  ?  
well ,  y &apos;know ,  the reason i didn &apos;t wanna go running with you is because um ,  well y &apos;know the way that you run is a little .  .  .  
so ?  
well ,  it &apos;s embarrassing .  people were looking at us like we were crazy .  
why do you care ?  
because they &apos;re people .  
but people that you don &apos;t know and will never see again .  
yes ,  but still .  they &apos;re people with eyes .  
well ,  i didn &apos;t get embarrassed running next to miss  .  but no ,  okay .  no ,  no ,  i can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you .  yeah ,  okay .  you &apos;re uptight .  
i - i am not uptighthey - hey - hey - oh - oh !  listen ,  i am not uptight ,  man .  
okay ,  is this lamp in the same place ?  
who cares ?  i repel women .

 i couldn &apos;t say that i was naked because she &apos;s allowed too see me naked .  
why does anyone have to be naked ?  
why is ross naked ?  
i - i had to show chandler something ?  
naked ?  
yeah - yeah i uh ,  i have a uh ,  a guy problem .

look ,  we have no time okay ?  we must focus .  we gotta get everything back into its original place .

is there something wrong ?  
all right ,  all right ,  let &apos;s just get this out in the open okay ?  you &apos;re hot .  i &apos;m lovable .  clearly there &apos;s a vibe going on between us .  but ,  we &apos;re roommates and it &apos;s a huge mistake for us to continue down this road .  
joey .  .  .  
no ,  no ,  no ,  i &apos;m telling ya .  imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay ?  so the question is ,  what do we do ?  
well ,  i don &apos;t think there is anything to do .  i mean i think you &apos;re really sweet ,  but i &apos;m just not interested in you like that .  
oh !  
no !  i mean you &apos;re a really nice guy and i &apos;m happy to be your roommate and your friend ,  i &apos;m just y &apos;know ,  i just don &apos;t feel that way about you .  
oh !  i see what happened .  it &apos;s because i was trying to repel you .  right ?  believe me ,  you &apos;d feel a lot different if i turned it on .  
i don &apos;t think so .  
oh ,  i do .   how you doin ?  
i &apos;m ok

is it okay for me to come in now ?  
uh - huh 
why is everything different ?  
bye !   
no ,  i don &apos;t see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it .   
well ,  the end table is wrong ,  the couch looks bizarre and don &apos;t even get me started on the refrigerator magnets .  
okay look ,  don &apos;t .  .  . don &apos;t be mad okay ?  but after i unpacked the boxes i wanted to do something nice for you ,  so ,  i - i - i cleaned the apartment .  so i moved everything around and then i forgot where it ,  where it went back and i &apos;m sorry ,  i &apos;m very sorry ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  i &apos;m sorry .  
it &apos;s okay .  chandler ,  are you afraid of me or something ?  
do you want me to be afraid of you ?  
of course not .  i mean gosh ,  chandler what you did ,  it &apos;s ,  it &apos;s a wonderful thing and i really appreciate it .  i know i have this weird thing where i want everything to be in the perfect place ,  but i &apos;d never expect you to worry about that .  
really ?  
of course !  
oh well you &apos;re the best .  you come here to me .  
so it said that by the year 2030 ,  there &apos;ll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain .  so theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer .  .  .

hey chandler .  come on in .  were knitting pot holders .  
ohh ,  hi ,  kim .  
hi rachel .  
yeah ,  remember that thing i told you that happened yesterday ?  well it didnt happen .  
you didnt cancel the fabric order from taiwan ?  
okay ,  two things didnt happen .  remember i told you that someone made out with ralph lauren in the copy room ?  well ,  it turns out thats not true .  
thats not true ?  
no .  
oh thats interesting ?  because i checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you ,  rachel .  
oh no ,  no ,  no .  oh god ,  you think i made out with him .  
listen to me .  if you think sleeping with ralph is going to get you my job .  you are sadly mistaken .  
i - i dont want your job .  i - i dont .  ohh this is such a mistake .  i did not make out with him .  nobody made out with him .  i did not use my keycard yesterday .  i dont even know how to use my keycard .   
hi ralph .  
and after that ,  what could i do except become a chef .  
mmm - hmm .  
and someday soon ,  i hope to open my own restaurant .  
mmm .  
you know ,  youre a really great listener .  most guys i go out with ,  they just talk and talk .  
mm - hmm .  
after a while its like ,  shut your mouth ,  you know ?  
 hmm - hmm .  
ive probably been talking too much .  why dont we talk about you a little bit ?  
mmm - unmm .  
come on .  i want to know .  
so whats really neat .  if you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan ,  your arrangement will look fresh much longer .  
oh my god ,  joey ,  that is such a great tip .  
monica ,  could you excuse us for a second ?  i need to talk to the girl with the flowers .  
okay .  oh but joey ,  come over later because im going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter .  
ohh ,  i love birds .

youre turning into a women .  
no im not .  why would you say that ?  thats just mean .  
now ive upset you ?  what did i say ?  
now ,  she thinks that i made out with him and i did it to get her job .  
but why didnt you just tell her the truth .  
i did but she doesnt think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse kenny the copy guy with ralph lauren .  
well ,  hey ,  what if kenny were the real brains behind the whole company ?  you know .  what if kenny hired that ralph lauren guy to be the pretty front man ?  huh ,  did she ever think of that ?  
you were with kenny today ,  werent you ?  
just for a second .  
ohh ,  phoebe ,  what am i going to do ?  
well ,  the only thing you can do .  sleep with ralph lauren .  
im not going to sleep with ralph lauren .  i mean ,  i could ,  but i wouldnt .  
ohh ,  sleep with kenny .  
that wouldnt help me .  
ive had a really good time tonight .

you expect me to believe .  .  hi ralph .  
oh my god .  he just gave you the coldest look i have ever seen .  its like he hates you .  then it is true .

well ,  if thats what you want .  ill just put it all in my room .  
great great and thanks for being so understanding .  i mean ,  i didnt want to make a big deal out of this ,  you know .   you could ,  uh ,  put the picture of the famous baby in my room .  i mean ,  if you want to .

sydney portier ?  hehheh .   
 i miss rachel .   no ,  my parents .  
oh !  thats great ,  they havent seen the place since i moved in !   
yeah ,  and yknow ,  if you could not mention to them that we live together ,  that would be great !   ,  i was thinking we would eat around four .   
 why cant i tell them that we live together ?  
because they dont know were dating .   do you think we should eat in the kitchen ?   
why havent you told them ?  !  
um ,  well ,  i was going to ,  i - i - i really was .  but um ,  then somewhere ,  just out of nowhere ,  i didnt .  
why havent you told them ?  !  wouldnt they be happy ?  !  
 so !  dinner in the kitchen around four !  ill see you then .   
why wouldnt they be happy ?  
well ,  um ,  because mainly ,  um ,  they dont like you .  im sorry .  
what ?  what ?  why ?  !  
maybe because you used to be aloof ,  or that youre really sarcastic ,  or that ,  yknow ,  you joke around all the time .  or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch .  
is this why they dont like me or why you dont like me ?  
look ,  i know that i shouldve told them .  i know i shouldnt care what they think .  im sorry .  
yknow ,  itll be okay .  itll be okay .  because when they come over ,  i will be all charming ,  i will make them fall in love with me ,  and then well tell em .  
you really think thatll work ?  
hey ,  i can be pretty charming ,  babe ,  i won you over ,  didnt i ?  
hey !   oh ,  good ,  ross !  youre parents like me ,  right ?   
 yes ,  of course they like you !  
well monica just told me that they dont .  
 yeah ,  they dont like you .

ok ,  i have dandruff .  theres no need to laugh and point .   
dad ,  chandler was just laughing at your joke .  
my joke wasnt funny .   
rach ,  rach ,  i just remembered .  i had a dream about mr . _geller last night .

yknow dad ,  chandler is one of rosss very best friends !  
yeah ,  ross sure is a great guy ,  yknow ive always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father .  
i always thought that too .  tell me ,  what does your father do ?   
 hes the headliner of a gay burlesque show .   
rach ,  youre killin us here ,  will ya serve the dessert already ?  those drunken dancers are waiting !  
 look at it ,  isnt it beautiful ?  
yeah ,  yeah ,  what is it ?  
its a truffle .  its got all of these layers .  first theres a layer of ladyfingers ,  then a layer of jam ,  then custard ,  which i made from scratch ,   then raspberries ,  more ladyfingers ,  then beef sauteed with peas and onions ,   then a little more custard ,  and then bananas ,  and then i just put some whipped cream on top !   
w - what was the one right before bananas ?  
the beef ?  yeah ,  that was weird to me ,  too .  but then ,  yknow ,  i thought well ,  theres mincemeat pie ,  i mean thats an english dessert ,  these people just put very strange things in their food ,  yknow .   oh !  by the way ,  can i borrow some rum from your place ?  
y - sure !  
 and while im gone dont you boys sneak a taste .   
beef in a dessert ?  !  i -  no no no ,  there is no way !   
i know ,  and only one layer of jam ?  !  what is up with that ?   
oh my god ,  the pages are stuck together !  
 chandler !  
oh my god ,  she - she made half a english trifle ,  and half a .  .  . sheperds pie !  
 oh man !  now shes gonna start all over !  were never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world !  
no ,  no ,  we will .  we just wont tell her she messed up .  
just let her serve the beef - custard thing ?  
yeah ,  itll be like a funny thanksgiving story !  
 vomiting stories are funny .  .  .   
joey ,  god ,  your apartment is like a hundred degrees !  
did - did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear ?  
no !

rachel ?

oh ,  yes .  well its very beautiful .  its cream - colored and tight  i dont mean tight ,  i mean its not too tight ,  not that i was looking at -  
whats the matter with him ?  
 i think hes stoned again .  
 what ?  
 what ?  
okay ,  i think i might know why my parents dont like you .  
you do ?  why ?  
okay ,  remember ,  we were young .  hey ,  spring break ,  sophomore year ,  i got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so i told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window .  
what ?  !  why did you do that ?  
i dont know ,  aheh ,  yours was the first name that - that popped into my head ,  im im sorry .  i - i didnt think it would matter .  
how could it not matter ?  !  
how was i supposed to know wed end up being friends after college ,  let alone you - you would be living with my sister ?  
what about all that friends forever stuff ?  
mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you  were trying to get ross stoned !  
your parents caught ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me !  
ross ,  i cant believe youd do that !  
the reason we havent told them were together is because they hate me ,  okay ?  so will you fix this ?  
okay ,  okay ,  ill tell em it wasnt chandler who got high .  now who should i say it was ?  
you !  its not like its a big deal !  you - you dont still do it or anything !  
dad ,  please dont pick your teeth out here !  alright ,  and if youre gonna put your feet up ,  why dont you sit on the -  
monica ,  leave him alone !   
 will you hurry up ?  did you not hear me before when i told you that all of janines friends are dancers ?  !  and that theyre going to be drinking alot !  ?  
 no ,  i did ,  but tell me again ,  because its so romantic .  
well youre whippin so slow !  cant you do it any faster ?  
joey !  come on !  i dont wanna make any mistakes ,  alright ?  this is the only dessert and if i screw it up everybody &apos;s gonna be like oh ,  remember that thanksgiving when rachel screwed up the trifle ?   
so why dont you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it ,  alright ?  
oh i am !   
ross ,  if you dont tell them ,  then i will !  
okay ,  fine !    
ross !  can i talk to you for a second ?  
okay ,  look ,  i think we have to tell rachel she messed up her dessert .  
what ?  !  what is with everybody ?  its thanksgiving ,  not .  .  . truth - day !  
look ,  when everyone eats that .  .  . that .  .  . banana - meat thing ,  theyre all gonna make fun of her ,  do you want that ?  
okay ,  okay ,  well just get everyone to act like they like it .  that - that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to sweet potatoe pie !   
 dude ,  theyre not objects .   
just kiddin ,  ill talk to them ,  you distract rach .   
hey rach ,  can i talk to you outside for a second ?

 youre alone .  
no ,  i - i live with phoebe .  i mean youre  alone ,  alone .  and i just - its just not the time for us .  im sorry .  
 ah well ,  cant blame a guy for trying !   
oh and  okay ,  and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it ,  i learned something in acting class ,  try uh ,  rubbing your stomach  or uh ,  or saying mmm and uh ,  oh oh !  and smiling  ,  okay ?  
yeah ,  im not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore .   
rachel ,  there you are !  come on ,  lets serve that dessert already !  
joey ,  youre gonna have to stop rushing me ,  you know what ?  you dont get any dessert .  
 really ?  
no ,  im just kidding i would never do that to you !  okay ,  everybody ,  its trifle time !  
so ,  now ,  rach ,  this is a traditional english trifle ,  isnt it ?  
it sure is .  
wow .  so then did you make it with beef or eggplant ?

i cant have any .  you know i dont eat meat .   ohhh no .   
alright ,  monica ,  i want you to have the first taste .

okay .   
op !  wait ,  you dropped a pea .   
well ?  
 mmmm !  its good !  
really ?  how good ?  
its so good ,  that i feel really selfish about being the only one whos eating it ,  that i think we should have everyone taste how good it is .  especially ross .    
 mmm .  
 yeah ,  this is so good ,  that im gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that i can enjoy the view whilst i enjoy my dessert .   
 ive gotta call my friend mary and tell her how good this is ,  from monicas room .  
 ill help you dial .   
 im gonna go into the bathroom so i can look at it in the mirror ,  as i eat it .   
okay ,  now what was that all about ?  is it - does it not taste good ?  let me try it .   
wha ?  no no !  ah !   all gone !  so good !  maybe chandler has some left .   
it tastes like feet !  
i like it .  
are you kidding ?  
whats not to like ?  custard ?  good .  jam ?  good .  meat ?  gooooood .   
 .  .  . so a bird just grabbed it ,  and then tried to fly away with it and ,  and then just dropped it on the street ?   
 yes ,  but if its any consolation ,  before the bird dropped it ,  he seemed to enjoy it .   
rachel ,  come here .   okay ,  i was just starting to take my thanksgiving nap ,  and i had another dream about jack .  
oh ,  phoebe ,  do i wanna hear this ?  
i dunno ,  lets see !  so ,  okay ,  i dreamt that we were gonna get married ,  and he left ,  becuz he had to go fight a fire .  and ,  um ,  so okay ,  i went to a night club ,  and i saw him making out with a girl .  
 oh my god ,  he dream - cheated on you !  
yeah ,  but then jacques cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me !  it was soo cool !  then ,  he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse ,  who ,  by the way ,  was totally coming on to me ,  and please ,  that is not gonna happen .   
boy ,  im glad i wore the big belt today .  
five minutes ago ,  a line like that wouldve floored me .  now nothing .  well ,  not nothing ,  i am still a woman .   
ross ?  lets go .  
oh yeah ,  about telling mom and dad ,  i was thinking about maybe writing a letter .  
alright ,  you know what ?  thats it .  youve had your chance .  
wha - what ?  
 mom !  dad !  ross smoked pot in college !  
 you are such a tattletale !  mom ,  dad ,  you remember that - that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana ?  
well i told you it was chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me .  im sorry .  
it was you ?  
and dad ,  yknow that mailman that you got fired ?  he didnt steal your playboys !  ross did !   
yeah ,  well ,  hurricane gloria didnt break the porch swing ,  monica did !    
ross hasnt worked at the museum for a year !   
monica and chandler are living together !    
ross married rachel in vegas !  and got divorced !  again !  !  !  !   
 i love jacques cousteau !  
 i wasnt supposed to put beef in the trifle !  
 i wanna gooooooo !  
 thats alot of information to get in in thirty seconds !  alright joey ,  if wanna leave ,  just leave .  rachel ,  no you werent supposed to put beef in the trifle .  it did not taste good .  phoebe ,  im sorry ,  but i think jacques cousteau is dead .   monica ,  why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me .  
and we kinda figured about the porch swing .  
ross ,  drugs ?  divorced ?  again ?  
what happened son ?  
i - i uh ,  i got tricked into all those things !  
chandler !  youve been rosss best friend all these years ,  stuck by him during the drug problems .   and now youve taken on monica as well .  well ,  i dont know what to say .  youre a wonderful human being .   
thank you !  
no !  thank you !   monica ,  and ross !  i dont know what im gonna do about the two of you !  
you guys !  it was bananas ,  cream ,  and beef !  i - i just cannot believe that you ate that so that i wouldnt feel bad !  
well actually ,  i - i didnt eat mine .  its still in the bathroom .  
no it isnt ,  i ate that .  
let me ask you ,  why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays ?  i remember when people used to use big lights .  
thats a good story ,  grandpa .   
hey 
hey 
wow ,  monicas letting other people help decorate her tree !  did someone get her drunk again or ?  
having a perfectly decorated tree is not what christmas is about .  its about being with the people that you love .  
that is nice and were done .  tada !   
i dunno what it is ,  it just doesnt quite feel like christmas to me .  
oh ,  here .   
and thats the story of the dreidle .  now ,  some people trace the christmas tree back to the egyptians ,  who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year ,  symbolising lifes triumph over death .  and that was like 4000 years ago .  
so ,  pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story .   
hey you guys .  
hey joe whats up ?  
i had to get out of the apartment .  janine is like stretching all over the place .  yknow ,  everywhere i look shes like  
i can see why thats hard to resist .  
i like her so much !  
aw ,  im sorry sweetie that she doesnt feel the same way .  
i know .  and shes so sweet .  i just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair .  
you are aware that shes not a monkey ,  right ?  
i am so over janine .  i mean ,  yeah ,  at first i thought she was hot ,  but now shes like old news !   
hey guys !

seriously ?  
well ,  you tell a lot of jokes !  
look ,  chandler ,  its my joke .  but ,  hey ,  if it makes you feel any better they dont print the name ,  so it doesnt really matter who gets credit ,  right ?  
yeah ,  i guess .  
 hey guys .  
 hey ,  joey ,  playboy printed my joke .  
no ,  its my joke ,  its mine .  you can call them ,  theyll tell you .  
its my joke .  
its my joke .  
dude ,  you have got to turn on behind the music .  the band heart is having a really tough time ,  and i think they may break up .  
lets go watch it at your place .  
nah ,  monicas watching some cooking show .  come on ,  i dont want to miss when they were skinny .  
chandler ,  chandler ,  yknow what we should do ?  you and i should go out and get some new sunglasses .

no ,  thats vh - 1 .  i gotta tell you ,  the music these kids listen to today  .   .   .  its like a lotta noise to me .  i dont know 
joey ,  why is your cable out ?  
i uh ,  oh !  because ,  uh ,  i havent really paid the bill 
if you need money ,  will you please - please just let me loan you some money ?  
no ,  chandler .  look ,  forget about it ,  okay ?  look ,  i know things have been a little tight since janine moved out .  oh ,  was she hot .  
whoa ho .  
i know !  yeah ,  but ,  look i can handle it .  all right ?  look ,  i can listen to the radio ,  huh ?  and ross gave me this great book  .  
 all right ,  you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place ?  
sure .  
 paid your phone bill ?  
 hey .  
 its only you .  
wh - wh - what are you doing ?  
we are looking at a playboy .  
oh ,  i want to look too !   .  yikes !  
so do you think that these picturesare ,  are they trying to tell a story ?  
oh ,  yeah ,  sure .  i mean ,  like in the case of this young woman ,  she has lost her clothes ,  so she rides naked on the horse ,  shes crying out ,  where are they ,  where are they ?  
well ,  shes not going to find them lying in the grass like that .   
oh ,  yeah .  aw ,  remember the days when you used to go out to the barn ,  lift up your shirt ,  and bend over ?  
you see ,  now ,  i would date this girl .  shes cute ,  shes outdoorsy ,  you know ,  and she knows how to build a fire .  i mean ,  thats got to come in handy 
okay ,  ive got a question .  if you had to pick one of us to date ,  who would it be ?  
 i dont know .  
me neither .  
rachel .  
what ?  !  
you forget how many great songs heart had .  
yeah .  
you know ,  barracuda was the first song i learned to play on the keyboard .  
so ,  you heard it ,  you repeated it ,  so that must mean you wrote it .  
oh ,  you guys ,  with this joke .  i gotta say ,  i know i cracked up ,  but im not even sure i got it .  
what ,  you didnt get it ?  the doctor is a monkey .   
and monkeys cant write out prescriptions .   
 you are not allowed to laugh at my joke .  
your joke ?  well ,  i think the hef would disagree ,  which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah - dollars .  
so ,  you stole my joke ,  and you stole my money .  
well ,  i was going to stick it in the atm ,  but now i think ill show the sexy teller that i am a published writer .  
well ,  she is going to know that you stole the joke .  
oh ,  what are you going to do ,  follow me down there ?  
yeah !  
well ,  im not going to go now anyway  .  
okay  .   
 here you go .  
ah ,  gunther ,  i cant pay for this right now because im not working ,  so ive had to cut down on some luxuries like uh ,  payin for stuff .  
well ,  if you want ,  you can work here .  
uh ,  i dont know .  ya see ,  its just ,  see i was a regular on a soap opera yknow ?  and to go from that to this ,  i just plus ,  id have to wait on all my friends .  
okay ,  but the moneys good ,  plus you get to stare at rachel as much as you want .  
what ?  !  
flexible hours .  
 she picked rachel .  i mean ,  she tried to back out of it ,  but it was obvious .  she picked rachel .  
 he took my joke ,  he took it .  
its wrong .  you know what else is wrong ?  phoebe picking rachel .  
you know who else picked rachel ?  ross ,  and you know what else ross did ?  he stole my joke .  you know what ?  im going to get a joke journal .  yknow ?  and document the date and time of every single one of my jokes .  
thats a good idea .  
yeah !  
do you know whats a bad idea ?  
picking rachel .  
thats right .   did you hear something ?  
maybe its the sound of ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts .  
its coming from the living room .   
 i finished my book .    
 hey ,  you guys .  
 oh ,  dont you guys look cute .  you guys make such a cute couple .  
monica ,  what are you doing ?  
 nothing ,  im just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day .   remember ,  when you picked rachel over me ?  that was funny .  
i guess it was kinda funny .  
 it wasnt funny at all !  why would you do that ?  why didnt you pick me ?  
fine .  the reason that i was leaning a little bit more toward rachel than you is just that youre just kinda high maintenanceokay lets go to lunch !  
that is completely untrue .  you think im high maintenance ?  okay ,  prove it .  i want you to make a list and were going to go through it point by point !  
no ,  okay ,  youre right .  youre easy - going .  youre just not as easy - going as rachel .  shes just more flexible and - and mellow .  thats all .  
 well ,  people are different .  
ya ,  you know ,  rachel shell do whatever you want .  yknow ,  you can just walk all over her .  
what ?  wait a minute .  what are you saying ,  that im a pushover ?  im not a pushover .  
oh ,  okay ,   youre not a pushover .  
oh my you think im a pushover .  well wait ,  watch this ,  you know what ?  youre not invited to lunch .  what do you think of that ?  i think thats pretty strong ,  thats what i think .  come on ,  monica ,  lets go to lunch .   
 you start working on that list .    
i cannot believe her .  
i know .  where do you wanna go eat ?  
oh ,  oh ,  i love that japanese place .  
im sick of japanese .  were not going there .  
all right ,  wherever you wanna go is cool .  
 oh ,  hey ,  gunther ,  check this out .

hey ross ,  listen ,  you want anything to drink ,  cause im heading up there .  
uh ,  yeah ,  ill take a coffee .  thanks ,  man .

joey ,  honey ,  i dont think youre supposed to go back there .  
nah ,  its okay .  right ,  gunther ?   
dont wink at me .  and put on your apron .  
okay ,  but i dont see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons .  
joey ,  do you work here ?  
no .  
hey ,  waiter .  
joey ,  whats going on .  what didnt you tell us you work here ?  
its kind of embarrassing ,  yknow .  i mean ,  i was an actor and now im a waiter .  its supposed to go in the other direction .  
so is your apron .  youre wearing it like a cape .  
i mean ,  the jobs easy and the moneys good ,  you know ?  i guess im going to be hanging out here anyway .  i might as well get paid for it ,  right ?  i just feel kind of weird serving you guys .  
come on ,  joey ,  i did it and it was fine .  
yeah ,  why would it be weird ?  hey ,  joey ,  can i get some coffee ?  
okay ,  i guess it doesnt seem that weird .  
seriously ,  i - i asked you before and you still havent gotten it .  
see ,  now its weird again .  
i think its great that you work here .  youre going to make then picks up a pen ,  glares at ross ,  and writes in his journal) .  ah ha ha ,  ,  coffeehouse .  
well ,  you know what ?  this is great .  finally ,  i have someone i can pass on my wisdom too .  let me tell you about a couple of things i learned while working at the coffeehouse .  first of all ,  the customer is always right .   a smile goes a long way .   and if anyone is ever rude to you ?  sneeze muffin .  
thanks ,  rach .  look ,  you guys are just terrific .  yknow ?  now ,  how about clearing out of here so i can get some new customers .  its all about turnover .  
joey ,  seriously ,  can i get my coffee ?  
phoebe .  we would like to talk to you for a second .  
okay .  
so ,  maybe i am a little high maintenance .  and maybe rachel is a little bit of a pushover .  but you know what we decided you are ?  
yes ,  we are very sorry to tell you this ,  but you ,  phoebe ,  are flaky .  
hah !  
that true ,  i am flaky .  
so ,  what ,  youre just ,  youre just okay with being flaky ?  
yeah ,  totally .  
well ,  then ,  im okay with being high maintenance .  
yeah ,  and i am okay with being a pushover .  
thats great .  good for you guys .  
i am not high maintenance !  
i am not a pushover !  
who said you were ?  
hey ,  gunther .  can you uh ,  can you cover for me ?  i just got an audition .  
no ,  im leaving to get my hair dyed .  
really ?  !  i like your natural color .  come on man ,  its a great part .  look ,  check it out .  im the lead guys best friend and i wait for him in this bar and save his seat .  listen - listen .  im sorry ,  that seats saved .  
thats the whole part ?  
okay ,  maybe hes not his best friend ,  but 
okay ,  ill see you in an hour .  
oh ,  man ,  i could totally get that part .  im sorry ,  that seat is taken .  
oh ,  excuse me .  
no ,  no ,  i didnt mean you .  but ,  you believed me ,  huh ?  
i believed you were saving this seat for someone .  
so ,  youd hire me ,  right ?  
for what ?  
exactly !  all right ,  everybody ,  listen up .  the coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour .  
huh ?  what ?  
its my joke .  
its my joke .  
yknow ,  i dont think were going to settle this .  
lets have monica decide .  
yeah !  
yeah !  
hey mon .  
mon ,  get out here !  
monica !   
okay ,  okay .  you have to help us decide whose joke this is .  
why do i have to decide ?  
because youre the only one that can be fair .  
yeah .  
i cant be fair .  youre my boyfriend .  
yeah ,  but im your brother .  were family .  thats the most important thing in the world .  
 dont try to sway her .   im your only chance to have a baby .  okay ,  lets go .  
well each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truthme .  
okay ,  chandler ,  you go first .  
okay ,  i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve .  
oh ,  wait ,  is he the guy i met at christmas ?  
can i finish my story ?  !  
do you want me to pick you ?  !  
see ,  i would never snap at you like that .   
continue .  
so steve said he had to go to the doctor .  and steves doctors name is doctor muppy .  so i said ,  doctor monkey ?  and that is how the whole doctor monkey thing came up .   
are you kidding ?  okay ,  look .  i - i studied evolution .  remember ,  evolution ?  monkey into man ?  plus ,  im a doctor ,  and i had a monkey .  im doctor monkey !  
im not arguing with that .  
all right ,  ive heard enough .  ive made my decision .   
you are both idiots .  the joke is not funny ,  and its offensive to women ,  and doctors ,  and monkeys !  you shouldnt be arguing over who gets credit ,  you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world !  now let it go !  the joke sucks !   
its your joke .  
hi ,  chandler .  there you are .  
hi ,  oh hi .  
hey ,  its phoebe and rachel .  um ,  why dont you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance ?   
 monica is a self - sufficient ,  together lady .   being with her has been like being on a vacation .  and what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail andgenerosity of spirit .  
wow ,  you know what ?  that is the best fake speech i think ive ever heard .  
really ?  ive heard better .  
wait ,  wait ,  he came up with that himself .  tell them ,  chandler .  
 im out of words .  should i just say the whole thing again ?  
look ,  i am not high maintenance .  i am not .  chandler !  
 youre a little high maintenance .  
ahhh !  you are on my list .  
im sorry .  youre not easy - going ,  but youre passionate ,  and thats good .  and when you get upset about the little things ,  i think that im pretty good about making you feel better about that .  and thats good too .  so ,  they can say that youre high maintenance ,  but its okay ,  because i like maintaining you .  
 i didnt even tell him to say that .   .  all right youre off my list .  
 im off the list .   
 phoebe ,  its okay that you dont want me to be your girlfriend because i have the best boyfriend .  
 yknow ,  suddenly i find you very attractive .   
hey ,  buddy boy ,  howd the audition go ?  
not good ,  no .  i didnt get the part ,  and i lost my job here ,  so 
wow !  that is a bad audition .  
how - how did you lose your job here ?  
well ,  i had the audition but gunther said i had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed .  so ,  i went anyway ,  and then he fired me .  
he left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when youve been working here two days ?  thats not ,  thats not right .  
yeah ,  what are ya gonna do ?  
joey ,  you cant let him get away with that .  ya know what ,  im not going to let him get away with that .  im going to say something to himno ,  i really shouldnt say anythingno ,  i should say something to him .   gunther ,  i want you to give joey his job back .  that is really not fair that you have to fire him 
okay .  
what ?  
he can have his job back .  
thats right ,  he can have his job back .  im glad we got that all straightened out .  there you go ,  joey ,  you got your job back .  
thats great .  thanks rach .  
yeah ,  pretty nice ,  huh ?  now whos a pushover ?  
 rach ,  youre in my seat .  
hey ,  i never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend .  
i pick you ,  phoebe .  
oh ,  yeah .  definitely you ,  pheebs .

oh ,  well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sisters mouth long enough to tell me that .  
look i - i realize if anything were to happen with me and jill then nothing could ever happen with us !  
what ?  !  
no ,  i mean ,  look i dont know if anything is going to happen with us ,  again .  ever .  but i dont want to know that it - it never could .  so i stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector .  
wow .  i ,  i dont even know what to say .  thank you .   
youre welcome .    
oh my god !  are - are you crying ?

hey ,  you guys !  guess what ?  barry and mindy are getting a divorce !  
oh my god !  
wow !  
 what is the matter with you ?  !  
no !  barry and mindy .  
oh sorry ,  i hear divorce i immediately go to ross .   who - whos barry and mindy ?  
barry was the guy that i was almost married and mindy was my best friend .  
ohh - oh ,  wasnt he cheating on you with her ?  
yeah ,  but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me .  
why did they get divorced ?  
well ,  apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else .  isnt that sad ?   god ,  could you imagine if i actually married him ?  !  i mean how different would my life be ?  
i know what you mean ,  ive always wondered how different my life would be if - if id never gotten divorced .  
which time ?  
the first time !  no seriously ,  imagine if carol hadnt realized she was a lesbian .  
 i cant .  i keep seeing it the good way .  
id bet id still be doing my kara - tay .   towards the end of our marriage i was doing a lot of kara - tay as a way of releasing the tension from yknow ,  not doing anything else physical .  
maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara - tay .  
and what if i was still fat ?   well ,  you wouldnt be dating me ,  thats for sure .  
sure i would !  
 oh yeah !  come on !  yeah right !  
what ,  you guys really think that im that shallow ?  
no ,  i just think monica was that fat .  
hey ,  imagine if i never got fired off days of our lives !   oh - hey ,  theres carol again !  
what if i had had the guts to quit my job ?  id probably be writing for the new yorker ,  getting paid to be funny .  but my jobs fun too !  i mean tomorrow ,  i - i dont have to wear a tie .  
what if i had taken that job at merrill lynch ?  
what ?  !  
merrill lynch ?  
yeah ,  i had a massage client who worked there and - and he said i had a knack for stocks .  
well why didnt you take the job ?  
because at that time you see ,  i thought everything that rhymed was true .  so i thought yknow that if id work with stocks ,  id have to live in a box ,  and only eat lox ,  and have a pet fox .  
 oh my god !  rachel green ?

chandler !  
i know you probably dont want to go out with me ,  yknow because i make too many jokes and ive never been in a serious relationship and i guess im not technically a  &quot; doctor  &quot;   
there was just one woman ,  wasnt there ?

including me ?  
hey ,  remember when i had a monkey ?  
yeah .

unagi is a state of total awareness .  okay ?  only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you !

 all im saying is ,  its one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack ,  i dont know ,  like a  surprise !  !   
all right ,  you know that one was coming ,  but that doesnt mean you have unagi .

yeah ,  take your time .   
 just - just so you know i was a freshman and she was a senior .  so it wasnt as bad as - as 
ross ,  look ,  i know ive been giving you a lot of jabs and its partly because im very protective of lizzie ,  and partly because well ,  they just keep coming to me .  but i have to admit that after all the wonderful things that lizzie has told me and the many ,  many ,   many stories that rachel has told me that ,  well  youre not  all bad .  
not all bad .  
and anyhow ,  im sorry i was so harsh before ,  but you have to understand that i  still look at lizzie like shes a twelve - year - old girl .  
yeah .  you know what ?  i know what you mean; i do that too .  
i beg your pardon ?  
no !  no !  noti dont mean i - i see her as a twelve - year - old girl !  i mean i - i have a son ,  whos umm six and i still think of him as a baby .

now wait a minute thats not fair .  he was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to emily ,  he just didnt tell me .   maybe i have to pee again .   
well ,  this is fun .  so ross ,  did you kill any of these wives ?  
yknow what ?  i - i - i i - i have had enough of this !  yknow ,  i - i - i care a great deal about your daughter and i have treated her with nothing but respect !  so if - if youve got a problem with me ,  frankly 
are you yelling at me ?  !  
god no !  
yknow what daddy ?  if you dont like ross ,  thats fine .  it doesnt matter to me ,  im gonna go out with him anyway .  
really ?  !   
well if it doesnt matter to her ,  it doesnt matter to me !   still not yelling !  
wow .  what can i say ?   this doesnt make me like you any better !  
thats okay ,  im not so crazy about myself right now either .  
then we agree ?  
uh yeah ,  i guessyeah !  i guess so .  
neither of us like ross !  
i like ross .  
ohhh !  kids !  
 wait - wait - wait ,  i just thought of another story about how nice ross is !  
thats okay rach ,  were not liking ross right now .  
well ,  it turns out you were right c . h . e . e . s . e .  
the shipment never made it through omaha ?  
 hi ,  you guys .  
hey !  
hi !  
whats the matter ?  
well its justits one of those situations that i just hate .  yknow ?  a massage client gave me three tickets to the helmet - pelts exhibit at the morgan chase museum .  
 now youre thinking you gotta sleep with him .  
no !  no !  its just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us !  
ill give up my ticket .  
me too .  
okay thats so generous !  
and i think ross is generous too .  
great !  okay then its just us girls !  
yeah .  
so what - what is the exhibit .  
its mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches .  
oh man !   
 hey !  
hi !  
hey !  
hey ross listen chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend !  
thanks ?  but i have plans; elizabeth and i are going out of town .  
oh thats great !  
yeah .  
i mean think about all the money that youre gonna make !  
why ?  what ?  
well ,  her father pays you for baby - sitting right ?  
no ,  no ,  thats funny .  but maybe its time to move on ,  let it go ,  yknow ?  stop it !  besides ,  rachel is going out with elizabeths father ,  so ah ,  hes much older than she is .  looks like im not the only one interested in fossils ,  huh ?  
i mean ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils .  
okay ,  okay .  uh ,  well uh ,  rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings  in his ear .   
ross .  
oh ,  come on you guys; thats funny !  yknow ?  because hes needhes got like a hearing aide yknow ,  cause - cause yknow ,  cause hes all old ,  and  
okay look ,  ross ,  just so you know that since lizzie likes you so much ,  ive decided to accept the fact that youre going out with her .  
really ?  that okay ,  thats great .  
yeah .  but then i changed my mind .  im funny like that .  so i told lizzie ,  now im telling you ,  i dont want you seeing my daughter anymore .  
all right look ,  i - i realize it upsets you .  
yes it does .  
but ,  elizabeth and i are - are both adults and so i dont think theres really anything you can do about it .  
ill call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired .  
oh ,  this is so exciting !  you get your picture back up on the wall of fame !  eek !  
i know .  it was so cool when i was up there before .  me and jim belushi would just be crackin up about something then i get fired off of days of our lives and he takes me down .  now hes just laughing at me .  look at him ,  that smug belushi bastard ,  ill

the little jail between the doors !  
phoebe ,  i asked you to guard the ring !  
i know ,  im sorry !  but yknow ,  this ring is better !  monica never even saw the other ring .  
yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring i got goose bumps .  
maybe it was the guy .  
hey !  so uh ,  was he excited about the tickets ?  
no !  he blew us off !  
what ?  !  
i know !  
i cant believe it .   can i tell you something ?  im a little mad at him now .  
can i tell you something ?  me too .  
yknow what ?  he didnt want to talk to us about being angry ,  well maybe we dont talk to him at all !

okay ,  hold on real quick ,  hold on a second let me just uh ,   get a little more comfortable here .  wait ,  now wait a second ,  this isnt too revealing is it ?  
 no .  what ever happened to that little dude .   so full of dreams 
i dont care about the little dude !  i cant !  i cannot listen to anymore of this !  yknow ,  the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional !  and then its only because they get paid $100 an hour !  do you know how much money i couldve made listening to you ?  $2 , 000 !  and do you know when i figured that out ?  while you were talking !  
what ?  !  i cant believe youre trying to stifle me !  when just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me !  
oh im sorry .  i i - i dont meani didnt mean to stifle you .  i this is all just a little overwhelming .  
oh rachel ,  im so sorry .  i didnt mean to overwhelm you .  its just that ,  when those gates open ,  you  hard to close em .  but they are closed now .  believe me .  
im so glad ,  im so glad you shared .   and im glad that youre done .  what do you say we umm  
 hey .  
i cant believe i let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring !  
its not a stupid gumball machine looking ring !  its a beautiful ring !  
no ,  its not !  when i looked at the other ring i could see monicas face when i gave it to her ,  yknow ?  and i could see her saying yes .  when i look at this ring ,  all i see is a ring !  unless i look at it really closely and then i can see my own eye .   look ,  this is the most important thing im gonna do in my life .  i wanna make sure its perfect .  
okay .  there may be a way that we can get the other ring back .  cause i heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose .  so maybe we can get him to trade rings or something .  
i cant do that .  
there he is !   
okay and he hasnt proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger .  
wow !  youre good !  after this ,  we should solve crimes .  
yeah !  okay ,  go ,  go ,  go get him .

wow !  i would trade .  
it is beautiful ,  but im gonna use this one .  now ,  if youll excuse me .  
no - no !  this is my fiancee  and her heart was set on that ring .  you dont want to break her heart now do you ?

oh hi !  the youth center .  
just out of curiosity ,  how - how much is that boat worth ?  
 hey ,  i was pretty close .   uhh ,  so bad news .  umm ,  i cant buy the boat ,  i dont have any money .   
joey !  joey ,  good one !

well ,  what am i gonna do rach ?  !  i dont have that kind of money !  
i know .  okay .   okay .  okay .  all right .  all right ,  this is what were gonna do ,  we are gonna go to the next highest bidder ,  and we are just gonna let them buy it ,  and then youre just gonna pay the difference .  
okay .  
okay .  
look ,  i dont know why the kids need a youth center anyway !  yknow ?  they should just watch tv after school like i did and i turned out fine !  
and so ,  were hiding in the bathroom .  
and - and then i sneak out and before monica can her parents come in .  
so i hide in the shower and the next thing you know theyre going at it right on the bathroom floor .  
 oh my god !  
i got a good one ,  i got a good one !  i once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy .   
its so great seeing you guys again .  id like to make a toast .   uh ,  as a poet once said ,   &quot; in the sweetness of friendship ,  let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed .  &quot;

thats right ,  i can throw her off .  i can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind .  
yeah !  yeah !  convince her that - that youre scared of commitment !  convince her that youre a little coward !  
i can do that ,  ive had 30 years of practice .  
hey ,  being you is finally gonna pay off !   
 i had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes !  
that guys still doing that ?  !  
 hey !   oh my god youre here ,  let me see your hand !  !

 hi guys !  
hey !  
hey !  
what are you up too ?  
oh ,  just hanging out ,  talkin about uh ,  websites .   yeah ,  we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you .  
 yeah ,  big brother .  
well thats a little crazy .  although i am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the internet .  
yeah ,  well yknow ,  it just got me thinking though ,  why would anybody ever want to get married huh ?  
why ?  !  to celebrate your relationship !  to solidify your commitment !  to declare your love for one another to the world !  
eh 
okay well thats good to know .   
hey monica ,  theres a customer who wants to complement the chef ,  should i let him in ?  
sure ,  i love this part !   
 come on in .   
hi !  
richard !  
actually ,  im not here to complement the chef .  
ohh oh ,  thats okay i hate when people come back to complement the chef .  like i have nothing better to do !  so whats up ?  
well ,  it was great seeing you the other night .  
oh ,  good to see you too .  did you come down here to tell me that ?  
what uhwhat did youwhat ?  !  
i still love you .  and i know i probably shouldnt even be here telling you this ,  i mean youre with chandler a guy i really like ,  and if you say hes straight ill believe you !  after seeing ya the other night i knew if i didnt tell ya id regret it for the rest of my life .  letting you go was the stupidest thing i ever did .  
yknow youre really not supposed to be back here !  
well yeah ,  im sorry .  i know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but i had to tell ya !  i wanna spend my life with you .  i wanna marry you .  i wanna have kids with you .  
oh god  why dont they put chairs back here ?  !  
i know this is crazy but am i too late ?  
what the yes youre too late !  where was all this three years ago ?  !  
well i know i was an idiot !  and i tried to forget you ,  i really did !  yknow after we had lunch last year i spent six months in africa trying to get you out of my head !  
what were you doing in africa ?  
working with blind kids .  
ohhh !  what are you doing to me ?  !  oh look ,  i - i im sorry but umm ,  this - this - this - this is not going to happen .  
okay thats fine ,  ill walk away .  and ill never bother you again ,  but only if you tell me chandlers willing to give you everything i am .  
well he is !  yeah ,  i mean marriage is all he talks about !  my goodness ,  in fact ,  im the one thats making him wait !  
you are ?  
yeah !  
why ?  
isnt it incredible ?  !  monica and chandler ,  gettin married .  
i know ,  theyre gonna be so happy together .  
ohh i mean two best friends falling in love ,  how often does that happen ?  
not that often !  
no !  im so happy for them !  
me too !  so happy for them !  
im so happy and not at all jealous .  
oh no !  no god ,  definitely not jealous !   
i mean im probably 98% happy ,  maybe 2% jealous .  and i mean whats 2% ?  thats nothing .  
totally .  im like 90 / 10 .  
yeah me too .   
hey uh ,  have you guys scene chandler ?  
so that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday ,  you dont really believe that do you ?  
sure i do .  in fact ,  i think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural .  i mean look at pigs .  lets take a second here and look at pigs .  okay pigs dont mate for life .  i mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime ,  and thats just an ordinary pig not even a pig thats good at sports !  
yeah ,  but thats pigs not people !  
if marriage worked ,  id be all for it .  but do you know what the divorce rate in this country is ?  97% .  
wait a minute .  are you honestly telling me that - that you may never want to get married ?  
well ,  never say never but yknow probably uh yeah ,  never .  
oh my god !  then - then - then what are we even doing ?  !  what is this ?  !  
whoa !  whoa !  whoa !  what is all this pressure ?  !  is this some new kind of strategy ?  why dont you put down your copy of the rules huh mantrap ?  !  
yknow what ?  !  i gotta go !  ugh !   
were gonna find love !  
definitely !  
yeah ,  im pretty confident about that .  thats what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for monica and chandler !  it would be nice to have a little guarantee though .  
what do you mean ?  
well yknow ,  some people make deals with a friend ,  like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40 ,  they marry each other .  
you mean a backup ?  
exactly !  
yeah ,  yeah i got that .  
you do ?  
hm - mmm .  
who ?  
joey .  
joey ?  !  
yeah !  
are you serious ?  !  
yeah ,  i locked him years ago !  
wh so if neither of you are married by the time youre 40 ,  youre gonna marry joey .  
yep ,  we shook on it .  yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal .  
oh ,  seriously ?  
ohh ,  yeah .  i think his exact words were  
charming .  
well hey ,  its just a backup .  
hey monica !

well ,  you know chandler .  
no i dont know chandler !  not anymore !  its like its like somethings changed .  
maybe you changed ?

chandler is a complex fellow ,  one who is unlikely to take a wife .  
is that some kind of boat talk ?  
i dont know !   i havent totally decided how to talk on my boat yet .

it was working until you showed up ,  you big tree !  i mean ,  this isnt fair .  you had your chance with her !  you had your chance and you blew it !  and this is my chance and i am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other !  and this is all just been one stupid mistake !   i was gonna propose tonight .

yknow what ,  i - i have to go talk to her ,  would you let me just get changed ?  
okay .  sure .

i cant believe her ,  yknow its justits so typical .  
now monica ,  i know youre upset ,  but dont forget .  there is going to be a wedding ,  you are going to throw the bouquet ,  and then theres going to be a honeymoon ,  maybe in paris .  
paris ?  
we will take a moonlit walk on the rue de la  .

yknow ,  just some good faith money to hold the date .  
pheebs ,  were not giving you a deposit for our wedding !  
oh ,  i see .   [cut to the living room ,  joey is eating a sandwich . ) 
they break your heart ,  dont they ?  
yknow ,  i dont really need their permission .  
yeah !  if you wanna sing at their wedding ,  well you sing at their wedding !  
yeah !  and if you wanna look 19 ,  then you you gotta do something about your eyes .  
what ?  !  whats wrong with my eyes .  
they give you away !  theres just - theres just too much wisdom in there .   just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes .  
and thatll get rid of my wisdom ?  
maybe just 10 minutes for you .   
oh ,  give her the deposit !  give her the ring !  i dont care !   
yes .  
monica ,  what did you mean before when you said you didnt want to talk to anyone ,  especially me ?  
what a great apology !   and you accept !  okay ,  bye - bye !  
no - no ,  seriously - seriously ,  what was the especially me part about ?  
well ,  lets just say its not the first time youve stolen my thunder .  
what ?  !  
 hey ,  heres a thought .   
monica ,  what are you talking about ?  
my sweet sixteen !  remember ,  you went to third base with my cousin charlie .  
 ahh ,  third base .  
its all everybody at the party could talk about !  
monica ,  yknow what ?  the only reason i did that was because your party was so boring !  
 we had a caricaturist !  
oh !  !  
  &quot; whenever i get married ,  guess who wont get to sing ?  somebody named geller !  and somebody else named bing !  &quot;   
monica ,  your sweet sixteen was like a million years ago .  
and yet ,  here we are doing it again .  
ugh ,  monica i dont want to steal your stupid thunder !  
oh please !  why else would you have made out with ross ?  !  
got me .   
all right ,  easy mimey ,  the moment has passed ,  it aint gonna happen !  
i just thought it would be nice if i could have just this one night !  
i swear ,  i never wanted any part of your night !  
oh ,  is that why you did it in the secret hallway where nobody ever goes ?  !  
uh ,  rachel ,  ive been thinking .  i dont think us getting together tonight is such a good idea .  im calling it off .  
 why to save your dignity my man .  
 monica ,  why ?  why would i ever want to take away from your night ?  
i dont know !  i dontmaybe youre feeling a little resentful .  maybe ah ,  maybe you thought youd get married first !  maybe you cant stand the fact that your formerly fat friend is getting married before you !  
oh wow .  thatyknow what ?  that is so unfair .  yknow what ?  now i want to steal your thunder !  come on ross ,  lets go have sex !   
 i cant believe youre gonna have sex on my engagement night !  !  
well ,  somebody should .    
look uh ,  if were gonna do this 
were not gonna do this ,  all right ?  shes just gonna think that were doin it .  
oh ,  i see ,  so everybody wins .   
who is it ?  
 its monica ,  open up !  
okay well ross !  stop it please !  wait a minute !   
oww !  
yeah ,  you like that baby ?   may we help you ?  
i just wanted to say that i hope you do have sex tonight and i hope that you guys get back together ,  but i must warn you ,  the night that you announce your engagement im going to announce that im pregnant !  
how is that ever going to happen ?  !  
all right monica ,  do you want to know why i was with ross tonight ?  !  
i know why !  
no you dont know why !  
okay !  why ?  !  
because !  because i was sad .  
what do you mean ?  
look ,  i am so so happy for you guys ,  but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that im not .  im not even close .  and i dont know ,  maybe i just wanted to make myself feel better .  and i know that thats dumb ,  but oh my god you were so depressed when ross got married that you slept with chandler !

this baby has got everything .  take yknow ,  locations for instance .   first ,  organized alphabetically ,  then geographically ,  then by square footage .

okay .  
here you go !  what do you think about centerpieces ?  
centerpieces !

phoebe ,  what are you doing ?  
im sorry ,  im with a client right now .  
phoebe !  
okay ,  lets talk outside .   
phoebe ,  you cant massage people in my apartment !  
whats the big deal ?  i did it at monica and chandlers !  
and they knew about it ?  
 okay ,  well ross ,  what is this really about ?  
look ,  this is my home and i want to be able to come and go whenever i want !  
okay ,  i will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments .  i just dont know what the big deal is !  
hey joey ,  what cha doing ?  
sweepin .  why ?  turn you on ?  
no .  
huh .  what if i was sweeping a chimney ?  
joey ,  did you eat my face cream ?   
where are you going ?  the vicar wont be home for hours .   
joey ,   where did you learn that word ?  
where do you think ,   zelda ?  
 you found my book ?  !  
yeah i did !  
joey ,  what - what are you doing going into my bedroom ?  !  
okay ,  look im sorry ,  i went in there to take a nap and i know i shouldnt have ,  but you got porn !  
hey - hey ,  yknow what ?  i dont care !  im not ashamed of my book .  theres nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a little erotica .  its just a healthy expression of female sexuality ,  which by the way ,  you will never understand .   
hello .  
hi ,  is uh phoebe here ?  
uh no - no ,  she - shes out for the night .  
ohh great .  
can i ,  can i help you with something ?  
well ,  i dont know .  are you a masseur ?  
 yes i am .  
so chandler ,  your parents mustve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged .  
oh yeah ,  i should probably call them .  
i remember when we first got engaged .  
oh ,  i dont think i ever heard that story .  
oh dad ,  really you dont need to 
 well ,  id gotten judy pregnant .  i still dont know how that happened .  
 you dont know how that happened ?  !  your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy !  
what a sweet story .  
well ,  at least youre not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade halloween party .  
what ?  !  they wanted a scary story !  
anyway ,  were really excited about our wedding plans ,  and well i guess pretty soon well be making a big withdrawal from the monica wedding fund .   what ?  
you tell her jack ,  i cant do it .  
what happened ?  you still have the monica wedding fund dont you ?  
i dont believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house !  
were sorry honey ,  but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 youd pay for it yourself .  
you bought the beach house when i was 23 !  
which means you had seven years of beach fun and you cant put a price on that sweetie .  
we really do feel bad about this though .  
we started saving again when you were dating richard and then that went to hell ,  so we redid the kitchen .  
what about when i started dating chandler ?  
well it was chandler !  we didnt think hed ever propose !  
clearly i did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal .   
i cant believe it !  that there is no money for my wedding ?  !  
we might still have some money ,  if your father didnt think it was a good idea to sell ice over the internet .  
it seemed like such a simple idea .  
stupid jack ,  the word is stupid .  
i cant believe this .  do you think that your parents could help pay for it ?  
i dont know ,  my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding .  shes saving the rest for her divorce .  and any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to  dollywood .  
well what happened at dinner ?  
my parents spent the money for our wedding !  
 my god !  what did you order ?  !  
wait ,  but theres no money !  well this is terrible !  you guys are gonna have to get married in like a ,  rec .  center !  
honey ,  its gonna be okay .  
no !  no its not !  its not gonna be okay !  it sucks !  no swing band !  no lilies !  
no ,  yknow what ?  its gonna be okay .  i mean you dont have to have this rustic italian feast .  yknow ?  and - and you dont need ,  you dont need this custom - made ,  empire - waisted ,  duchess ,  satin gown; you can wear off the rack .   
look ,  it really is gonna be okay .  the important thing is that we love each other and that were gonna get married .  
do you even understand what off the rack means ?  !  
look ,  why dont you just pay for it yourself ?  
how ?  i dont have any money .  
well ,  i have some .  
how much ?  
well ,  close to  
whoa !  !  !  are you kidding me ?  !  
well what ?  !  how - how much is it ?  !  
its enough for wedding scenario eight .  
ohh !   really ?  !  
 how great are you ,  you little saver ?  !  i mean ,  the - the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding !  
 ohh ,  you guys are so made for each other .  
well ,  youre not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding ?  
well ,  come on ,  ive been saving this money for six years and i kinda had some of it earmarked for the future ,  not just for a party .  
 wow !   hello ,  mr .  chandler .  
this is the most special day of our lives .  
no ,  i realize that honey ,  but im not gonna spend all of the money on one party .  
honey ,  umm i - i love you ,   but umm ,  if you call our wedding a party one more time ,  you may not get invited .  okay ?   listen ,  we could always earn more money ,  okay ?  but uh ,  were only gonna get married once .  
look ,  i understand ,  but i have to put my foot down .  okay ?  the answer is no .  
you - youre gonna have to put your foot down ?  
yes ,  i am !  
hey rach .  
 joey .  
hey rach ,  do you smell smoke ?  
uh - huh ,  i get it ,  smoke ,  chimney ,  chimney sweep ,  very funny ,  ha - ha .  
no - no - no ,  im serious .  you dont smell it ?  somethings on fire .  
well no ,  i dont smell anything .

 ross !  how could you do that to an old man ?  !  
 excuse me ladies .   im sorry ?  
my massage client ,  arthur ?  his daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon .  
 i gave him an extremely professional massage !  
he said you poked at him with wooden spoons .  
okay ,  so it wasnt uh ,  a traditional massage .  but i did give him acu - pressure with a pair of chopsticks .  and ,  and i gently exfoliated him with ,  with a mop .  
well ,  hes never coming back !  okay ?  you just cost me eight dollars a week !  
hey ,  yknow what ?  this is your fault !  youre the one that didnt move his - his appointment .  
oh ,  its my fault ?  !  you didnt have to massage him !  you couldve sent him away !  you couldve not rolled tonka trucks up and down his back !  
he said he liked that !  !  oh youre right ,  youre right .  im sorry .  
dude ,  what are you massaging an old man for ?  
his daughter was hot .  
hey .  
hey .  
listen umm ,  ive been thinking ,  its not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding .  i mean ,  you work ,  you work really hard for that .  
ehh .  
eh ,  you work for that .  
look ,  i thought about it too ,  and im sorry .  i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding .  
you do ?  !  
yeah ,  im putting my foot down .  yeah look ,  when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy ,  and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then ,  then thats what were gonna do .  
oh ,  youre so sweet .   oh ,  but wait ,  what about our ,  what about the future and stuff ?  
eh ,  forget about the future and stuff !  so we only have two kids ,  yknow ?  well pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college .  
you thought about that ?  
yeah .  
how many kids were we gonna have ?  
uh ,  four ,  a boy ,  twin girls and another boy .  
what else did you think about ?  
well ,  stuff like whered we live ,  yknow ?  like a small place outside the city ,  where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff .  yknow ,  we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door .  of course ,  wed have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old .  
 yknow what ?  i - i dont want a big ,  fancy wedding .

well ,  did - did you correct him ?  
no ,  i - i thought it would be more fun this way .  
this is so cool ,  maybe this is something you can do every week .  
or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans .  he does that every week too .  
oh ,  just so you know ,  you - you have to let him win .  
yeah .  
he hates to lose .

youre not a lefty ?  
does anybody know me ?  !   
whats wrong phoebe ?  
i just went to my old apartment to get you the - the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up !  
no !  !  why didnt you make a copy and - and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original ?  !  !  
 because im normal !  that was the one legacy my grandmother left me ,  and i know you wanted it as an engagement present .  
oh ,  we have to get you an engagement present ?  
dont worry about it pheebs .

cause its gross .  
no !  wait !  i think i can figure out the recipe from this cookie !  i do stuff like this at work all the time .  
really ?  !  
yeah !  i bet i can do it .   
okay ,  we owe you a present .  
 look at this clown !  just because hes got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river .   get out of the way jackass !   who names his boat coast guard anyway ?  
that is the coast guard .  
what are they doing out here ?  the coasts all the way over there .   
joey ,  just ignore the boats all right ?  were not finished with the lesson yet .  
all right .  
okay ,  im just gonna go over the basic points just one more time ,  are you ready ?  
come on rach ,  not again .  i got it !  okay ?  lets start sailing ,  and i want to go over there  where that boatload of girls is !   yo - ho - ho !  
oh ,  okay .  is that what you want to do ?  you wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old ,  hot chickas ?  okay ,  lets do that sailor joe .  quick question though ,   whats this called ?  
uh ,  boat rope .  
wrong !  how do you get the mainsail up ?  
uh ,  rub it ?  
no .  what do you do if i say we are coming about ?  
id say ,  come again .  no - no ,  wait i - i - i know this one ,  i know this one ,  uh  
times up ,  now you &apos;re dead .

yes .  
dont just say yes !  this isnt a game ,  joey ,  you can really get hurt out here .  okay ,  so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die ?  !  
all right ,  i definitely taste nutmeg .  
you do ?  
you dont ?   well ,  thats the difference between a professional and a layman .  
that and arrogance .  
 hey .  
hey !  how was sailing ?  
i dont want to talk about it .  yknow ,  you couldve at least saved me a whole cookie .   
 women are mean !  !  !   
i cant believe that !  now the only thing left of my grandmothers legacy is this crumb .   i wish you a long and happy marriage .  
 hey .  
hey !  how was it ?  
well i had a great time !  umm ,  chancy on the other hand 
i will tell the story !  it was going great .  i let him win .  we were bonding .  he even said i could call him dad .  
and what did he ask you not to call him ?  
daddy .  all right look ,  heres the story .   well ,  we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam .  i walk into the steam room and it was really steamy .   so i take off my glasses and thats when it happened .   
guys ?  
over here .   
oh my god chandler !  i cant believe it !  
i know .  
you gave my father a lap dance !  
why do they put so much steam in there ?  !  
cause otherwise theyd have to call it the room room .  
why ?  okay ?  why ?  wh - wh - why did that have to happen ?  
come on ,  its not that big a deal !  
not that big a deal ?  there there was touching of things .  
now ,  i know you wanted to bond with my dad ,  but did you really have to bond to that part ?  
listen ,  im sure that dad doesnt care .  he probably thought this was funny; hell be telling this story for years !  
i dont want him to tell this story for years .  
oh ,  but he will .  he still tells the story how monica tried to escape from fat camp .  
i wasnt escaping .  
then how did you get caught in the barbed wire ?  
i was trying to help out a squirrel .  
you were trying to eat it !   
if that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off !  
 all right ,  im off to see your dad .  
whoa - whoa ,  arent you a little over dressed ?  
 yeah ,  and - and you better make sure he tips you this time .  
look ,  i figured i would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore ,  and i figure the best way to do that is face to faceand by face i dont mean his lap .  and by face ,  i dont mean my ass .   
 hey are you getting monica and chandler an engagement present ?  
i dont know .  yknow ,  they didnt get us anything .  
thank you !  
 hey .

yeeeeeep yep - yep - yep - yep - yep .  i remember when she took me out on her dads boat she wouldnt let me help at all .  
excuse me ,  i wanted you to help ,  but you couldnt move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets .  
you have to respect the sea !   
look joey ,  im sorry if - if you thought that was mean ,  but i gotta tell ya something .  that was not mean .  okay ,  my father is mean .  he used to yell at me all the time on the boat ,  i mean it was horrible .  i was just being a good teacher .  
does a good teacher say ,   &quot; put down the beer pinhead !  ?  &quot;  
well ,  does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson ?  
six and a half !  you knocked that last one out of my hand !  remember ?  
yeah ,  i didnt want you to get hit by the boom !  
well it hit me anyway !  and it wouldve hurt a lot less if i had finished that last beer .  
all right ,  yknow what ?  i - im sorry .  i will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling .

yeah !  come on .  
awww 
yeah ,  its okay .  i know what a mainsail is .   i know ,  i know to duck when the boom comes across .  i - i know port is right .  
left .  
yknow ,  i bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that were trying to figure out her recipe .  i bet shes l - l - lookin up at us and smiling right now .  
looking up ?  
oh yeahno ,  she was really nice to me ,  but shes in hell for sure .  
well ,  ive tried everything .  i give up .  i guess im not gonna be the mom who makes the worlds best chocolate cookies .  i do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe .  kids love that right .  
aww ,  pheeb ,  come on isnt there any relative that would have the recipe ?  what about ,  what about your sister ?  
oh no - no ,  no ,  i made a promise to myself that the next time i would talk to ursula would be over my dead body .  and thats not happening til october 15th ,  2032 .  
thats the day youre gonna die ?  seedarnit ,  ive got shuffleboard that day .

wh - whats up ?

yes !  !  !  oh !  !  
hypothetically !  
still .  
if phoebe were my maid of honor 
uh - hmm .  
rachel would be phoebes ,  i would be rachels ,  that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset .  
yeah thats actually a pretty good idea .  
yeah ,  ill do that .  so who gets to be yours ?

so uh ,  what did this woman look like ?

na - uh ,  i am !  
how come you are ?  !  
because i cared enough to lie !  
hey - hey - hey - hey ,  i can help you decide who should do it !  yeah ,  we could have like uh ,  like an audition and see how youd handle maid of honor type situations .  
what are you talking about ?  
like when i want a job ,  i go to an audition and if im the best of the people they see ,  they give me the part .  
okay ,  so after this audition ,  who decides who gets it ?  
oh uh ,  me and ross can be the judges .  
 well ,  its better than us deciding .

youre lewis posin .  
who ?  
lewis posin !  he was my best friend in fifth grade ,  and - and then one day i asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no .  do you know why ?  
because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom ?  !  
no !  but because he thought i was too faaaaa  .   and every time i think about it ,  it makes me feel as bad as i did in fifth grade !  yknow ,  i - i really think that you should apologize to julie .  
what ?  are you kidding ?  that was like 16 years ago .  
no ,  i know .  but yknow what ?  it would make me feel better if lewis apologized to me .  
okay ,  all right ,  this is how its going to work .  were gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10 ,  1 being the highest .  
no ,  10 is the highest .  
why is 10 the highest ?  
because its the highest .   okay ,  rachel monica ,  the wedding is about to start when monica gets cold feet .  go !   
 i dont want to marry chandler !  
okay ,  uh 
ive got cold feet .  
its gonna be okay !  
no ,  one man for the rest of my life ?  i dont know if i can do it !  this means ill never get to sleep with joey !  
look monica ,  getting cold feet is very common .  yknow ,  its - its just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love chandler .  and also ,  i ran out on a wedding .  you dont get to keep the gifts .  
 very good !  drawing on your own experience ,  i like that !

thank you .  thank you very much .  umm ,  ive known them separately and ive known them together and - and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love .  so i would like to raise my glass  to monica and chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together .  i can think of no two people better prepared for the journey .  
wow .   good speech .  
yeah ,  it really was !  
aw ,  thanks !  
okay phoebe ,  i guess youre next  although i really dont see the point .  
yeah .  
okay ,  i cant believe that monica and chandler are getting married .  i remember talking about this today with rachel while we were showering together ,  naked .    
 julie hi !  chandler bing ,  i ,  i guess you remember me .  
hello skidmark .  
 its a nickname ,  ill explain later .  
its pretty clear .  
ah ,  uh ,  i owe you a long overdue apology .  i never should have broken up with you because you were overweight .  
thats why you broke up with me ?  
all right ,  well first of all i would like to say that you both performed very well .  okay ?  you should be proud of yourselves .  and - and i would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers .  well ,  except for racheldamnit !  
really ?  !  i won !  
what ?  !  
im sorry rach ,  it was ,  it was really close .  
well then i demand a recount !   
actually ,  it wasnt that close .  
no !  yknow what ?  no !  no !  you thing was so stupid anyway ,  this was ridiculouswere gonna flip a coin !   all right ?  !   heads !   
the coins have finally forgiven me !  
well yknow what ?  i hope monica forgives you after you throw her her vegetarian ,  voodoo ,  goddess circley shower !   
 rach ,  its gonna be okay !   you guys are the best !  
boy i tell ya ,  that judging stuff took a lot out of me .  
yeah ?  
yeah !  i was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch .   
why - why would i care about that ?  
as bad as that went ,  i actually enjoyed myself .  i think that im going to apologize for all of the stupid things i do .  
why dont you just stop doing stupid things ?  then you wouldnt have to apologize .  
i would really love it if i could do both .  
all right ,  i i have to ask .  
what ?  
are you gonna break up with me if i get fat again ?  
what ?  !  
well ,  you broke up with julie grath !  how much weight could she have gained ?  
a hundred and forty - five pounds .  
in one year ?  !  my god what did she eat ?  her - her family !  thats not the point .  
look i know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody ,  but i was 15 !  
well thats not the only time this was an issue .  you remember when umm ,  you spent thanksgiving with us ?  you called me fat .  
okay .  okay ,  now wait a minute that was totally different .  
how ?  
you were not supposed to hear that !  i said that behind you back !  
what if i have babies ,  okay ?  i mean im gonna look different .  im okay with that ,  but im not sure that you are !  
look you have to realize i dont think of you as a thin ,  beautiful woman .   see this is one of things that i can apologize for later !  look ,  what i mean is youre monica !  okay ?  and i am in love with monica .  
keep going .  
so you can balloon up or you can shrink down and i will still love you .  
even if i shrink down to two inches tall ?  
id carry you around in my pocket .  
i love you .   
hi pheebs .  
hi !  
hi !  i just want to apologize .  im really sorry i was a baby .  
thats ridiculous rachel ,  we were all babies once .   oh ,  you mean today .  
yeah .  yeah ,  and yknow you - you deserve to win .  and - and yknow i was thinking about it ,  if - if youre monicas maid of honor that means i get to be yours .  
oh yeah !  
yeah !  oh ,  umm when - when monica and chandler got engaged i started putting some stuff together ,  yknow just in case 
oh thats so sweet thanks .  
here is a book of poetry that i know monica loves .  and - and ohh god this is funny ,  look ,  this is a picture of one halloween where she dressed up as a bride .   and look ,  she made me carry her train ,  which was weird because i was wonder woman .  oh and heres a little purse that i found .   yknow i just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there .  
ohh .  
and umm ,  vintage handkerchiefs yknow cause ,  people cry at weddings .   im just gonna grab a couple of these .  
this stuff is great !  
oh ,  i forgot this was in here .  umm ,  this was the uh garter that i was saving for my wedding and i wanted it to be monicas something borrowed and its blue .   yeah 
yknow rach ,  i think that ,  i think you should be monicas maid of honor .  
you do ?  why ?  
because i think it means more to you .  
but pheebs ,  yknow you earned it .  
it &apos;s fine .  i mean ,  this is something that youve been thinking about since you were what ,  14 ?   
no ,  i was ten .  i just developed early .

oh really ?  she said she wants to go away with you ?

chandler ?  
 did she see us yet ?  did she see us ?  
janice ,  what umm ,  what are you doing here ?  
well umm ,  i thought i was going to go back to my apartment but then i just felt i couldnt really be alone tonight .   i was wondering if i could maybe stay here with you ,  just i really feel that i need to be with family .  
 our kids are gonna call her aunt janice arent they ?  
please ,  its because otherwise i really dont know what i might do .  
arent you just a tinsy bit curious ?  
 do you have any tissues ?  
yeah ,  in - in - in the bathroom .  
okay !   
well just well just let her stay .  
no - no - no - no ,  if we let her stay ,  she will stay forever !  
kinda like your barcalounger .  
is that what youre thinking about right now ?  
i never stop thinking about it .  
hey you guys ,  umm do either one of you want to get in there before i take my bath .  
janice ,  im sorry but umm ,  you cant stay here tonight .  
why not ?  
honestly ?  our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity .  now monica and i have been immunized ,  but sadly you have not .   
okay ,  im going to need a comforter ,  but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise i get very nasal .   do you have a cat ?  cause its already happening .   do you hear that ?    
oh my god !  oh my god !  you have to go !  
why ?  
because chandler still has feelings for you !  
he does ?  
say again ?  
thats right .  thats right .  and that is why you cant stay here tonight .  and probably why you shouldnt come to the wedding .  
feelings ,  such strong feelings .  
i mean ,  i realize that his feelings may never completely go away ,  but you can .  
 hey everybody !  happy thanksgiving !  
no ,  no ,  no .  no - no - no .  
what ,  are we keeping thanksgiving a secret this year ?  
no ,  we &apos;re playing this game i learned at work .  you have to name all the states in six minutes .  
what ?  that &apos;s like insanely easy !  
now ,  that &apos;s a lot harder than it sounds .  you always forget at least one ,  or in some cases .  .  .  fourteen  .  
it &apos;s a stupid game and i wasn &apos;t playing against other people ,  so technically i didn &apos;t lose .  
what ?  you forgot fourteen states ?  
nobody cares about the dakotas .    
oh ,  okay ,  time &apos;s up !  
all right ,  i got 48 .  
oh that &apos;s not bad ,  pheebs ?  
oh ,  i got tired of naming states .  so i decided to list the types of 
okay ,  so rachel &apos;s got 48 and phoebe has the lead in vegetables ,  joey ?  
say hello to the new champ of chandler &apos;s dumb states game .  
wow ,  how many have you got ?  
hey !  how is new england not a state ?  huh ?  they have a sports team !  
does south oregon have a sports - team ?   there you go .   
 how come we have one extra place setting ?  
 &apos;cause you invited your assistant .  
oh ,  right .  sorry .  but tag &apos;s not coming; his girlfriend came into town ,  so he &apos;s spending thanksgiving with her .  
oh !  why didn &apos;t you tell me ?  i made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin .  
well ,  i was going to ,  but then i figured ,  you know .  .  .  your food is so delicious and perfect ,  you can never have too many of those pumpkin things .  
now you think i wouldn &apos;t enjoy that ,  because it is so fake ,   but i still do .  
regular celery !   oh ,  i already have that .   
done !  with time - a to spare .  
oooh that may be a new world &apos;s record  
you know ,  i hate to lecture you guys ,  but it &apos;s kinda disgraceful ,  that a group of well - educated adults and joey can &apos;t name all the states .  did you ever see a map ,  or one of those round ,  colorful things called  &quot; a globe ?  &quot;  hmm ?  
uh ,  magellan ?  you got 46 states .   
what ?  that &apos;s impossible .  
46 .  wow !  who &apos;s well educated now ,  mr .  i - forgot - ten - states ?  
all right ,  i &apos;m out of oven space .  i &apos;m gonna turn on joey &apos;s .  please ,  watch him !  do not let joey eat any of the food !  
i am only one man !   okay ross ,  time is up !  
no ,  just give me another minute .  
look ross ,  if you don &apos;t know them by now ,  you will never know them ,  okay ?  that is the beauty of this game .  it makes you want to kill yourself .  
this - this is crazy !  i can do this !  all right ,  uhh ,  i bet i can get all 50 before dinner .  
okay ,  but if you can &apos;t no dinner !  
you &apos;re on !  
 all right .  don &apos;t look at my list ,  ross ,   &apos;cause there &apos;s a lot on there that you don &apos;t have .  
 hey ,  did you guys know that your oven doesn &apos;t work ?  
but the drawer full of take - out menus is okay ,  right ?  
ross ,  i &apos;m gonna use yours ,  okay ?  
pshhshhh !  
chandler ?  can you give me a hand ?   
sure ,  and joey; do not let ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment .  
don &apos;t worry ,  chandler ,  it &apos;s not a globe of the united states .   
hey you guys i &apos;m gonna go out and take a walk .  
phoebe ,  why is your bag moving ?  
oh ,  it &apos;s not !  
seriously ,  it &apos;s moving !  
what the hell is in there ?  
rosss apartment is nice !  how come we don &apos;t hang out here more often ?  
i don &apos;t know .  maybe it &apos;s because it smells a little weird .  it &apos;s like old pumpkins or something .  
that &apos;s my pie !  
which smells delicious !  
uh - oh !  uh - oh !  
what ?  
 hi geller - bing residence .  how can i help ?  
phoebe ,  why is there a dog in our apartment ?  
i &apos;m sorry ,  who &apos;s this ?  
phoebe ,  there &apos;s a dog sitting on my couch !  
tell her ,  i &apos;m allergic ,  and i will sue !  
no ,  there &apos;s no dog here ?  
yes there is !  he &apos;s black and white and shaggy and  he &apos;s sitting next to rachel and licking rachel &apos;s hand .  
oh my god !  where are you ?   
i &apos;ll be right there !  
 they &apos;re here already ?  how are they doing this ?  
 hi tag !  what are you doing here ?  
i ,  uh ,  wanted to see if your offer to spend thanksgiving with you is still good .  
well ,  sure !  come in !   well ,  what - what happened to your girlfriend ?  
we kinda broke up this morning .  
oh ,  i &apos;m sorry .  
yeah ,  so she went back to ohio .  
ohio !  !  thank you !  
huh !  where is the dog ?  !  
what dog ?  there - there &apos;s no dog here .  
yeah that dog left !  
 phoebe !  phoebe ,  open up !  
there &apos;s no dog in here .   
phoebe ,  we can hear the dog barking !  
no that &apos;s just me coughing !   oh ,  good ,  there you are !  listen ,  um ,  i have a dog in my room .  
what is it doing here ?  
well ,  i &apos;m watching it for some friends who went out of town .  wait .   hello ,  my name is clunkers .  may i please stay with you nice people ?  
oooh ,  i wish she could stay here ,  but chandler is allergic !  
extremely allergic ,  okay ?  if i &apos;m anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes ,  my throat will just close up !  
that &apos;s odd ,   &apos;cause this dog &apos;s been living here for the past 3 days 
 really ?  
chandler ,  if that dog &apos;s been here that long ,  and you haven &apos;t had a reaction ,  maybe you &apos;re not allergic to this dog ?  
well ,  it still has to go ,  right ?  
okay ,  it &apos;s um 
 don &apos;t do it !  
don &apos;t do what ?  
 i have to !  okay ?  it &apos;s time !   okay ,  i hate dogs .  
what ?  
are you crazy ?  
are you out of your mind ?  
why ?  
told ya .   
they are needy ,  they are jumpy ,  and you can &apos;t tell what they are thinking ,  and that scares me a little bit .  
right ,  they are scary .   ahh ,  she just ate a treat out of my hand !  !  !  
wait a minute .  do you not like all dogs ?  i mean ,  not even puppies ?  
 is there a puppy here ?  
you don &apos;t like puppies ?  
 okay ,  you are new !  
look ,  chandler ,  i told you ,  never tell anyone about this dog thing .  it &apos;s like ross not likin ice cream .  
you don &apos;t like ice cream ?  
it &apos;s too cold .  
okay ,  it &apos;s just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable .  
 it hurts my teeth .  
and i don &apos;t wanna say this ,  i don &apos;t want you guys to hate me ,  but uh ,  i don &apos;t think ,  i can be around that dog anymore .  okay ,  so either the dog goes ,  or i go .   oh my god !  !  
how can i not get this ?  i &apos;m a college professor; i got 1450 on my s . a . t . s .  
1250 .  
damn ,  i forgot you were here .  
all right .  we &apos;re gonna take clunkers to rosss .  we &apos;ll be back in a minute .   
oh ,  wait before you guys go ,  can i just ask you a question ?  
yeah .  
when a guy breaks up with his girlfriend ,  what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move ?  
oh ,  i &apos;d say about a month .  
really ?  i &apos;d say 3 to 4 .  
half hour .   
interesting .  
when it &apos;s your assistant ,  i would say never .  
all right ,  rach ,  the big question is ,  does he like you ?  all right ?  because if he doesn &apos;t like you ,  this is all a moo - point .  
huh .  a moo - point ?  
yeah ,  it &apos;s like a cow &apos;s opinion .  it just doesn &apos;t matter .  it &apos;s moo .  
 have i been living with him for too long ,  or did that all just make sense ?  
please ,  don &apos;t listen to joey ,  okay .  would you look at him ?  he - hes obviously depressed .  he &apos;s away from his family; he &apos;s spending thanksgiving with strangers .  what he needs right now is for you to be his friend .  
you &apos;re right ,  i &apos;m sorry .  thank you .  okay ,  that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do .  
fine !  take their advice .  no one ever listens to me .  when the package is this pretty ,  no one cares what &apos;s inside .   
hey !  
hey .  
how are you holding up ?  
not bad .  
yeah ?  i &apos;m sorry about your girlfriend .  
thanks .  
so were you guys together a long time ?  
a year .  on and off .  i kinda thought we &apos;d end up together .  i don &apos;t anymore .  
now that she broke up with you ?  
yeah .  
yeah .  hmmmm .  
it &apos;s weird .  i always used to assume ,  that i would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given .  but lately it &apos;s like what if it &apos;s not .  do you ever have that feeling ?  
no yeah ,  all the time ,  constantly .  it &apos;s terrifying .  but you know that i figure it it has to work out .  
why ?  
because ,  uhit has to .  
you have all the answers ,  don &apos;t you ?  
yeah ,  i know ,  i do .  i really do .  
hey ,  thanks for talking to me .  
well ,  what is a boss for ?  hug it out !   
 all right ,  he likes you back !  huh ?  told ya ,  you should go for it !  
what ?  
what did joey say ?  i like you back ?  
uh ,  yeah ,  well ,  see ,  he joey knows ,  that i &apos;m - i &apos;m very insecure about my back and ,  and you &apos;re hugging me ,  so obviously you are not repulsed by it ,  yeah !  
wait - wait a minute; that doesn &apos;t make any sense .  
no ?   all right ,  here &apos;s the truth um ,  joey said what he said ,  because um ,  i &apos;m attracted to you .  
wow .   
yeah ,  i admit it .  i have a crush on you ,  and uh ,  and ,  and i know that &apos;s crazy because we work together ,  and - and nothing could ever happen ,  and the last thing i want to do is - is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable .  which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now .  
 oh my god !  those guys are stealing my car !   
what ?  
right there !  that &apos;s my car !   hey !  !  
okay ,  that &apos;s gonna take them a minute .  do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest ?  
i can &apos;t believe this !   
okay phoebe ,  we should probably go back now .  
 please don &apos;t leave me ,  i &apos;ll be lonely .  
stop it .  stop !  okay let &apos;s go .  we can be strong .  
yeah ,  okay .   
oh my god !  did you hear that ?  she said monica !   oooh ,  i can &apos;t leave her !  
you know if you want ,  we can sneak the dog back in and chandler wouldn &apos;t even know .  
that &apos;s not gonna work .  
i &apos;ve had that dog there for three days and chandler had no idea .  he &apos;s not so smart .  
hey !  i didn &apos;t know either .  
yeah ,  but you kinda knew that something was going on ,  didn &apos;t you ?  
where &apos;s chandler ?  
 here i am .  
wash your hands !  !  !  
how did you know ?    
hey !  what &apos;s she doing back here ?  
relax ,  ross .  she &apos;s not made of ice cream !  
hey look ,  phoebe .  i ,  uh ,  i laid out the states geographically .  .  .  
 no ,  no ,  we don &apos;t really have time for this right now .  okay ,  we have to keep chandler away from my bedroom .  
yeah ,  but ,  but look what i &apos;m .  .  .  
see ,  this is exactly what we do not have time for .   
 where &apos;s monica ?  
um ,  in phoebe &apos;s room .  you can &apos;t go in there .  
why not ?   
monica &apos;s crying .  she &apos;s very upset about this whole clunkers thing .  
well ,  i ,  i should go in there .  
no .  no ,  no .  she doesn &apos;t want to see you right now .  
why not ?  
because you sent away the dog !  
this is ridiculous .   
oh ,  is it ?  is it ?  look ,  when monica and i were kids ,  we had a dog named rover .  and ,  uh ,  one day ,  my dad decides ,  he doesn &apos;t like dogs .  so monica and her friend phyllis take away the dog .  and that was the last time we ever saw him .  don &apos;t you see ?  this is just like that .  only with a few details changed .  
 okay ,  i &apos;m in my sweat pants .  bring on the food !   what &apos;s the matter ?  
monica &apos;s all upset ,  because i sent clunkers away .  
so ?  bring the dog back ,  you &apos;re a hero .  
yeah ,  i can be a hero ,  i could do that .  i could ,  i could do .  .  .  i ,  w - w - what if ,  what if it attacks me ?  
chandler ,  it &apos;s like a big gerbil .  
and that doesn &apos;t scare you ?   
ross ,  you need some help ?  
from you ?   yes ,  please !  
 first of all ,  utah ?  dude ,  you can &apos;t just make stuff up !  
i hate america !  when i finish this game ,  i swear i am moving .   
hey !  tag &apos;s still talking to the police .  
yeah ,  ohh !  why ,  damnit ,  why did i open my mouth ?   i have a crush on you; i am attracted to you .   gee ,  i - i know that i freaked him out 
if you said it like that ,  you probably did ,  yeah .   
 hey ,  is chandler here ?  
no ,  no he went for a walk .  
okay ,  but you cannot tell him .  .  .  but look who &apos;s back !   
 hi !  
oh no - no - no - no - no - no - no !  he went over to ross &apos; to bring the dog back here !  
oh no ,  the dog &apos;s not going to be there !  
you think ?   
hi ,  honey .  
please ,  please ,  please ,  don &apos;t be mad at me .  
what ?  why ,  why would .  .  .  
 shh ,  wait and see .  maybe we will ,  maybe we won &apos;t .  
okay ,  i went over to ross &apos; apartment to bring back clunkers .  yknow ,  for you ,  and  i left the door open and she must have gotten out and i looked everywhere ,  all over the apartment ,  including the roof ,  which fyi ross ,  one of your neighbors ,  growing weed .  i couldn &apos;t find him ,  and i am so ,  so ,  so ,  sorry .  but i do know where we could all go ease the pain .   
we have good news ,  look who &apos;s back !  
 hi !  
clunkers ?  !  oh my god !  
that &apos;s right ,  she came back all by herself .  
it &apos;s a thanksgiving miracle !  
 it is so good to see you !

hey pheebs !  
hey !   
if you wanna give joey a christmas present that disrupts the entire building ,  why not get him something a little bit more subtle ,  like a wrecking ball ,  or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway ?  
it &apos;s not just the drum noise .  every five minutes ,  joey throws his sticks in the air ,  and i have to hear ,   &quot; oh my eye !  oh god ,  my eye !  &quot;  i mean ,  it is so annoying .  
yes ,  thank you .  you see ,  this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums .  
phoebe ,  you got joey drums to annoy rachel ,  so she wouldn &apos;t wanna live there anymore ?  
joey ,  yknow that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air .  
what is rock  &apos;n &apos; roll about that ?  
 hey ,  joey ,  i got you another present .   
oh wait ,  before you tell me what it is !   okay ,  what is it ?  
it &apos;s a tarantula !   oh !  god !  rachel ,  look ,  i &apos;m sorry .  what was i thinking giving joey this big ,  gross ,  scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage ?  
what are you talking about ?  i love them !   yeah ,  i had a tarantula when i was a kid .  but it - it died ,  because my cat ate it .  and then ,  then my cat died .  but joey ,  isn &apos;t this cool ?  
is it on me ?  i feel ,  i feel like it &apos;s on me !  i got ,  hey !   
oh ,  isn &apos;t that adorable ?  joey is afraid of the tarantula .  
 ah ,  yeah ,  he &apos;s so adorable ,  god ,  he &apos;s just so much fun ,  joey is the best ,  i &apos;m glad you &apos;re having so much fun here .   
what ?  wait - wait a minute ,  what ?  phoebe ,  what &apos;s the matter ?  
our apartment is ready .  
and that makes you angry because 
because you would rather live here with joey .  
where did you get that ?  
monica and chandler said that you were having so much fun here .  and apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that .  
phoebe ?  
hm ?  
did you get all this stuff for joey to try and drive me out of the apartment ?  honey ,  if you wanted to do that ,  you might as well just gotten him a fish ,  you know how fish freaked me out !  
 fish !  
it wouldn &apos;t have mattered anyway ,  phoebe ,  you and i are ,  are gonna live together ,  we &apos;re roommates; that &apos;s the deal .  
yes ,  but i wanted you to want to live with me ,  but okay ,  if you &apos;re having so much fun over here 
oh ,  it &apos;s so much more fun with you .  
we did have fun ,  didn &apos;t we ?

that &apos;s right ,  ben .  i &apos;m santa &apos;s representative for all the southern states .  and mexico !  but ,  santa sent me here to give you these presents ,  ben .   maybe the lady will help me with these presents .   
wow !  thanks !  
you &apos;re welcome ,  ben .  merry christmas ,  ooh ,  and happy hanukkah !  
are you for hanukkah ,  too ?  because i &apos;m part - jewish .  
 you are ?  me ,  too !  
because armadillos also wandered in the desert ?  
 you wanna wander in the hall ?   ooh ,  hey ben ,  what if the holiday armadillo told you all about the festival of lights ?  
cool !  
yeah !  
come on ben .   
years and years ago there were these people called the maccabees .  .  .  
 ho ,  ho ,  ho !  merry christmas !  
santa !   
hey !   
what are you doing here ,  santa ?  
well ,  i &apos;m here to see my old buddy ben .  what are you doing here ,  weird turtle - man ?  
i &apos;m the holiday armadillo ,  your part - jewish friend .  you sent me here to give ben some presents .  remember ?  
what ?  
did you bring me any presents ,  santa ?  
you bet i did ,  ben ,  put it there !   well ,  it would have worked this time ,  if his hands weren &apos;t so damn small !   ho ,  ho ,  ho !  
okay ben ,  why don &apos;t you come open some more presents ,  and santa ,  the armadillo ,  and i have a little talk in the kitchen ?  there &apos;s a sentence ,  i never thought i &apos;d say .   
 what are you doing ?  
you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a santa costume ,  so i borrowed one from a guy at work !  
thank you ,  but ,  but you gotta leave .  
why ?  
because ,  i &apos;m finally getting him excited about hanukkah ,  and ,  and you &apos;re - youre wrecking it .  
but i didn &apos;t get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  chandler but this ,  this is really important to me .  
fine ,  i &apos;ll give the suit back .   
 hey ,  you think ,  you can keep it another night ?   
santa ?  really ?  
yes ,  is that okay ?  
did your dad ever dress up like santa ?  
no .  
then it &apos;s okay !   
okay ben ,  santa has to go .  say good - bye !  
no !  why does he have to go ?  
because ,  if santa and the holiday armadillo ?    .  .  . are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode .  merry christmas !  
no !  why can &apos;t the armadillo leave ?  i want santa !  
fine ,  i - i give up .  santa ,  santa can stay .  
well ,  i &apos;ll stay ,  but only because i wanna hear about hanukkah .  ben ,  will you sit here with santa and learn about hanukkah ?  
okay ,  santa !   
all right ,  it &apos;s time for the story of hanukkah .  years and years ago ,  there were these people called the maccabees .   
oh wow !  look at this place !  
oh ,  this is terrible .  oh ,  theyve made so many changes i cant even feel my grandmothers presence anymoreooh !  new sconces !  
 oh my god !  
what ?  
 okay ,  remember uh ,  remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms ?  
yeah ?  
and remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down ?  
yeah ?  
do you really not know where im going with this ?   it left !  its one huge room !  
oh no !   oh !  wow !  !  !  
see ?  
well ,  i guess well just have to put the wall back up .  
you cant ,  because of the new skylight !  
theres a skylight ?  !   wow !  !  
so what should we do ?  should we start looking for a new place ?  
 yknow im - im sensing that um ,  my grandmother would not be comfortable with that .  
oh yeah ?  startin to feel her again there are we ?  
a little bit ,  yeah .  
pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone ?  
you heard her too ?  !  you have the gift !  
phoebe ,  its okay .  i like living with joey .  
are you sure ?  
oh please ,  i hate packing ,  its closer to work ,  and we do have fun .  although ,  im really gonna miss living with you .  
oh me too .  
i know .   oh - oh ,  wait did you hear that - hear that ?  listen ,  im gettin something from your grandmother ,  she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give rachel the purple chair ?  
and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that shouldve just lasted just one day ,  burned for 
 eight whole days .  
thats right ,  and thats why we celebrate hanukkah today .  the end .  
awesome !  
yeah ?  
my favorite part was when superman flew all the jews out of egypt .   
the armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part !  okay ben ,  its time to light the hanukkah candles !   
 hey !  
oh .  
 wow !  it looks like the easter bunnys funeral in here .  
come on ,  come on ,  were - were - were lighting the candles !  
oh .  
oh .   
i got it !

oh ,  yknow i &apos;m not that much of a sweet tooth .  iwow .  my god ,  so creamy .  oh my god ,  this is the best cheesecake i have ever had .  where did you get this ?   
 it was at the front door .  when i got home .  somebody sent it to us .  
chandler ,  this is not addressed to you .  this is addressed to mrs .  braverman downstairs .   thief .  
ino !  i didn &apos;t read the box before i opened it .  and you can &apos;t return a box after you &apos;ve opened the box .  
why ,  why not ?  
because it &apos;s too delicious .  
chandler ,  you stole this cheesecake .  that is wrong .  
no - no - no !  it is going to be okay ,  because mrs .  braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win !  the only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate ,   mommas little bakery .   i feel terrible ,  im a horrible ,  horrible ,  horrible person .  
all right ,  i should get going ,  big day at work .  yknow im in a coma ?  today ,  they do this test on me and it turns out im not brain dead .  
so 
ah - ah - ah mr .  smartie pants ,  its just my character thats not brain dead .  hey ,  so pheebs ,  we still on for tonight ?

what are you talking about ?  
cousin frannies wedding ,  it &apos;s tomorrow night .  
you were invited ?  !  
no .  
my god ,  i cant believe this !  i mean i knew that mom and dad were invited ,  but i thought that was it !  i mean from the ages 7 to 9 frannie and i were inseparable !  
well ,  maybe since the age of 9 ,  frannies made some new friends .  
well l - look okay ,  its probably just a mistake .  let me call aunt sheryl okay ?  maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail .  
yeah ,  well you call her and tell her that yknow when we were kids her precious little frannie tried to undress me several times ,  okay ?  and if i hadnt have stopped her ,  there probably wouldnt even be a wedding to go to .  
yknow ,  she tried to undress me too .  
joseph francis tribbiani are you home yet ?  !  !  
umm ,  i think hes still out .  whats wrong ?  
well ,  ill tell you rachel karen green ,  i had plans with joey tonight and he left me this note .   
  &quot; pheebs ,  cant make it ,  got a date .  talk to you later .  big daddy .  &quot;   big daddy ?  
oh thats a nickname we were trying out .

 hey !  
oh !  heres joseph francis !  
oh - wha - ho !  what are you middle naming me for ?  !  i left you a note !  
so what ?  !  that doesnt give you the right to ditch me !  
hey ,  you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex !  
phoebe hes right ,  that is the rule .  
i dont accept this rule .  when we make plans ,  i expect you to show up .  okay ,  i cant just be a way to kill time til you meet someone better !  yknow boyfriends and girlfriends come and go ,  but this  is for life !  
wow !  im so sorry; i had no idea it would bother you this much .  
well ,  it does .  
okay ,  can i - can i make it up to you ?  huh ?  im sorry .   how about uh ,  dinner tomorrow night ?  !  ill pay for myself !  
okay ,  you wore me down .  
hey joe ,  while youre over there how about another beer for the ross - a - tron ?  
hi !  
another cheesecake came !  they delivered it to the wrong address again !  
so just bring it back downstairs ,  whats the problem ?  
i cant seem to say goodbye .  
are you serious ?  !  chandler ,  we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more ?  
well ive forgotten what it tastes like okay ?  !  
it was cheesecake .  it was fine .  it had a buttery ,  crumbly ,  graham cracker crust ,  with a very rich yet light ,  cream cheese filling  wow !  my whole mouth just filled with saliva !  
 yknow what ?  forget it !  we are just hungry !  we have not had lunch !  we are just light - headed !  so let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake .  
yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not tempted .  
good idea .  where do you want to go to lunch ?  
awww !  mel torme died .  
joey ,  that papers like a year old !  
aw !  does that mean the sam goodys sale is over ?  !  
 hey .  
hey .  
hey .  
so i finally heard back from aunt sheryl and apparently it wasnt a mistake .  ahh ,  theres - theres limited seating in the hall .  
limited seating ?  !   i am just one tiny person !  
well yeah ,  but she doesnt know that .  i mean ,  the last time she saw you - you wouldve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling .  
 limited seating !  oh ,  that is such a lame excuse !  thats not the reason shes not inviting me !  
oh whats the big deal ?  !  i wasnt even invited to the ceremony ,  just the reception .  and - and yknow what ?  if it makes you feel any better ,  joan and i will just make an appearance and then ,  and then well - well leave early as a sign of protest .  
joan ?  
yeah ,  joan tedeski my date .  shes an assistant professor in the linguistics department .  tall ,  very beautiful ,  and despite what some people say ,  not broad backed !  
wait a minute ,  you got ross gellar and guest ?  !  i wasnt invited and you got  &quot; and guest ?  !  &quot;  
uh - uh ,  excuse me ,  i do have to interrupt on rosss behalf .  i - i think the rule applies here yknow ,  since she has a chance to get on broad back 
 not broad backed !  
wait a minute ,  yknow ,  youre bringing me !  
what ?  i cant cancel on joan !  
why not ?  !  
becdid you not hear me ?  !  shes an assistant professor in the linguistics department ,  okay ?  theyre wild !  why do you want to come anyway ?  
because !  shes my cousin .  i mean ,  we grew up together !  were family yknow ?  well thats important to me .

 its still there !   
mrs .  braverman must be out .   
she could be out of town .  maybe shell be gone for months .  
by then ,  the cheesecake may have gone bad .  we dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake .  
no that could kill her .  
well ,  we dont want that .  
no ,  so were protecting her .  
but we should take it .

no .  rosita does not move .  
im sorry ,  rosita ?  as in 
as in rosita does not move .  
joey ,  its just a chair !  whats the big deal ?  
the big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and its at the perfect angle so you dont get any glare coming off of stevie .  
stevie the tv ?  
 is there a problem ?  
hey ,  yknow whats weird ?  after you guys get married ,  when you introduce me to people youre gonna have to say ,   &quot; this is my brother - in - law ross .  &quot;  not ,   &quot; my friend ross ,  &quot;   &quot; brother - in - law ross .  &quot;  thats weird isnt it ?  
couldnt i just say ,   &quot; this is ross ?  &quot;  
 sure ,  do whatever you want .   
 hey ross !  so ,  i was checking out the uh ,  real estate section 
yeah ?  
look at this .   
oh ,  it looks like mom and dads house .  oh ,  it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh ,  the window in the attic is oh my god !  !  
what ?  what happened to the window in the attic ?  !  
i cant believe mom and dad are selling the house !  
i cant believe they - they didnt even tell us !  
i cant believe i still dont know what happened to the window in the attic !   
 uh ,  hello dad !  monica and i just saw the house in the paper !   yes were surprised !   who did you leave a message with ?  
joey ,  joey i am so sorry .  
i told you not to move it !  rach ,  how would you feel if say ,  i wanted to move your mom ,  and you said dont ,  and i did it anyway and her head fell off ?  
okay ,  come onjoey ,  ill buy you a new one !  all right ?  well go down to the store right now and well - well get you a new chair .  
 shes not even cold yet !  
but dont you think rosita wouldve wanted you to move on ?  i mean yknow ,  she did always put your comfort first .  
thats true .   
 okay ?  you ready ?  
i cant believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in .  man ,  some - some strangers gonna be living in my room .  
well ,  after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you ,  its time the velvet ropes came down .  
they kept your room for a while .  
oh please !  dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after i moved out !  i gotta say ,  a tanning bed and a stack of victorias secret catalogues ,  not a gym !  
come on ,  you know they love you .  
as much as they love you ?  
i was their first born !  they thought she was barren !  its not my fault .  
 hey .  
hey .  
hey !  
ugh ,  i hate this year !  
whats wrong with this year ?  
well okay ,  its already february and ive only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world !  
that was me and ross .  
oh thats right !  
hey ,  yknow if you want to pick up some extra cash ?  some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing .  
oh thats a great idea .  youre really good on the phone .  
yeah and yeah ,  and it would probably be better than the last telephone job i had .  yknow ,  i probably wouldnt have to say spank as much .   
what ?  
so basically this is very easy .  you read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can .  
okay ,  i can do that !  oh ,  by the way ,  i love my office .  
 why dont we do a trial run .  
oh okay .  umm ,  all right .   hi ,  this is phoebe from empire office supplies ,  can i speak to your supply manager please ?  
im the supply manager .  
umm ,  okay i would like to talk to you about your toner needs .  
we dont need any toner .  
oh okay ,  well im sorry to bother you .  bye - bye .   yeah youre right ,  this is easy .  
okay ,  what was wrong with that call ?  
oh well ,  all right um ,  no offense ,  but you were kind of rude .  
theyre always going to tell you they dont need toner ,  but thats okay because whatever they say ,  you can find the answer to it here in this script .  
oh .  
so ,  i think youre ready to sell toner ,  do you have any last questions ?  
dad ?  
im here !  
 hey !  
hi .  god ,  it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work .  
dad ,  we - we cant believe youre selling the house .  
well ,  its time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling .  
 lets grab our stuff and get the hell out of here .  
im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore .  
oh ,  thats okay ,  i cant wait to see everything again !  all of the memories 
well ,  i dont know whats in the boxes down here ,  but i do know there are six or seven easy bake ovens in the attic .  
i used to love to play restaurant .  
yeah ,  not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater .  
hey ,  it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies !   
so ,  i think your boxes are over here .   
wow !  great !   wait ,  dad who - whos cigarettes are these ?  
i dont know .  they - they must be your mothers ,  but please ,  please dont ask her .  ill throw these away .

i dont know why you say that so soon .   
come on joey ,  i just bought you a new chair !  the most expensive one in the store !  hey ,  yknow what i was thinking ?  we could name her francette .  
francette ?  what is she ?  a couch ?   
poor thing .  cut down in her prime .  
joey ,  the new chair will be here in an hour .  maybe we should actually move rosita out of here .  yknow ,  start the healing process ?  
well ,  i guess youre right .  maybe ,  maybe ill take her down to the incinerator .  its gonna be so sad ,  and kinda cool .   shes healed !  
thats weird .  
no its not weird ,  its a miracle !  
its not a miracle joey !  im sure theres some explanation .  
oh there is !  if you want something enough and your heart is pure ,  wondrous things can happen !  
joey ,  i really dont 
 can you tell me how this happened ?  
well no .  
miracle !  
no ,  yknow what ?  maybe somebody came in here and fixed it !  or something !  
someone like an angel ?  
thats right joey ,  the chair angel came in and healed your chair .   
well ,  shell understand right ?  its not like i did it on purpose .  
dad ,  that wont matter to her .  look ,  all my stuff is safe and dry and all hers is - is ,  is growing new stuff !  see ,  this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her .  
oh my god ,  does she really thinks that ?  
well ,  can you blame her ?  
well i dont know ,  i - i suppose we may have favored you unconsciously ,  you were a medical marvel !  the doctor said your mother could

 i am so psyched i kept this chair for myself !

hey ,  hows hows the uh ,  miracle chair ?  
fine .  
yeah ?  wow !  yknow ,  that this thing has speakers in the headrest !

earl ,  youre not hearing me !  all im saying is that youre not alone ,  alright ?  everybody hates the people they work with !   
 hey guy !

no !  thats just the  &quot; hey guy &quot;  guy .  he says that to everybody !  hes the worst !  id like to take him with me !  
all right .  so earl ,  lets just forget about the people at the office ,  okay ?  there - theres gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for !  what about - what about your family ,  your friends ,  or maybe your girlfriend ?  
 yeah !  right !  
oh sorry ,  boyfriend !

 yeah !  yeah !   oh ,  this will make a great memory .  
 okay .  so ,  which boxes are mine ?  
well ,  these .  these are yours right here .   
okay .   oh !  a coloring book !   
yeah .  yeah ,  oh you loved that thing .  you always had it with you .  you never went anywhere without - without that coloring book .  
 really ?  wow !  it looks like i had some trouble staying inside the lines .  
nu - uh !   
 oh ,  an old glove ?  
oh ,  yeah you loved that glove !  you took it every place you went .  you never went any place without that glove .  
wow !  look at this !   i cant believe i even fit into this shirt !  oh ,  this is yours .   
oh ,  i dont know how that got in there .  
 this isnt mine .   hey ,  this isnt ,  this isnt my stuff !  ugh ,  ross !   these are your boxes !  where are my boxes ?  
umm ,  your boxes are umm 
what ?  
dad ?  
well ,  the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes .  im sorry .  
just mine ?  
im afraid so .  
so why - why wasnt rosss stuff ruined ?   and if you say the words medical marvel im going to easy bake your head !  
well ,  i used your boxes to divert water away from the porsche .  
so wait ,  rosss stuff is fine ,  but i have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water !  !  !  
there was also leaves and guk and stuff .  
i cant believe this !   
hey chandler !  
hey !  
how would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines ,  has a rolling massage ,  and speakers in the head rest ?  
yeah ,  id love to but ive tried that so many times they wont even let me in the store anymore .  
well what if i told you you can do it in my apartment ?  
 are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete ?  the chair that sit magazine called the chair of the year ?  
i just purchased the la - z - boy e - cliner 3000 .   
thats awesome !  thats great !  what made you do it ?  !  
well ,  its a long story ,  but umm i broke joeys chair 
whoa - whoa - whoa !  you broke joeys chair ?  
yeah .  
i thought i broke joeys chair !  thats why i replaced it with mine !  
ohhhhh .  thats how it got fixed !  
well ,  what did you think ,  that - that elves came in and fixed it ?  
noo !   angels .  
im gettin my chair back !   
what ?  wh - hey !   
well ,  it looks like it wasnt healed after all !  yeah !  so ,  i guess this chair is mine now !   
joey you broke my chair !  !  
your chair ?  !  
yeah ,  he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs !  
so ,  there was no miracle ?  !  
no joe ,  no miracle .  
 oh no this is devastating !  my faith is shaken .  im so glad i have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life .  
uh - huh !  nice try ,  but you dont get that chair anymore !  all right ?  that is my chair now !  you can sit on my lap !   no i take that back !  
i think i should get the chair !   
how do you figure ?  
because you  broke a chair and you  broke a chair !  the only one around here that hasnt broke a chair ,  is me !  
no - no - no !  this chairs not going anywhere .  
well ,  wheres the logic in that ?  !  
the logic is ,  that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half !  
so joey breaks my chair and i get nothing !   
thats right !  
what are you guys ?  like a gang or something ?  !   
yeah !  we are !   
 excuse me !  can you tell me where i can find earl ?  hes the supply manager around here .  
sorry ,  i dont know any earl .  
 im right here !  !  !  !  
 earl !  im phoebe .  
phoebe ?  the lady who sells toner ?  
umm ,  look it ,  you - you cant kill yourself .  
 look ,  um i really appreciate your coming down 
no - no i cant !  i cant let you do it !  
why ?  !  
because it was fate that made me call you today !  
i thought it was toner .  
no !  think about it okay ?  this isnt even my regular job !  okay ?  and my first day on the job ,  youre my first call !  and - and somebody else mightve hung up on you ,  but i wouldnt do that because i know about this stuff .  my mom killed herself .  
really ?  !  
yes .  
how ?  
im not gonna give you tips !  look dont you see that this - this this all came together so that i could stop you from doing this .  
couldnt it just be a coincidence ?  
no ,  its fate !  
it doesnt really seem like enough to be fate .  
oh .  well umm ,  okay heres a weird thing .  my mother was also a supply manager .  
im actually the office manager .  
oh my god !  so was she !  and !  get this ,  okay ?  your - your name is earl ,  right ?  her name was pearl ,  p - earl .  
well ,  was there anything else ?  !

philadelphia .  
oh my god !  so was she !  oh ,  ive got - ive got goose bumps .   
 really ?  
well ,  yknow im wearing layers and its warm .  
yeah - yeah .  
but ifno look ,  okay .  these jerks might not care about you ,  but the universe does !  and that says a lot !  
 did you hear that ?  !  i dont need you guys to care about me !  because the universe cares !  the whole universe !   i really wished theyd care just a little bit though .  
yknow ,  i dont - i dont think its you .  this is a freaky place .   hey !  guys !   oh no ,  its you .  
oh ,  this is terrible !  everything is destroyed !  look at this .   it obviously meant enough for me to save it ,  and i dont even know what it is !  ohh ,  its still soft .   what do you think this is ?  
all right .  i think it was a mouse .   
 how are you honey ?  
how do you think i am ?  !  youve wrecked all my childhood memories .  you love ross more than me .  and i just rubbed a dead mouse on my face !   
sweetheart ,  we love you just as much as ross !  now ,  im sorry about everything that happened and id probably never be able to make it up to you ,  but heres a start .   
 whats this ?

nothing .  i dont want to do anything .  
well ,  doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid ,  like ross .  
hey !  that was a practical purchase !  i needed that car for transportation !  okay ?  i - i have a child !  one of the better british sports cars ever made .  of course ,  better is a relative term .  which reminds me of a joke .  why dont the british make computers ?  because they couldnt figure out how to make them leak oil .  anyway ,  the gang is all staring at his new purchase . ] 
how hot do i look in this ,  huh ?  !  
ross ,  a sports car ?  wouldnt it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there ?  
thats not what this is about okay ?  i - i am a sports car enthusiast .  i have always been into cars .  
hey ,  whats the horsepower on this thing ?  
 i dont know ,  but - but look how shiny !

oh ,  well get in line missy .   so ,  can i have a ride stud ?  
hop in .   get ready for the smoothest ride of your life .   anyway ,  this being new york he is parallel parked on a street with the car in front of him only inches ahead of his bumper ,  likewise with the car behind him .  hes completely boxed in and cant move more than two inches .  he tries to get out several times by bumping the bumpers of both cars to no avail . )

no - no - no - no !  that was the joke !  
 no ,  i know !  i get it !  its funny !

hey !  look whos back !  its the birthday girl !  hows the birthday girl feeling ?  
well ,  i feel fine ,  but i think youre bumming out the rest of the kids .  
what ?   
okay !  yknow what ?  i realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids .  all i really needed was a plan .  see i wanna have three kids 
oh let me guess ,  and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother .  
as i was saying i should probably have the first of the three kids by the time im 35 which gives me five years .  i love this plan !  i wanna marry this plan !  
if you could do that ,  id marry the hippity - hop .  
so ,  if i wanna have my kid when im 35 ,  i dont have to get pregnant until im 34 .  which gives prada four years to start making maternity clothes !  oh wait ,  but i do want to be married for a year before i get pregnant 
really !  that long ?  !   look all you want ,  its happening !  
no ,  so i dont have to get married until im 33 !  thats three years ,  thats three whole yearsoh ,  wait a minute though .  ill need a year and a half to plan the wedding ,  and id like to know the guy for a year ,  year and a half before we get engaged which means i need to meet the guy by the time im thirty .  
which is fine !  because you just turnedtwenty - eight !  
no !  ross ,  no !  it is not fine !  eh - eh - according to my plan i should already be with the guy i wanna marry !   
 im telling you its like watching bambi learn how to walk .  
 youre drunk !  mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd !  maybe im a little drunk .   
 oh thats great !  right there !  can we get some of that over here please ?   there we go .  
 hey !  are those crab cakes ?   did i not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready ?  
 how are you feeling ?  
you are so handsome !  i wanna make love to you right here ,  right now !   
i really wish that you wouldnt .

do you think you could get through a poem ?  
 itll be a short one .  
okay ,  so ross will be doing the reading .

yeah ,  i kind of uh ,  have something else planned for you guys .  
do you mind telling us what it is ?  
sorry ,  im kinda keeping this one on the q . t .  
well ,  whatever it is ,  i hope it involves winking .   
 hey !  
hey !  
so i just talked to one of the dool writers today ,  and 
what is dool ?  
days of our lives .  anyway ,  youre not gonna believe it !  my character is coming out of his coma !  !  
oh !  !  
thats great !  
and - and - and not only that ,  im gettin a new brain !  !  
so great things are happening at work and in your personal life !  
wait ,  what do you mean youre getting a new brain ?  
oh well ,  theyre killing off one of the characters on the show ,  and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body .  
what ?  a brain transplant ?  !  
 yes ,  its a highly controversial procedure .  
its ridiculous !  
well ,  i think its ridiculous that you havent had sex in three and a half months .  
 its winter ,  they are fewer people on the street .   
who are they killing off ?  
uh cecilia monroe ,  she plays jessica lockhart .  
shes my favorite character on dool .  
nice .  
she is so good at throwing drinks in peoples faces ,  i mean i dont think ive ever seen her finish a beverage .  
and the way she slaps all the time !  
oh !  
wouldnt you love to do it just once ?  !   
dont do it .  
cecilia monroe man ,  what a great actress .  
oh ,  tell me about it .  and shes been on the show forever ,  its gonna be really hard to fill her shoes .  
yeah - yeah ,  help me out here ,  when you come out of the  &quot; brain transplant ,  &quot;  you are going to be her ?  
 rach ,  so ,  that guy there .  straight or gay ?  
 well ,  i &apos;d have to say gay .  
yeah ?  why ?  
well mainly because he &apos;s kissing that other guy .  
oh no not that guy there .  that guy right there .   
oh yeah he &apos;s too cute to be straight .  
 ohh knockers will help us figure it out .   
all right ,  straight ,  and not subtle .   
ohh ,  he left his cell phone .  
oh ,  well ,  we can hand it to gunther and he &apos;ll put it in lost and found .  
or we could use it to call china .  see how those guys are doing .  
what if ,  um ,  if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and i answer and we start talking and we fall in love .  i mean wouldn &apos;t that be a great story ?  kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age .  
yeah that does sound great .  i &apos;m going to get the phone .   
what ?  wait !  why why do you get the story ?  
i don &apos;t know .  i haven &apos;t been out on a date in so long .  
phoebe ,  you had a date three days ago .  
that wasnt a date !  that was ,  that was just friends getting together  having sex .  
okay .  okay ,  see ?  i get the phone .  
no way !  no way !  you just broke with tag a week ago .  
yeah !   and until now ,  i didnt think id love again .  
nice try .  
oh hey - hey wait !  how do we fairly decide who gets the phone ?  
i dont know .   
well umm ,  maybe we could uhh  ah - ha !  too slow !  !   
im going to keep dating him mother ,  and theres nothing you can do about it !  
what are you going to do ?  kill him ?  like you did with charles ?  !  
well ,  at least im not a murderer !   to her other shoulder so that shes the only one in the picture . ) 
cut !   
that was a great scene !  and - and - and that slap looks so real !  how do you do that ?  
oh ,  just years of experience .  
 can i get some ice here ?  !  
oh anyway ,  i just wanted to say how wonderful i think you are .  
youre not the fan whos dying are you ?  
say what ?  
im supposed to meet and hug a fan who &apos;s dying ,  but thats not supposed to be until  later !  
no .  no ,  im joey tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday .  i - im the guy in the coma !  
oh that was a real person ?  !  
an - an - anyway i - i just wanted to say that since im getting your brain when you leave the show ,  i was wondering if there was any tips you can give me 
i - i - im leaving the show ?  
 i dont know .  why ?  did you hear something ?  
who told you that ?  
oh uh ,  one of the writers .  
which one ?  was it bald or was it tall ?  
umm 
yknow what ?  it doesnt matter !  because it is not true !  
okay .  
and if it were true ,  how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that ive been playing for 20 yearsill give you a tip !   
no phoebe !  you cannot get the phone that way; thats not fair !  okay look ,  i have an idea .  why dont we ,  why dont we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial ,  and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him .  and then whoever does gets the phone .  
or ,  we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone .  
i dont think so .  
 fine all right ,  but id bet youd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet .  
 all right ,  first name on the speed dial is mom .  
ohh ,  i lost my mom to suicide .  
okay no way ,  you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin .  
did i use that already today ?  im sorry .  
yes okay .   well now see this isnt telling us anything .   joe .  carlos .  peter .  ooh !  peter luger !  t hats a steak house !  
okay ,  a meat eater .  fine ,  thats one for you .  
 oh ,  i win !  hes got barneys on his speed dial .  
so you dont know thats barneys the store !  that can be yknow his friends house ,  or a bar .  who has barneys the store on their speed dial ?  
what is that ?  
i think its the dying cat parade .  
it sounds like its coming from across the street .  
 oh my god !  
what ?  
yknow that thing that ross was gonna do at our wedding ?  !  he was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said ,   &quot; youre half scottish right ?  &quot;  
nooo !  !  
no ,  there is no way !  it can not be ross !   unbelievable !  why is your family scottish ?  !  
why is your family ross ?  !  
he cannot play at our wedding !  i mean everyone will leave !  i mean come on ,  that is just noise !  its not even a song !  
hi pheebs !

yeah !  
and do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone ?  !

you do know that i will be here when he comes over .  
oh ?  and how will you know what time to come over ?  
you just said it !  
oh .  okay ,  well i - i was kinda hoping that i would just be alone yknow to think about my mom and her suicide .  
oh phoebe !

so you like the nachos uh ?  myself im partial to 
 im 16 .  
see you in 2003 .   
 youre absolutely right they are writing me out of the show .  they dont know exactly when its going to happen ,  but apparently it &apos;s going to be very soon and thats it .  
im so sorry .  look ,  if it was up to me you would never leave the show .  
yeah ,  thanks .  
no i mean it !  i cant believe they would do this to you !  and to your fans !  i mean they are going to be devastated !  heart broken !  they love you so much !  
oh youre right .  thank you !  whats your name again ?  
joey .  
joey ,  well thank you .  that is so sweet .  oh ,  excuse me .   
 im having a conversation here !   you were saying ?  
uh yeah - ye - ye - ye - ye - yel - l - l - l - l - look the - the - the only reason that i ,  that i came up to you before was because well ,  im really nervous about - about being you .  yknow if you can help me capture the essence of the character .  yknow ?  help me keep jessica alive .  please ?  
all right joey ,  i will help you .  not because i - i owe it to this stupid show ,  but because i owe it to jessica .  
oh thats great !  oh thank you so much !  
youre so welcome .  
hey !  now ,  ive been watching some tapes ,  hows this ?    &quot; jessica lockhart will never set foot in this place again !  ever !  !  &quot;  
is that supposed to be me ?  
yeah .  
yeah but jessica doesnt have an english accent .  
well ,  i feel like a snack !  
do you want some shortbread ?  eh thats scottish like you are .  
oh no thanks .  i dont like anything from my scottish heritage .  
what ?  !  
well its just my entire family was run out of scotland by vikings .  anyway ,  lots of bad memories .   
oh well ,  it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh ,  rediscover its scottish roots .  
no !  no - no theyre not .  theyre still very angry !  but yknow chandler is also half - swedish .  you know what the swedish people are famous for ?  sitting down and being quiet .  
well yeah - yeah the scottish history is so much more 
 you can not play bagpipes at the wedding !  !  
how did you know about that ?  !  
we heard you play all the way from your apartment !  
were you the ones called the cops ?  !  
thats not really important right now .  what is important is; while we appreciate the gesture ,  we just dont feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding .  
why not ?  
because we hate them .  
come on thats not fair !  i mean you havent even heard me play !  
we have heard you play .  
so ,  the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence .  so ,  when jessica enters a room for instance ,  she owns everything and every person in that room .   you try .  
okay !   all right !  
no ,  he already knows that he owns everything in the room !  hes not finding it out for the first time !  so ,  try it again .  
okay .  okay .   
right .  hes not angry at the room either .  try it again ,  he owns it !  he owns the room .  it is his .  he owns ,  owns ,  owns ,  owns the room !  he owns it !  !   all right ,  its a little weird ,  but its getting better .   oh well ,  im gonna miss this woman so much .  i dont know what im going to do !  i mean ,  its been 20 years of my life .  
oh wellhey - hey !  maybe ,  maybe uh ,  maybe this is a good thing .  yknow ?  itll - itll give you a chance to shake things up ,  play different characters .  youre so talented .  
i am .  i am ,  but i dont know ,  you know .  an actor of a certain age is not that easy .  
hey thats not true !  look at uh ,  look at angela lansbangelina jolie !  
i probably shouldve just left years ago when the offers were pouring in ,  but yknow i just got so comfy here !  and ohh ,  i turned down some amazing work !  
like - like what ?  
well ,  lets just say if i left 15 years ago ,  the landscape of mexican cinema would be very different today !  
 wow !  
but well now ,  nows a different time for me .   
oh hey come on ,  dont - dont - dont do this !  umm ,  look let - let me tell you something ,  okay ?  now when i watch you do a scene ,  im thinking ,   &quot; boy ,  she - she is a great actress !  &quot;   uh but - but ,  i am also thinking ,   &quot; she is hot !  &quot;

so they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes .

doesnt it ever just freak you out that - that youre never gonna be with anybody new again ?

i know youre planning my surprise bridal shower .  
 well okaywell dont ruin it !  just play along at least !  
okay .  sorry .   
hey !  what did you decide to do about the movie ?  
i dont know !  its not like its porn !  this is a serious ,  legitimate movie .  yknow ?  and the nudity is really important to the story .  
thats what you say about porn .  
youre right .  maybe i shouldnt even go on the call back .  
no !  no you should !  a lot of major actors do nude scenes !  i mean ,  the chance to star in a movie ?  come on !  
well thats true .  and i am only naked in one scene .  plus it sounds really great .  my characters catholic and he falls in love with this jewish girl .  who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm .  so we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other .  its really sweet and - and tender .  
well ,  when can we have this shower ?  
she has got so much going on we - we have only two options .  we have friday 
well thats only two days away .  what is the other option ?  
yesterday !  
well if we make it yesterday ,  woo - hoo !  were done !  
oh my god ,  phoebe ,  this is impossible !  we cant do this by friday !  we have to find a place .  we have to invite people !  we have to get food !  theres just too much to do !  its impossible !  we cant do it !  we cannot do it !  we cannot do it !  
rachel ,  calm down !  
 okay .  im sorry .  youre right ,  youre right .  
 just calm down woman !  
phoebe ,  i already ,  i already did .  
oh okay .  all right ,  then i need to calm down a little .  
okay .  okay .   i think we can do this if we just get organized .  all right ?  we have two days to plan this party .  we just need to make fast decisions !  okay ?  all right ,  where are we gonna have it ?  
uh ,  here .  what time ?  
4 oclock .  food ?  
finger sandwiches and tea .  
ooh great !  very monica .  
and chili !  
ah you went one too far .  uh ,  flowers or balloons ?  
both !  
were paying for this yknow .  
neither .  
okay .  umm ,  what should we do for the theme ?  
lusts of the flesh .  
 what ?  
hey !  
hey !  
yknow im - im really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding .  
oh boy ,  me too !  
yknow i was thinking if we had a a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours 
yeah ?  
technically we could have sex again .  what do you think ,  bossy and domineering ?  !  
the wedding is off ,  sloppy and immature !  
thats me !  come on !  
okay .   but wait ,  we cant .  my cousin cassie is in the guest room ,  were supposed to have lunch .  
well ,  get rid of her ,  obsessive and shrill .  
shrill ?  !  the wedding is back on !   
i thought i heard voices .  you must be chandler .  
 hi !  nice to meet you !  
nice to meet you too .  
so ,  are you ready to go ?  
yeah .   
 chandler !  
 cassie needs to stay at your place .  
whatwhy ?  
because purvy perverson over here cant stop staring at her .  
what ?  !  chandler ,  shes our cousin !  
i was not staring at her .  okay ?  i was just listening intently .  its called being a good conversationalist .  watch .   say something .  
you were staring about eight inches south of there .  
fine ,  she can stay at my place .  by the way ,  what - what does cassie even look like now .  
she looks exactly like aunt marilyn .  
umm ,  so this aunt marilyn is - is - is - is she coming to the wedding ?  
hey ,  im back !  
uh so ,  will - will i be reading the same scene again ?  come down here today .  
oh great !  yknow i wouldve been perfect for this part ,  but whatever !  yknow ,  thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie !  good day !   director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it .  
and scene !  huh ?  wasnt that fun ?  we did a little improv there .  yeah !  okay !  so you - you - you - you were saying ?  part and wants to meet you tomorrow .  
wow !  sure !  thats great !  
yeah !  yeah sure ,  just so long as its handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold .  its really important to the_director that everything in this movie is authentic .  yeah ,  and so in your love scene with sarah she talks about how shes never seen a naked man who wasnt jewish .  so  
so what ?  that part be authentically ,  anatomically not jewish .  do you know what im saying ?  
yes !  
no .  what ?  be 
so to get this part you cant be ?  
nope .  
but you are ?  
yep .  
but you told them you werent ?  
thats right .  
wow !  wow !  and its definitely all gone ?  theres nothing there to work with ?   what were you thinking ?  
i dont know !  i really want this part !  and they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes .  like if - if they want you to ride a horse ,  you tell em you can !  and just figure out how to do it later .  
joey !  this is not like learning to ride a horse !  this is like learning to grow a turtleneck !  
i kn - i know !  i know !  okay ?  and apparently tomorrow when i go in to meet the_director i have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like .  
oh my god ,  what are you gonna do ?  !  
i just have to call my agent and tell her i cant do the part .   
unless !  
unless what ?  
well ,  this may sound crazy ,  but there maybe something we could fashion .  
like what ?  
hey !  ive got a great idea for party favors for the shower .  okay ,  we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyones names in them and inside is everyones individual birth stone .  
okay .  okay .  all right ,  you take care of that .  and meanwhile ,  the party is tomorrow and we still dont have a guest list .  
okay .  okay !  well okay ,  who do we know thats coming ?  me .  are you ?

 dude !  
 i have never known love like this .

dude !  how - how did you write this ?  
i stole monicas and changed the name .  
you cant do that !  
hey !  
hey !  
hey uh mon ,  i saw the porsche parked out front ,  can i get the keys ?  thought id take that bad boy out for a little spin .  
wait a minute !   you let ross drive the porsche and when i ask you ,  you say youre the only one whos allowed to drive it .  
yeah ,  well hes my brother !  and plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it .  
its a car monica !  not a rocket ship !  
whatever ross !  just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after youre done .  
 hey !  
hey !  
hey !  
saw the porsche out there mon ,  lookin good .  when do i get to take that baby out again ?  
 you let joey drive it ?  !  
ive never driven it !  okay ?  not once !  okay once .  okay ,  i drive it all the time .  
nice work everybody !  so much for the yknow ,   &quot; you can drive it ,  but dont tell rachel &quot;  plan !  
wow !  i cant believe you lied to me .  
okay ,  i can fix this !  okay monica ,  rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding .   
great !  well rachel ,  the reason why i wont let you drive the porsche is because youre a terrible driver .  there !  that wasnt about the wedding .  
look rach if - if you want to go for a ride in the porsche ill be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block .  
whew !  that was a brisk ride !  
take the top down did ya ?  
only way to fly .   
come on ross give me the keys !  monica does not know what shes talking about !  i am an excellent driver !  
youre fast and irresponsible .  that adds up to a bad driver .  
well in high school ,  that added up to head cheerleader .   
did you see the look that girl just gave me ?  huh ?  she mustve seen me cruising in the bad boy .  
i think shes checking out your beehive ross .  
what ?  !   give - give me a brush .  
gimme the keys !  
no way !  
well no brush !  
fine !  yknow what ?  it doesnt matter ,  because ,  if i remember correctly ,  there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom .   
chandler ,  we still havent gotten an rsvp from your dad .  
oh !  right .  umm ,  maybe thats because i didnt send him an invitation .  
chandler !  hes your father; he should be at the wedding .  
i dont even know the man .  okay ?  were not that close .  i havent seen him in years .  
well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked ?  !  
well he doesnt have to know !  its not like we run in the same circles .  i hang out with you guys ,  and he stars in a drag show in vegas .  
ooh ,  i think i wanna trade circles .  
trust me ,  you dont want him there either .  okay ?  nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back - less dress .  
so what !  as long as hes not wearing a white dress and a veil i dont care .  
ahhh !   ooh ,  nice !   
my god !  
what do you think youre doing ?  !  
just washing the windshield .   
there is no way i am letting you drive this car !  so why dont you just hand over the keys ?  
oh .  of the steering wheel .  does anyone know why that is ?  its a tradition left over from porsches racing history .  the worlds greatest endurance race is the 24 hours of lemans .  which is in france and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on sunday .  in the 60s lemans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track .  at the start of the race ,  the drivers would run across the track ,  get in the car ,  buckle up ,  start the car ,  and drive off .  porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took .  since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel ,  that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat - belts ,  put the car in gear and start it .  the drivers left hand did nothing .  porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24 - hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat - belts with his right hand .  thats why every porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel . } 
no ah - ah - ah !  do not start this car !   okay !  okay !  i will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now !   
look ross ,  if youre so freaked out ,  just get in the car !  
with you ?  !  yeah right !  
all right .   
 okay !  okay !  okay !   
what are you doing ?  !  get in the front !  
in the death seat ?  !  !  
hey guys !  
hey !

no - no all kids are embarrassed by their parents ,  youd have to come up with a whole new word for what i went through .  when i was in high school ,  he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different hollywood starlet .  yknow its hard enough to be fourteen .  youre skinny .  youre wearing speedosthat your mom promised that you would grow into !  and you look up into the stands and theres your dad cheering you on dressed as carmen miranda .  he was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack !  
hey ,  the point is that he was at every one of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on !  okay ?  thats a ,  thats a pretty great dad .  
he had sex with mr .  garibaldi !  
whos mr .  garibaldi ?  
does it matter ?  !  
chandler ,  youre not fourteen anymore .  okay ?  maybe its time that you let that stuff go .  if your fathers not at your wedding youre gonna regret it for the rest of your life .  
yeah o - okay ,  but im just doing this for you .  
yes !  
so i really never get to win anymore ?  
pheebs !  
hey !  
listen ,  you know how uh ,  when youre wearing pants and you lean forward i check out your underwear ?  
yeah !  
well ,  when jake did it i saw that he was wearing womens underwear !  
i know .  they were mine .  
oh .   no !  no wait ,  thats weird !  
no ,  its not !  we were just goofing around and i dared him to try them on .  
thats weird !  
im wearing his briefs right now .  
thats kinda hot .  
i think so too .  and that little flap ?  great for holding my lipstick .  
yeah ,  i wouldnt know about that .  
and !  yknow what jake says ?  that womens underwear is actually more comfortable .  and he loves the way the silk feels against his skin .  
yeah well next thing you know ,  hell be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture !  
there is nothing wrong with jake !  okay ?  he is all man !  im thinking even more than you .  
oh yeah ,  he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys .  
im just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in womens underwear !  i dont think you could ever do that .  
hey !  i am secure with my masculinity .  
okay ,  whatever .  
god .  i forgot how much i love driving .  i have got to get my license renewed .

 he took off ?  
go on !  go on .   
chandler ,  for so long i i wondered if i would ever find my prince ,  my soul mate .  then three years ago ,  at another wedding i turned to a friend for comfort .  and instead ,  i found everything that id ever been looking for my whole life .  and now here we are with our future before us and i only want to spend it with you ,  my prince ,  my soul mate ,  my friend .  unless you dont want to .  you go !  
chandler ?   
 no ,  thats okay .   monica i thought this was going to be the most difficult thing i ever had to do .  but when i saw you walking down that aisle i realized how simple it was .  i love you .  any surprises that come our way ,  its okay ,  because i will always love you .  you are the person i was meant to spend the rest of my life with .  you wanna know if im sure ?   
you may not kiss the bride .  so ,  i guess by the powers vested in me by the state of new york and the internet guys ,  i now pronounce you husband and wife .  oh wait !  do you take each other ?

our baby .  
we have a baby ?  
phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash .  
i didnt take a pregnancy test .  
then who did ?   
oh and theyre gonna have a baby .  
its a tradition here on friends after every taping for me to hang out with you guys ,   talk down the episode umm the point of this it looks like a smooth running machine ,  but behind the scenes theres deceit ,  mistrust ,  and hate .  and i thought ,  i thought wed actually take a look at uh ,  yknow some of these moments where you guys arethere are mistakes .  you make mistakes .  
once and a while .  
from time to time .  
for example ,  i dont have to memorize lines .  you guys actually have to remember what to say and you probably forget from time to time .  yes ?  
our energy just comes way up when theres an audience here ,  and when that happens ,  something happens between your brain and your mouth sometimes and it just doesnt ,  it just doesnt work .   
uh ,  oh - oh ,  umm no you didnt .  i did .  
oh uh - uh ,  no - no - no - no - uh - uh .    
so ,  we realize thatoh no  im telling it !  im telling it   
ha - ha .  lookcome on ,  i dont know what to do or say .    
ha - ha ,  very funny .  i dont know what to do !  yknow ?  holy crud !   
ha - ha - ha ,  very funny .  look ,  i dont know what to do !   
it is one of those days !   
xcusa seniora ,  voulez - bere quakayuck it !  
wow pheebs ,  you - you speak gutter ?   
you still get nervous everybody just before a show ?  
absolutely .  
everybody .  
its amazing ,  like all week long weve - weve been saying the same lines and then the audience is here and we will mess up ,  and if you mess up once then youll get nervous because youllyou know youll probably mess up again .   
action !  
 when you were little you slept through - through the grand canyon .  
watch again that hand .  
thisll be five / ten takes .  
okay .  
okay .  you know its gonna happen .  
once again ,  and action !  
 when - when you were little you slept through the grand canyon .   
oh !  okay !  im gonna try it without the coffee cup cause i think its the left hand thats messing me up .   
when you were little you slept through the grandoh fffff  .   
sorry ,  lets go back !  cause youve got more to say .  
do i ?  absolutely .  absolutely .  yeah ,  thats your fault .  i say .   
i love you .  
i love you !    
but there must be ,  there mustare a lot of moments over the years where youre just trying to do your job ,  something goes wrong .   
hey and ,  this is a little extra something for yknow ,  always being there for me .   
hey joey !  the camera hit our wall !  
what ?  !   
ahh !  shit that hurt !  
are you okay ?     
hey rach !    
oh yeah ?  then how come i keep  
it was so wild !  we told em we were the gundersons in 16  
 i spit on her !   
 operation .  you had a fun one .  
oh yeah !  
with operation .  
it was a little game .  yeah ,  with an electric buzzer .   
oh - ooh ,  and i brought operation ,  but umm i lost the umm  its making a noise .   
but le blanc really doesnt mess up much .  
you dont verbally mess up ,  but sometimes physically ?  you mess up .  
i have had some clumsy moments ,  i guess you can call em .    
he fell down once !  and we re - did it and we went back .  and hehe was afraid he was gonna fall down 
you could actually see him trying not to fall down .   
pheebs !   check it out !    
this particular time when he continued to fall or yknow ,  try not to fall ,  i was in the room with matthew and matthew was like ,   &quot; should i do it ?  &quot;   
pheebs !  check it out !  check it out !  check it out !  check it out !   
ooh ,  soap opera digest !    
matthew ,  you have a reputation with the rest of the cast that sometimes you like to ,  you like to fool around a bit .  i mean like if somethings naturally going wrong you like to get in there and juice it a little bit .  true or false ?  
i dont necessarily like to juice things 
he said true or false !   
oh !  ooh - ooh !  
what are you doing ?  !  
youre still a tiny bit on fire there .  
oh geez !  okay !  thanks !    
it was great seeing you the other night .  
well ,  it was good to see you too .  did you come down here to tell me that ?  
noo !  i came down here to tell you something else .  i came here to tell you i still love you .   
what the fuck are you doing ?  !   
now you guys work with animals a lot .  you had to work early on with a monkey 
that damn monkey .  
that damn monkey .  
okay .  okay ,  see now the one with the feather boa ?  thats dr .  francis .  she used to be a man .  oh look !  there okay .  katie ,  come here katie .   very good .   
lisas laugh though so infectious .  its one of those things just forget about it .  once it starts ,  its all gone .   
no yknow ,  i dont want to switch !  come on !  i can throw wet paper towels here !  
well at monicas you can eat 
okay ,  shh yeah .  cause its not silly .  
here we go .  
okay .  
and action !  
no - no ph - ph - ph - ph   
 ready ?  
yeah .    
and then it just builds on itself and theres no doing the scene after .  i mean you probably wait and really get it together and do it .  
for me ,  i have a hard time with le blanc in particular .  when - wheni mean when 
 you bastard .  
yeah ,  what did i do ?  
i keep a straight face he - he delivers like this look ,  a reaction to you ,  or a certain take ,  i - ii mean i find it so funny .   
mornin 
mornin   
i mean what kind of an actor ,  what kind of an actor cant even say ,   &quot; hmm ,  noodle soup ?  &quot;   
thats a good one ?   
now ,  we should go back and take the other line .  
okay ,  ill just put a little more booze on there .   
i think ,  subconsciously 
 nope ,  you lost me .   
no !  come on !   
okay ,  the next situation is for rachel .  the wedding is about to start ,  you walk into the back room and you find monica taking a nap with ross .   ill be monica .  go !   
 no !  no !  no !    
well be right back with more friends ,  less me .   
im doing my brother .  
thats gross .  commercial break  
you uh ,  youve worked withthey always say a performer should never work with pets or children .  
aww ,  the kids .   
action .  
okay .  nowwhat is my first line ?  
 what did we agree ?  
okay  
the good thing about the young kids though ,  theyre completely unpredictable .  which is a lot of fun as an actor to respond with .  but there was one story 
oh little ben .  
where the story was that i was anticipating that i would be around to hear my sons first words spoken .  but the scene was about that he wasnt supposed to be able to speak and ,  uh for some reason when we started doing the show  
hi !  were visiting !  
yay !  
its ben and his da - da .  da - da ?  can you say da - da ?  yknow ,  you might as well say it because i told your 
da da .   
can you say da - da ?  see ,  im gonna tell your mommies you said it anyway ,  so you might as well try 
da da .  
huh ?  
da da .  
yeah ,  hes saying da - da .   
and then sometimes during the show yknow but youre like ,  the scenes going one way but youre just tempted to say something another time .  like ,  do you remember that one where monicas baking cookies in our old apartment ?  
shes trying to intrigue us to hang out with her .  
yeah ,  shes trying to waft the smell across the hall to get us to come hang out in her new place ,  and were sitting there eating pizza and i think it was you  that said  
what do i smell ?   
i think i was supposed to say ,   &quot; i dont know ,  &quot;  and go over and open the door .  and i went  
what do i smell ?  
 sorry .    
 and then it was like four takes later before we could get through it with a straight face .   
what do i smell ?   
le blanc .   
what do i smell ?  
i dont know ,  but it smells good .    
but audiencesyou have a live studio audience and they must love that .  they must love it when they see you guys playing .   
what are you guys doing ?   
nothing .  
nothin .   
so that you will intentionally do something thattheyll - theyll intentionally screw it up ?  
yeah !  
yeah !   
 why ?  whats the matter ?    
 you - youve worn a fat suit on the show .  and ,  a lot of people love you in the fat suit .  do you like wearing the fat suit ?  is it fun ?   
im melting !   
they made me dance ,  in the fat suit .    
i - i heard some of you guys talking about this earlier ,  but sometimes theres just a word that someone has to say that youll get hung up on .  and itll justthe way you say the word is funny to everybody else .   
that tastes like feet !   
it tastes like  feet !  
okay ,  were good .  
action !  
that tastes like feet !    
sometimes the dialogue itself is just so funny and youllwell be rehearsing during the week and you justwhatever - whatever the joke is; its so funny we cant get through it in rehearsal and just 
you just know .  
you - you mentally make a flag on it and you say ,   &quot; okay show night ,  im justill never be able to get through this .  &quot;   
are you saying that you dont want to get with this ?  
you see ,  i dont say  
 oh ,  sweet jesus !  oh !  monica ,  these are the  cookies they serve in hell !   
 whoa !  shes purty !  
oh yeah ,  and shes really nice too !  she taught me about yknow ,  how to work with the cameras and smell - the - fart acting .  
joey ?  
im sorry 
excuse me ,  what ?    
when you have to do physical business for a scene ,  i mean there must be; there must be a lot of funny moments when you have to physically do a task as part of a scene .  
yeah ,  rachel ,  chandler ,  and ross had to try to get a couch up a staira very narrow new york stairwell and that was probably i - i think it was the hardest ive - ive laughed in my life period .   
pivot !   pivot !   okay ,  pivot !  piv - at !    
pivot !  piv - at !  piv - at !  !  
shut up !  shut up !  shut up !  !   
pivat !  !   pivat !  !  !  commercial break

yeah .   yeah .  
im sorry .  i just when i look at you i see her .  when i see her i get a little bit angry .

honey ,  its not just a matter of where you put it .  i mean a baby changes everything .  they cry all the time .  i mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when theres a screaming baby around .  
i could use a challenge !  its getting pretty easy .  
honey ,  its so sweet that you want me to stay ,  but i - i cant do that to you .  i mean it would disrupt your entire life .  
i love living with you so much .  i just wish things didnt have to change .

uh ,  no .  but i could pretend to strip ,  but thats gonna cost extra .  okay ,  heres the extras ,  handcuffs ,  spanking

do you mind if i smoke in here ?  
how could you have kept all of this from me ?  
i was going to tell you ,  but 
but what ?  !  you figured youd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped rachel !  
hey !  i did not dump rachel !   nor are we still together .   can i just  why dont we just let the machine get that ?  
 hey ross .  its joey .  theres a hooker over here and we thought maybe youd know something about it .

when theyre hookers .  
oh my god stu !  i - i cant believe you did this !  now are you absolutely sure shes a hooker ?  
maybe she meant to get you a hooker .

this is the worst bachelor party ever !  
whats taking you boys so long ?

ross im so sorry .  okay .  i - i will promise i will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person ,  or via e - mail .

thank you !  
thank you so much for coming back over .  
oh good ,  youre here .  yeah ,  and i was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable .  
i know mona ,  just hear me out .  first of all ,  im so sorry about my father yelling at you ,  but i heard you totally held your own .  youre gonna have to tell me how you did that .  
focus .  
okay .  um butokay ,  yes ross and i used to date .  and yes we are gonna have a baby .  but we are definitely not getting back together .  
how can i be sure on that ?  
oh we justwe drove each other crazy !  
yeah .  
i mean he was possessive ,  he was jealous ,  he could never just let the little things go !  
trying to date this woman .  
right !  but ,  none of that compared to how kind and - and how gentle and thoughtful he is .   
probably shouldnt touch me .  
yknow ,  i - i - i just i dont want to get in the middle of something so complicated .  
i know ,  i get it ,  but mona ,  what relationship is not complicated ?  i mean we all have our baggage !  you must too !  why else would you still be single ?   i am so gonna leave right now .   
should i leave this open for you too ?  
im not sure yet .  why didnt you just tell me about all this ?  
because whats going on with rachel has nothing to do with how i feel about you .  
yeah ?  well you still shoulda told me .  
i know and i was going to ,  but i thought it was better that you heard it from rachels father .  look i i made a mistake ,  but its only because i really ,  really like you .  really !  
okay ,  i guess you can close the door now .   
i swear i didnt know she was a hooker !  i mean whdid you let her smoke in here ?  
her ass print is still on your grandmothers quilt ,  do you really want to talk about smoking ?  
yknow what ?  im gonna make this up to you .  i promised you a stripper  ,  and youre gonna get a stripper .   
monica !  wait !

 wow ,  you told your dad the truth .  
about an hour ago .  
wanna go see a movie ?  
yes !   bye daddy .   
 theres gonna be a wedding !   thats unacceptable rachel !  what the hell does love have to do with it anyway ?  !  there are more important things in a marriage other than love !   constantly thinking about things !  you have to think about the consequences of your decision .   
hey rach listen ,  did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back .  
 oh my god !  let me see that !   
 you fall for it every time !  
 hey !  
hi !  
i brought you my old maternity clothes !   
oh pheebs thats so sweetooh ,  those are so cute !

he was in rosss class marching band kinda overweight ?  well ,  really overweight .  i mean i was his thin friend .  
wow !  i dont remember him .  honey ,  are you sure youre not talking about your imaginary boyfriend .  
no that was jarred !  wow !  i havent thought about him in a long time  anyway ,  umm wills ,  wills here on business and he didnt have a place to go so i invited him here .  
oh thats nice .  
oh ,  and by the way ,  hes lost a bunch of weight .  i mean he looks goo - ood !  okay ,  i mean really ,  really gorgeous !   i still love chandler .  
i just want you to say it once in a while .

phoebe !  
turkeys are beautiful ,  intelligent animals !  
no theyre not !  theyre ugly and stupid and delicious !  
all right !  okay ,  its just phoebe .  wills still on a diet ,  chandler doesnt eat thanksgiving food ,  and rachels having her aversion to poultry .  
she is ?  
remember i had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken ?  
yeah .  but i thought that was because i put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table .  
anyway ,  it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people .  okay ?  its a lot of work .  
but you gotta have turkey on thanksgiving !  i mean ,  thanksgiving with no turkey is like - like fourth of july with no apple pie !  or friday with no two pizzas !  
all right fine !  if it means that much to you !  but justtheres gonna be a ton left over .  
no there wont !  i promise i will finish that turkey !  
all right ,  youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting ?  
hey ,  isnt weird to think about how next year at this time theyll be a little baby at the table ?   rachels !  but good to know where youre at !  
 hey !  
hey !  
happy thanksgiving !

yes he was .   
no .  no .  
so who else was in this club ?  
uh actually ,  there - there was also that exchange student from thailand but i - i dont think he - he knew what it was .  
so ross ,  we went out for two years ,  and you never told me you were in an i hate rachel club .  
you went out with her ?  !  we had a pact !  
that was in high school !  its not like it was binding forever .  
then why did it have the word eternity in it ?  
okay monica ,  did you know about this ?  !  
i swear i didnt .   hey !  is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door ?  
hmm ,  a little relieved ,  i gotta say .  
look rach i - im sorry ,  okay ?  i i was a stupid kid ,  okay ?  the only reason i joined 
co - founded !  
co - founded .  co - founded the club was because i was insanely in love with you .  obviously i didnt handle it very well .  but if you think about it the i hate rachel club was really the i love rachel club .  
uh ,  except that it was really the i hate rachel club .  
okay .  so what ?  you guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me ?  
well ,  we did a little more than that .  
no - no !  no - no .  no - no .  
what ?  !  what else did you do ?  
we started a rumor .  
what rumor ?  
oh ,  come on will !  just take off your shirt and tell us !  
ross !  
it was no big deal .  we - we said that the rumor was that umm you had both male and female reproductive parts .  
what ?  !  
thats right !  we said your parents flipped a coin ,  decided to raise you as a girl ,  but you still had a hint of a penis .  
 oh my god !  
you started that ?  !  
what ?  !  you heard that ?  !   
everyone at our school heard it !  
everybody at my school heard it !  you were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from long island ?  !  
oh no !  !  !  !  oh my god !  !  this is all making so much sense to me now !  this is why adam carter wouldnt go out with me !  this is why billy tratt would just stay in this region !   
actually ,  billy tratt is gay now .  so - so that ones not really our fault .  
monica ,  how come you never told me this ?  !  
i thought it might be true .  and i was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me .   
joey stop staring !  theres nothing there !  its not true !  
im afraid im gonna need proof .  
oh !   the turkey ,  until he turns the plate around and reveals he only ate one side . ] 
you are my everest .  
joey ,  you dont have to finish that .  
oh yes i do .  otherwise whats next ?  today im just a guy who cant finish a turkey ,  but tomorrow im the guy who eats half a powerbar ,  wraps up the rest ,  and puts in the fridge ?  no !  no ,  i just i justi gotta change my pants .   jeans have no give .

i was working late in the library one afternoon .  it was just the two of us .  she needed some help with her word jumble .  and one thing led to another .  if you must know ,  anita was very gentle and tender .  may she rest in peace

well yknow ,  im just - im just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money .  or !  or your assistant will see them and - and want a raise !  
do you think i work at some kind of boot pricing company ?  
anyway ,  i picked up this outfit that i want to wear and the ,  and the boots dont really go with it .

jack ?  i hate him !  hes a jerk .  
now ben ,  sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside ,  but they have famous fathers .

yes !  yes you can ,  im looking for jacks parents .  
uh - huh ,  im with ben .  
i am one of bens mothers .  im a lesbian .  it was ,  it was difficult coming out to my parents .  
oh .  
ah !  okay so that would make me susan .  problems hes having with ben ?   yeah .  because i really do think the parents should sit down and have a conversation .  
yeah !  lets do that !  !  that - that sounds good .  we should sit down and talk ,  just me ,  my lover carol ,  and the stings .  umm ,  how - how will i get in touch with them ?  
yknow ,  that party wasnt bad .  
yeah !  i didnt know there would be dancing .  that was a fun surprise !  
i dont see any uh ,  cabs .  maybe we should just walk ?

i cant walk .  okay ?  okay ?  these boots were a huge mistake !  
what ?  
okay you were right !  all right ,  i never should have bought them !  theyre killing me !  one toe at a time !

hop on .  
okay .  wait ,  just give me a second ,  i need to just get my boots off first .   ah ooh oohh ohh oh god ohh oh ohh ohhhh

yknow what ?  you can say goodbye to the tan ones .  
okay .   all right .

joey ,  just because theyre not getting married doesnt mean this is going to be a disaster .  maybe they have a plan !  
oh ?  oh !  okay !  okay !  lets hear their plan !  now ,  whats the future look like for dina and bobby ?  
well i really have high hopes for my band .

 really ?   
dina ,  if youre having a baby you should be married !  even if it is to bobby !   dude ,  thats not a compliment !  
no joey !  i knew you wouldnt be supportive !  
so whoa - whoa - whoa - whoa !  what are you gonna do ?  youre gonna have the baby and - and raise it by yourself without a husband ?  !  you cant be a single mother alone !  youre gonna ruin your life !  
oh excuse me !  am i ruining my life ?

like asking her to move in with you ?  
smaller than that .  
making her a mixed tape ?  
uh ,  bigger than that .  
give her a key to your apartment .  
whoa - hello !  we were closer with the mixed tape .

i dont think you had an open mind about the name ruth .  i mean ,  come on ,  little ruthie geller ,  how - how cute is that ?  
oh ,  oh my god !  i can practically hear the mahjong tiles !  the sex of the baby ?  
uh ,  no .  no ,  were not .  
but you have it right there in that file ?  you could tell us whether its a boy or a girl ?  dayton or sandrine ?  phoebe or phoebo ?  
no ,  no ,  we want to wait ,  right ?  
right .  right .  its really not my place ,  but please dont name your child phoebo .  
 so ,  which of these babies do you think is the ugliest ?  
what ?  rach !  come on ,  thats terrible !  theyre uh theyre babies .  theyre - theyre all beautiful .  
third one from the left ?  
yeah ,  why is it staring at me ?  i think it knows im talking about it .   dont - dont youwhwhahey !  !  
what ?  !  
youre looking !  
i didnt !  
i saw you !  
okay fine ,  i did .  but i didnt see anything ,  i swear .  
shame on you !  ugly baby judges you !  
okay ,  but ross just listen to me 
no ,  no ,  no ,  no !  dont tell me !  i dont want to know !  
but i couldnt even if i wanted to ,  because i dont know !  i swear; i didnt see anything ,  and i dont want to know !  it was just a momentary lapse .  
momentary lapse .  dont - dont you have any self - control ?  
hello ?  
im in the bathroom ,  can you come in here ?  i think theres something wrong .  
you know what ?  i - i think ill wait out here .  
im in the bathtub .  
oh .   whats wrong ?  
i drew my own bath ,  but i did it wrong !  the waters tepid .  the salt didnt dissolve and is now lodged places .  and the scents i used dont compliment each other .  eucalyptus and chamomileoh !  
what ?  
the bath salts !  theyre starting to effervesce !  its different .   its interesting .  
okay ,  lets talk about something else .  
yeah !  sure ,  sure .  so ,  what was going on with you today ?  oh - oh - oh !  
well ,  i actually had the weirdest conversation with joey .  he was talking about rules and right and wrong and 
i had the exact same conversation .  
you did ?  what was he talking about ?  
i dont know !  joey hasnt had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in macbeth !  
 that was a long night .  
all right ,  lets break this down .  what exactly did he say to you ?  
okay ,  he was talking about rules .  
uh - huh .  
umm ,  and looking at people differently .  
he didnt say anything about that to me .  
what did he tell you ?  
he was asking all these questions about you ,  me ,  and london .  and ,  of course the glue that holds this all together ,  the rules .  
okay .  so you ,  me and london .  looking at people differently .  maybe he wants to do what you and i did in london with someone .  
but what did he mean by rules ?  
wait a minute !  he stopped talking the minute phoebe came in !  
because he was looking at her differently .  
and phoebe is his friend ,  so he thinks that would be breaking the rules !  
my god !  he wants to do it with phoebe in london !  
 you guys ?  
just a minute !   thats mrs .  tribbiani !  
you dont say anything .  
why would i say anything ?  that two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives !  and they would have me to thank ,  and we could all start having babies ?  
im not going to let you say anything .  
you just stay here !   
oh ,  god !   
oh ,  hey ,  monica ,  i brought back your iron .  
oh ,  you had that ?  
uh - huh .  
i thought i lost it .  i got a new one ,  like ,  a month ago .  
oh ,  just as well ,  i broke this one .   
what ?  
nothing .  
okay .  
i mean ,  i - i ,  i really shouldnt say .  i mean ,  im really not supposed to .  
fine .  
its a humdinger !  
then its really too bad that you cant tell me .  
somebody likes you !  
 is it chandler ?  
no !  
well ,  then tell him to stop staring !  
its joey !  
really ?  !  joey ?  !  you dont say .  
is it something youd be interested in ?  
i dont know ,  i dont know ,  i dont know .  you know ,  i mean ,  on the one hand ,  mother may i ?  but yknow on the other hand no .  no ,  i cant .  were friends .  no ,  oh ,  no .  i dont want to risk what we have .  
i guess that makes sense .  so ,  you think youre going to talk to him ?  
sure ,  yeah .  i mean ,  its joey .  i dont want him to get hurt .  well ,  i must say ,  i am on fire !  first chandler ,  now joey !  
not chandler ,  just joey .  
hey .  
hey .  
you know what ?  ive been thinking about it .  im really coming around on the name ruth .  i think i would actually consider naming our child that .  
rach ,  i - i cant tell you how - how much that means to me !  ohh wait a minute .  wait a minute .  you - you hated the name ruth !  why - why would you change your mind ?  unless ,  you know were never going to have to use it .  you did see the folder .  you know its a boy !  
i didnt see anything !  i actually changed my mind about the name .  
i dont think so !  youre just giving me ruth so youll get to name it when its a boy ,  and thats when youll swoop in and name him heath or blaine or sequoia .  
i wouldsequoia ?  
veto .  
fine .  
unless  you anticipated that i would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl ,  and you really do want her to be named ruth !  well ,  im not falling for that !  okay ?  ruth is off the table !  
but ross ,  you want the name ruth !  
hey .  
hey .  well ,  whats up ?  
umm ,  joey ,  i know .  
what ?  
i knooow .  
whaaat ?  
i know about your feelings .  
oh my god .  you do ?  
yes ,  and im sorry .  i - i know things worked out for chandler and monica ,  but thats very rare .  
i know .  i know .  and this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys .  i mean ,  its rachel for god sakes .  
for god sakes ,  its rachel !  
i know .  i know .  and shes not only my friend; shes my pregnant friend !  shes my pregnant friend whos ross ex !  
yeah thats rachel .   beat me over the head with it .  
what am i going to do ?  you know ,  and i keep ,  i keep trying to get rid of these feelings ,  yknow ?  i stayed up all last night and made a list of everything i dont like about her .  you want to hear it ?  
yeah .  
she made me switch to light mayo .  thats it !  thats all i got !  and ,  you know what ?  it tastes the same and my pants fit better !  
joey ,  i just think youre getting worked up over nothing .  this is probably just a crush .  
you think ?  
absolutely !  yknow ,  you get this rush of feelings ,  but then it goes away .  
yeah ,  just a crush !  thats all this is !  its a crush !  im joey; i dont get deep feelings .

and here we go 
i saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it ,  and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh .  yknow it wouldnt kill ya to respect your wifes privacy !   stupid closet full of bugs !  
joey .  joey ,  something feels weird and not good weird .  i dontwhoa !  !

uh ,  really good .  really good .  yeah ,  i should be ready to kill myself any day now .   wow ,  you sure found that quick .   i justi wish i didnt feel this way about rachel anymore ,  yknow ?  i wish things could go back to normal .  i mean ,  i love living with her and god ,  helping out with the baby is just amazing ,  but now i think i think ross feels left out .  yknow ?  when i had to take rachel to the hospital ,  the doctor thought i was the father .  god you shouldve seen the look on rosss face .   by the way ,  i have no idea what im doing here .  for all i know im just locking it more .  oh hey ,  did you try opening it with a credit card ?  
thats a good idea .

yeah ?  
maybe you two should live together .  
are you asking me to move out ?  do you not want me here ?  
oh no - no ,  no - no i love living with you .  it just seems that if youre gonna have a roommate ,  yknow it might as well be the father .  
but joey ,  i dont think ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that .  i meanor he does .  
no i - i - i would love to be around for you and the baby .  and we - we can just try it like on a temporary basis .

so ,  whatd you tell him ?  
how could you not tell mona that rachel is living with you ?

oh ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  i will !  i just want to butter her up ,  first !  you know ,  im going to take her to an amazing valentines dinner .  do all this romantic stuff ,  and then ,  just when she thinks im the best boyfriend in the world ,  then im going to tell her that my pregnant ex - girlfriend is living with me .  
so ,  between her and me being friends ,  and her history with ross ,  it just isnt going to happen .  it would be like you falling in love with a cat .

oh ,  im sorry !  do you need the phone ?  
no ,  no .  listen ,  ross is too nice to say anything ,  but this is his apartment ,  and ,  and ,  we gotta have some boundaries ,  so why dont you go back to your place and give us some privacy ?  
 but ,  but ,  mona ,  i live here .  
how long has it been this time ?  
90 seconds .  
thats better .  90 seconds is a long time not to think about it except all i did was think about it .  
you know ,  it haunts me ?  up til now ,  the worst thing i ever saw ,  was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy .  after this ,  i would gladly make that my screensaver !  
okay ,  well ,  we have to get past this !  why dont we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed ?  
i can do that .  
okay .   
okay .  now all weve got to do is get rid of this chair .   
oh ,  thank god !  
oh ,  i know !  
come in !  
 hi !  im so sorry to barge in on your valentines ,  but i had to get away from all the yelling .  mona is dumping ross .  
oh ,  my god .  
poor ross .   
oh ,  great .  we have to watch him do yoga in his underwear ,  but for this he closes the drapes !  
rach ,  you know that birthing tape you wanted to see ?  its here .  
oh ,  and we should warn you ,  before you watch it 
why ?  you saw it ?  is it scary ?  
well ,  lets just say its ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself .  
well ,  now ,  wait .  now im all freaked out .  come on ,  you guys will watch it with me .  
no ,  but i will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you !  
cmon ,  seriously ,  you guys ,  youre not going to make me watch this alone !

oh ,  man ,  im sorry .  why ?  
well ,  with everything thats been going on lately ,  i havent exactly been the perfect boyfriend .  you know ,  i ,  uh ,  i didnt tell her i got rachel pregnant .  i gave her a key to my apartment ,  and then had the locks changed !  and then i lied to her about rachel moving in with me .  in a way ,  i actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner ,  you know ?  
still ,  that really sucks ,  man .  especially on valentines day .  
yeah .  wait a minute .  what are you doing here ?  joey tribbiani without a date on valentines day ?  whats going on ,  huh ?  girl trouble ?

well then you just must have a natural talent for it .  
yknow what ?  the doctor will be in soon ,  why dont we not speak until then .  
 okay .   seriously ,  breathe louder ross !  thats great !  
yknow we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby thats half human and half pure evil !   
hi dr .  long ,  how are you ?  
 oh ,  youre nice to her .  
she has the drugs !  
okay .   
yeah .  
eh ,  just a tad .  still could last a little while longer .  if youre anxious there are a few ways to help things along .  
do them !  !  in my experience ive found that some of them are quite effective .  
well ,  we are ready to try anything .  
okay .  
great !  we will do all of those .  taking a long walk ,  and then theres the one thats  
good job joe !  well done !  top notch !

no .  but she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor .  
yeah ,  we tried them all .  we went for a walk ,  uh we tried a special tea ,  caster oil ,  spicy food nothing has worked .  
well ,  there is one thing that we havent tried ,  but someone thinks that ,    &quot; that will open up a can of worms .  &quot;  
well what is it ?  what is it ?  if its gonna help bring the baby here ,  like today .  i mean ,  i think you should do it .  
its sex .  
do it !  
monica !  
im just saying its been a really long time for you .  i mean ,  women have needs .  do it ,  get yours !  
oh i - i dont know about that .  no ,  i think that if the two of you had sex the - the - the repercussions would be catastrophic .  
all right ,  lets be practical ,  if ross isnt willing to do it ,  hes not the only guy in the world you can have sex with .  you can borrow chandlerchandler is good !  
monica ,  what is the matter with you ?  
nothing .  i just want the baby to be born today .

okay well ,  i was down on one knee with the ring in my hand 
as we all are at some point during the day .  
it wasnt my ring !  it fell out of rosss jacket !  and when i knelt down to pick it up rachel thought i was proposing !  
ross had a ring ?  !  and he was gonna propose ?  
i guess .  
and you did it first ?  !  this is gonna kill him !  you know how much he loves to propose !  
i know !  i know its awful .  
well ,  what did she say ?  
 she said yes .  
does ross know ?  
oh god ,  what the hell am i going to tell him ?  
well maybe you dont have to tell him anything .  
oh ,  i like that .  yeah 
if you clear things up with rachel then ross never needs to find out ,  but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass !  
 now lets not get carried away .   
i want a baby .  
honey ,  weve been over this .  i need to be facing the other way .  
come on !  come on ,  if we have sex again itll double our chances of getting pregnant .  do you think that closets still available ?  
im so tired .   yeah okay ,  but no foreplay .  
deal !   
dad seriously !  yknow you really should see someone about that !  
noted .  
i wanna go talk to rachel for a minute ,  are you gonna be okay alone for a bit ?

oh my god !  he did it ?  
welldid you know he was gonna ask me ?

and you really think this is a good idea ?  
i just talked him into it ,  dont tell me i have to do you too .  the puppet master gets tired people .  
i just dont know !  it just doesnt feel right .

okay sweetie ,  you can do it .  just open up and put it in your mouth .  
dear lord .  
im sorry honey ,  what were you saying ?  
oh uh - uh yeah ,  i think that 
oh look ,  shes pulling away again !  do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth ?   she looks scared .  doesnt she look scared ?  
yknow ,  i dont really know her .  
why dont we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow .   
 are you kidding me ?  !  
its just so frustrating !  why doesnt she want my breast ?  !  
oh hey !  wait up !  
hi !  
congratulations !  i didnt want to say anything in front of joey cause i didnt know if he knew yet .  
what ,  that we had a baby ?  come on lets give him a little credit ,  although ,  he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier .  
no !  no ,  that you and rachel are engaged !  
what ?  
oh ,  its a secret .  oh goodie !  yes !  we havent done the secret thing in a long time .  
phoebe ,  there is no secret .  okay ?  i didnt propose .  
are you lying ?  is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor ?  
 i am a doctor !  yknow what ?  im just gonna go and talk to rachel myself .  
all right ,  me too .   should we wake her up ?  
no !  no ,  come on let her sleep !  shes so exhausted .  
and so engaged .   
what ?   oh my god !  she - she thinks were engaged !  why ?  why ?  why would she think were engaged ?  !  
perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring ?  yknow ross doctors are supposed to be smart .  
i didnt give her that ring !  
really ?  
no !  
so whose ring is it ?  
its mine .  
is it an engagement ring ?  
yes !  
but you didnt give it to her ?  
no !  
but you were going to propose ?  
no !  !  
huh ,  i might be losing interest in this .  
look .  look ,  my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to rachel ,  but all i wanted to do is if she maybekindawanted ahstartthings up again .  
oh ,  what beautiful lukewarm sentiment .  
look ,  i didnt want to rush into anything .  and it seemed like she didnt want to either .  but i dont ,  i dont understand how any of this happened !  what ?  did she find the ring in my jacket ,  assume that i was going to propose ,  throw it on ,  and - and just start telling people ?  
no !  no ,  she said you actually proposed to her .  
look ,  we cant stay in here forever .  
oh ,  i still cant believe my dad saw us having sex !  he didnt make it to one of piano recitals ,  but this he sees !  
this is okay .  were all adults here; theres nothing to be ashamed of .  now ,  lets put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door .   
hi dad !  i can still call you that right ?  
of course .  ill always be your dad .  
i just want you to know that what you witnessed in there ,  that wasnt for fun .  
it wasnt fun ?  !  
 why ?  why - why - would youwh - why  look ,  i just dont want you to think that were animals who do it whenever we want .  
oh ,  i dont think that .  before today i never thought of you two having sex at all .  it was a simpler time .  
the truth is ,  dad ,  were - were trying .  
what ?  
yeah ,  were trying to get pregnant .  
oh my god !  this is so exciting !  well ,  get back in there !   ill guard the door !  
well ,  thats okay dad ,  we - we can wait until later .  
whoa - whoa - whoa !  i dont think so !  arent you ovulating ?  
daddy ?  !  
well you gotta get at it princess !  when your mother and i were trying to conceive you ,  whenever she was ovulating ,  bam ,  we did it .  thats how i got my bad hip .  
thats funny ,  this conversations how i got the bullet hole in my head .  
this one time i had my knee up on the sink and your mother ,  she was 
daddy !  i dont think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex .  
youre right ,  youre right .  this is about your positions .  now ,  what i saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child ,  although it might feel good .  
i dont feel good right now .  
but pleasure is important ,   and it helps if the woman has an orgasm .  you up to the task sailor ?  
hey .  
hey .  i need to tell you something .  
well ,  nows a good time .  im on my way to have my ears cut off .

rach ,  i told you ,  you can &apos;t call him every time any little thing comes up .  
yeah well ,  not anymore i can &apos;t .  he fired us !  what are we gonna do ?  we have to find a pediatrician .  wait wait ,  monica said that when you guys were growing up ,  you really liked your doctor .  what was his name ?  
dr .  gettleman ?  yeah i know ,  i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .  in fact ,  i think he &apos;s dead .  
argh !  why does everything happen to me ?  !  
rach ,  i promise first thing tomorrow we &apos;ll find another doctor ,  but i gotta get up early and i &apos;m not feeling all that well .  
what ?  what ,  do you mean you &apos;re not feeling well ?  what do you have ?  is it rubella ?  because don &apos;t go near emma ,  she has not had that shot .

 wiener ,  wiener  wiener ,  wiener !  !  !  
 rachel !  !  !  
 hey !  
hey !  
so how is this for our big double date tonight ?

of course not !  and you &apos;re gonna love mary ellen .  she &apos;s really smart and cute and funny ,  and i can &apos;t tell you how i know this ,  but she &apos; not opposed to threesomes .  so tell me some about my guy .  
no .  
come on ,  give me something .  what &apos;s his name ?  
mike .  
mike ?  okay !  what &apos;s his last name ?  
damnit !  is there no mystery left in romance anymore !  ?  
all right ,  we &apos;ll se you and mike at the restaurant in a couple hours .  
it &apos;s impossible to find a good doctor .  i mean ,  how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee ?  
excuse me ?  
i know what she &apos;s talking about .  
we &apos;ve got to find a new pediatrician .  ross was getting sick last night ,  and i think emma may have caught it .  
why don &apos;t you go see dr .  gettleman ?  
ross said he died .  
he didn &apos;t die .  i saw his daughter last week .  said he was fine .  her on the other hand ,  botched botox .  
oh ,  great !  well ,  then i &apos;m gonna take emma to see him .  i wonder why ross said that he died .  
oh ,  maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist .  
he saw a therapist ?  
yeah ,  he used to have this recurring nightmare ,  just really freaked him out .  
why ?  what was it ?  
that i was going to eat him .  
 
mike !  !  !  
yeah ?  
i gotta tell you ,  i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m doing this with you .  although i did just get out of a nine - year relationship ,  so i guess i should be open and taking some risks .  
everything is gonna be fine .  just follow my lead ,  okay ?  all you have to do is pretend to be mike .  
i am mike .  
atta boy !   
okay ,  look .  .  .  
joey ,  this is mary ellen jenkins .  so ,  mike ,  how do you and joey know each other anyway ?  
how do i and joey know each other ?  wow ,  if i had a nickel for every time somebody has asked me that .  
 from school .  
yeah ,  we met in college .   i mean ,  high school .  
wow ,  you guys go way back then .  so what are you up to these days ?  
well ,  i &apos;m a lawyer .  
mike ,   &apos;attorney at law &apos; !  
actually ,  i just gave up my practice .  
what ?  that &apos;s the kinda thing you usually run by me .  
i always wanted to play piano professionally ,  and i figured if i don &apos;t do this now ,  i never will .  
wow ,  that &apos;s great !  i liked that better than the law thing ,  so .  .  .  
which is why i waited until now to introduce you to mike .  
no ,  no ,  that &apos;s not what i meant .  let &apos;s get you a cocktail .

slim pickings .

no ,   &apos;slim pickings &apos; ,  it &apos;s a barbecue restaurant .  they &apos;re looking for a cook .  actually  &apos;cook &apos; may be a bit of a stretch .  they &apos;re looking for someone to shovel mesquite .

dr .  gettleman is finishing up with a patient ,  he should be out shortly .  not strep .  
thanks doctor .  
you know ,  it &apos;s so surprising that you and joey have known each other for so long and i &apos;ve never heard about you .  
yeah ,  that &apos;s because we had a bit of a falling out .  mike hit my mom with a car .  
no ,  i didn &apos;t .  
that &apos;s okay mike ,  i have forgiven you .  and now we &apos;re friends again everything &apos;s great !  mary ellen wait ,  is your mom okay ?

what ?  !  
what ?  !  
do you not know each other ?  
 of course we do !  mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school .  yeah ,  where we pretend we don &apos;t know each other .  we played all kinds of games .   hey ,  remember the one where i punch you in the face for not being cool ?  !  
mike ,  let me ask you something .  how many sisters does joey have ?  
 six !

joey ,  why did you set me up with a stranger ?  
because i forgot about our date ,  i &apos;m so sorry .

 you are unbelievable !  i spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you ,  you know .  mary ellen is really smart and cute and loose .  
who are you kidding ?   you just find some guy off the street for me ?  oh god !  this is humiliating !  
look phoebe i &apos;m so sorry !  hey ,  look ,  if you don &apos;t like this guy i can find you a better one .   mike !  !  mike !  !  
i &apos;m out of here  
it was nice meeting you !  
 you &apos;re leaving too ?  
honey ,  we &apos;re leaving tomorrow you &apos;ve still got a lot of packing to do .  
you &apos;re right .   maybe i shouldn &apos;t go .  
what ?  
so nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant ,  javo  .  it &apos;s just a little outside of tulsa .  
how far outside ?  
manhattan .  
and you &apos;re thinking of taking it ?   so before you said being me with me was more important than any job ,  but i guess now it &apos;s old job ,   me ,   new job .  
i &apos;m gonna miss this hand !  okay i know it &apos;s a lot to ask ,  but oh my god chandler ,  this is a once in a lifetime opportunity .  
what happened to  &apos;you can &apos;t live without me four days a week &apos; ?  
well ,  if you really think about it ,  i mean four days is not that long .  i mean ,  i see you monday before you go to work ,  and i see you thursday when you get back ,  and i always work late on tuesdays ,  so really if you think about it ,  it &apos;s really just one day .  and well ,  if we can &apos;t make it one day ,  we &apos;ve got real problems my friend .  
i think you should take the job .  
really ?  
yeah .  i know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey .  
that &apos;s the nicest anyone has ever said to me !   
hey !  
how was the pediatrician ?  
oh ,  i really liked him .   yeah ,  it was really ,  really ,  really good .  
you promised you wouldn &apos;t say anything .  
i know .   ross still sees his pediatrician !  !  !   i don &apos;t care !  
are you serious ?  you still see dr .  gettleman ?  
he &apos;s a brilliant diagnostician !  
diagnostician or boo - boo fixer ?  
ross ,  seriously !  you &apos;ve gotta go to an appropriate doctor .  
why ?  why ?  i know it &apos;s a little weird ,  but hey ,  he &apos;s a great doctor ,  okay ?  he knows my medical history ,  and every time i go in there ,  he makes a big deal .   &apos;ah look ,  it &apos;s my favorite patient !  &apos; 
does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy ?  
hey ,  i seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college !  
that was not a security blanket !  that was a wall - hanging !  
excuse me ,  hi .  i was hoping i would run into you .  can we talk ?  
sure .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  really ,  i &apos;m so embarrassed .  really ,  i &apos;m a pretty nice guy .  just ask my parole officer .  .  . apparently i &apos;m not a funny guy .  
why did you go along with that ?  
because i was told i &apos;d get a free dinner ,  which i didn &apos;t .  and that i &apos;d meet a pretty girl .  which i did .  
that &apos;s true .   well ,  is anything you told me about yourself true ?  
my name in mike ,  and i do play piano .  
prove it .  
there isn &apos;t a piano here .  
that wouldn &apos;t stand in the way of a true pianist .  
you are really good !  i play a little guitar myself .  
really ?  
uhuh .  
that &apos;s great .  what kind of music do you play ?  
well ,  like acoustic folksy stuff .  you know ?  but right now i &apos;m working on a couple  &apos;iron maiden &apos; covers .  
do you think that maybe ,  sometime ,  i could .  .  .  
it &apos;s okay .  go ahead ,  ask me out .  
okay .  do you think maybe sometime i could take you out ?  
 
 oh ,  you just caught me off guard !  yeah ,  that would be nice .  
excuse me ,  i don &apos;t mean to be a jerk ,  but the baby with the rash came in after me .  
the doctor will be right with you sir .  
 mommy ,  i can &apos;t find waldo .

what means if he gets like a disease or kills someone .  not if he gets his jollys to jaws !  
ah !  you know what honey guys are just different ,  they like things that we can &apos;t understand ,  you know i once dated this guy who wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and i was a naughty cave woman that he unfroze from a block of ice .  
eww are you talking about my bother .  
yeah i didn &apos;t disguise that very well did i .  
 hey 
 hi 
listen to this .  .  .  i went out with this girl last night and half way through our date i realized i already slept with her .   
so basically you &apos;ve slept with all the woman in new york and now you &apos;re just going around again .  
well that &apos;s not even the weird part .  i don &apos;t think she remembered sleeping with me .  
but you don &apos;t remember sleeping with her .  
yeah but she should remember sleeping with me i am very memorable ,  you guys know .  
what ,  how do we know ,  we never slept with you .  
and who &apos;s fault is that .  
what &apos;s the big deal ,  you forgot ,  she forgot ,  maybe you were having an off night 
hey !  i never have an off night ok although sometimes when i &apos;m a little bloated i don &apos;t feel very sexy but even then i &apos;m better then most !  
honey why don &apos;t you just let it go and ask her out again .  
yeah your both so slutty you don &apos;t even remember who you &apos;ve slept with ,  you &apos;re made for each other .  
interesting .  all right i &apos;ll go out with her again and try to get past it  oh salt bloaty !  
joey ,  joey .  
what ?  
you don &apos;t think sharks are sexy do you ?  
it &apos;s open .  
hey !  
hey !  mike called were going out again !  yay !  yay !   
yay !   quick thing ,  i went to talk to mike .  
what ?  wha - wha - wha - did you do ross !  
oh boy you got mad at that part .  i went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me blah ,  blah ,  blah ,  and i ended up telling him that .  
what !  
umm .  that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named vicrum .  
what !  why ?  
well he seemed to bum hard that you &apos;d never been in a serious relationship .  
 if you hadn &apos;t just had a baby with my best friend i swear to lucifer a rabid dog would be feasting on your danglers right now !  
well phoebe ,  i think you &apos;ll feel better when you know a little bit about vicrum ,  his a kite designer  and he used to date oprah .   
i &apos;m not going along with some lie you made ross ,  no i &apos;m just gonna be honest with him .  
good yeah just be honest with him .  
yeah i &apos;ve nothing to be ashamed of ok so i haven &apos;t been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month .  ok i haven &apos;t had a real boyfriend you know if he can &apos;t handle that he can leave .  which he will and that &apos;s ok .  so i &apos;ll just be alone forever you know alright i &apos;ll be .  it &apos;ll be fine .  it &apos;ll be fine .  i &apos;ll go walking tours with widows and lesbians .  oh  
i &apos;ll get it 
ok 
 you know i &apos;m trying to think of the last time i opened a door and you weren &apos;t there ,  phoebe are you ok ?   
so it was kind of a shock after 25 years of marriage my parents ,  a perfect couple getting divorced ,  i kinda took it the hardest cause i was the youngest .  
uh huh ,  sure ,  yeah .  how can you not remember me ?  
what ?  
how could you not remember that we slept together ?  
what !  when ?  
i dunno !  
i really ,  really think i would remember sleeping with you 
come on ,  come on ,  search your brain all right .  it was  a certain amount of time ago ,  i was here you were here ,  we had sex  here ,  here ,  here not there .  anything ?  
no it &apos;s not ringing any bells .  
my god woman !  how many people do you have to had been with not to remember any of this ?  
 . and i said vicrum you can &apos;t just call every time you get lonely you know ,  you ,  you gave up that right when you slept with rachel .  
but rachel i thought she just had a baby with ross 
yeah well  yeah you know emma &apos;s birth certificate might say geller but her eyes say mookurgee .  
that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer .  
i know but he call &apos;s and my heart goes to him .  you know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer .  
i just think there &apos;s somebody better out there for you ,   i mean i &apos;m not saying me but .  maybe me .  
oh .  
and you don &apos;t have to worry about glue sniffing with me .  although i do smell the occasional magic marker ,  yeah ah anyway i just think i can make you happy .  
ok i can &apos;t do this .  
what &apos;s wrong ?  
well there is no vicrum ,  ross made him up because i never really have been in a long - term relationship ,  i &apos;ve never lived with a guy ,  and i &apos;ve never even celebrated an anniversary so .   if that &apos;s too weird for you and you wanna leave i totally understand .  in fact i &apos;ll close my eye &apos;s make it less awkward  you kissed me .  
uh huh 
so you don &apos;t think i &apos;m a total freak 
no .  well look can i think your weird and also cool for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you .  
i guess so ,  can i .  can i think it &apos;s cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again  and umm ,  be a little concerned about the magic markers .  
definitely 
hi honey i &apos;m home !  
hi ,  how was your flight ?   
oh it was great .  
here why don &apos;t you sit down ,  get yourself comfortable because i .   have a little surprise for you .  
well ,  well ,  well it must be five in tulsa because it &apos;s six o clock in nyc !  
ok  this is how much i love you .   
 honey why am i watching a bunch of sharks swimming around .  
is this not the good part ?  do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier .  
no i &apos;m not quite sure you got the right movie that &apos;s all .  
oh well this is the only one they had at our video store ,  but they did have something called crocodile killers .  or does it always have to be sharks ?  
does what always have to be sharks .  
honey look we can do something else ,  do you want me to get into the tub and thrash .  
what &apos;s going on ?

let me be a part of this !  
i saw what you were doing in tulsa .  angry sharks turn you on !  
no they don &apos;t 
then why were you watching them and giving yourself a treat .  
oh my god !  when you came in i switched the channel ,  i was just watching regular porn

i cannot tell you how happy that makes me !   
you are an amazing wife .   no really you &apos;re amazing you were actually gonna do this for me ,  i mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that .  
 see ordinarily i would talk to her ,  but my confidence is shaken did i sleep with her ?  did i not sleep with her ?  
you know maybe this is a wake up call ,  about your whole dating attitude .  your in your thirty &apos;s and you &apos;ve never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship ,  here you go from woman to woman ,  meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesn &apos;t tern into anything serious .

okay ,  when i got divorced ,  i didn &apos;t think i &apos;d feel this way about someone for a really long time .  .  .  then again ,  i didn &apos;t think i &apos;d meet someone like you .  .  .  and .  .  .  this may be crazy soon ,  but .  .  .  i want you to have this .  .  .   no ,  not .  .  .  that &apos;s gum .   ooh ,  five bucks .  .  .  i love it when that happens ,  you know .  .  .  think no note &apos;s there .  .  .  
 i know mike ,  why don &apos;t you keep digging ?

it &apos;s to my apartment .  
 oh wow ,  ooh !  ooh ,  big step for phoebe and mike .  
yeah ,  look ,  and i don &apos;t want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because .  .  .  
oh no ,  i want to .

is this cool ,  huh ?  
it really is .  
so i don &apos;t go back to work for another four weeks ,  but we would like our nanny to start right away ,  so that emma could get a chance to know her .  the easier we can make the transition for her ,  the better .

who cares ,  it got you here .  
well ,  it got me to new york anyway ,  and then i got on a cab at the airport ,  and the guy said where to ?  and i just .  .  .  gave him your address i .  .  .  i .  .  .  i didn &apos;t even think about it .  
wow .  where is your luggage ?   
damn it !  
a - allright ,  well .  .  .  i &apos;ll call the cab company .  
wa .  .  .  wa .  .  .  wait !  we can .  .  .  call them later .  can you just .  .  .  just stand there f - f - for a moment ?  boy !  there &apos;s an old russian expression ,  uhm .  .  .  it 
schto ya ztez vigul .  .  .  ui !  roughly translated that means uhm .  .  .  this thing 
thank you !  god ,  no !  you should see me when .  .  .  oh actually ,  no ,  i look pretty good .  
are .  .  .  are you kidding ?  you know ,  when you don &apos;t see someone for a long time ,  a - a - and you kind of build them up in your head and you start thinking 
come on ,  don &apos;t be crazy .  nobody is that beautiful ,  but .  .  .  well ,  you are .   well ,  so ,  uhm .  .  .  are you seeing .  .  .  anyone ?   
i &apos;m .  .  .  i &apos;m just .  .  .  i &apos;m the worst person ever .  how can i not tell david that i &apos;m seeing mike ?  
maybe he didn &apos;t give you a chance .  
he said 
oh ,  well .  .  .  that had been your window .  
yeah !  i mean ,  i don &apos;t know .  i was just  ,  i was looking ,  i was looking just ,  he &apos;s so irresistible .  
really ?  the scientist guy ?  
really ?  chandler ?  
continue .  .  .  
oh . okay ,  then it gets worse ,   &apos;cause then i told him that i would see him tomorrow night .  
phoebe !  
i know !   evil !  and .  .  .  and .  .  .  and .  .  .  i like mike so much ,  you know .  it &apos;s just going really well .  oh my god !  
wow ,  isn &apos;t it ironic that david would show up on the same day that you and mike exchange keys ?  
 uhuh .  .  .  yeah .  .  .  !  ,  you know .  and given my life long search for irony ,  you can imagine how happy i am .  
what are you gonna do ?  
i mean i guess ,  i just have to .  .  .  tell david that nothing can happen between us .  unless i don &apos;t .  .  .  you know ,  complicated moral situation ,  no right ,  no wrong .  .  .  
you have to tell david !  
 funniest guy she &apos;s ever met !   i &apos;m funny ,  right .  .  .  ?  what do you know ,  you &apos;re a door .  .  .  you just like knock - knock jokes .  .  .   save it for inside !   
heeeeeey !  
hey !  
hey !  
so .  .  .  oklahoma is a crazy place .  you know ,  they call it the sooner state .  frankly i &apos;d sooner be in any other state .   and what &apos;s with oklahoma having a pan handle ?  can all states have stuff like that ?  hey yeah ,  i &apos;m from the waistband ,  wyoming .  but when i was seven ,  we headed over to the crotch .  
 was your cabin pressurised ?  
 and don &apos;t get me started on the way that people from tulsa talk .  
okay .   
what &apos;s with the word y &apos;all ?  you know ,  just .  .  .  two words just .  .  .  pushed together .  .  .  are we all allowed to do that ,  because if so ,  i say why stop there ?  you know ,  your new poodle could be your noodle .  and fried chicken ?  could be fricken . waiter ,  waiter excuse me ,  i &apos;ll have the fricken ?   see ,  that &apos;s .  .  .  that &apos;s funny with the fricken ,  right ?  
no ,  it just remind me of something this guy did today at work .  i told you about that funny guy ,  geoffrey ,  right ?  
yeah ,  he came up .  .  .  
well ,  he did this bit .  .  .  you probably had to be there ,  but it was liza minelli locked in our freezer ,  eating a raw chicken .   
 were you there ?  
i really do understand how hard it &apos;s gotta be to leave your child with another person .  i mean ,  it &apos;s leaving behind a piece of your heart .  .  .   
sandy ,  that &apos;s exactly what it is .  .  .  
are you gay ?   
ross !  
it &apos;s okay .  i get that a lot doing what i do .  but i am straight .  i - i &apos;m engaged actually .  
oh !  
her name is deliah .  
oh ,  that &apos;s pretty .  
 so you &apos;re just like a .  .  .  guy who &apos;s a nanny ?  
i realise how it &apos;s .  .  .  a bit unorthodox for some people ,  but i really believe ,  the most satisfying thing you can do with your life ,  is take care of a child .  
 okay .  
like in my last job ,  i met daniel when he was three weeks old .  and i was his name for me .  .  .  i &apos;ll see you every day .  .  .  right in .  .  .   
yeah ,  kids say all kinds of crap .   
oh god ,  she mu .  .  .  she must need her diaper changed .  
oh ,  oh ,  i can do it for her ,  if you want .  .  .  
oh ,  that would be great !   i love him ,  i love him ,  i love him .  .  .  
oh ,  come on ,  rach ,  he &apos;s a guy !  
so wh .  .  ?  he &apos;s smart ,  he &apos;s qualified .  give me one good reason we shouldn &apos;t try him out .  
because ,  it &apos;s weird !  
why ?  
what kind of job is that for a man ?  a nanny ?  i - it &apos;s like if a woman wanted to be .  .  .  
 yes ?  
king ?  
i er .  .  .  i hope you don &apos;t mind .  i used some of my home - made lotion on emma .  it &apos;s a mixture of calendula and honey cream .  it &apos;ll dry that rash right up .  plus .  .  .  it keeps the hands young .  .  .   
 please ?   yes !  sandy you &apos;re hired .  
that &apos;s great !   i &apos;m sorry .  it &apos;s just .  .  .  such an emotional thing when you &apos;re welcomed into a new family .  .  .  
oooh .  .  .  ***i really can &apos;t hear what she says*** come here .  
hey !   i need you to set me up for a joke .  later ,  when monica is around ,  i need you to ask me about fire trucks .  
ooh .  i - i don &apos;t know chan .  i &apos;m not so good with remembering lines .  
 well ,  thank god your livelihood doesn &apos;t depend on it .  
i know ,  right ?   wh .  .  .  wh .  .  .  why are we doing this ?  
monica says that her maitre d .  is the funniest guy she &apos;s ever met .  
seriously ?  she actually said that ?  
yes !  am i crazy to be this upset ?  
nooooo !  being funny is your thing !

what is it .  .  .  ?   please .  .  .  ?   
you know ,  i &apos;m just not uhm .  .  .  that comfortable with a guy who &apos;s as sensitive as you .  
that &apos;s fair .  .  .  although ,  can i ask .  .  .  why do you think that is ?  
why .  .  .  i .  .  .  i don &apos;t know .   uhm .  .  .  errrr .  .  .  maybe .  .  .  maybe because of my father ?  
hmmm .  .  .   
i mean ,  uhm .  .  .  you know when i was growing up he was kind of a tough guy .  .  .  you know a - a - and as a kid i wasn &apos;t the athlete i am now .  
 huh ha ha !  
i play squash .  .  .  !  anyway ,  uhm .  .  .  i uhm .  .  .  i always get the feeling he thought i was too sensitive .  
that must have been hard .  
it was hard .  .  .  i remember .  .  .  i was in my bedroom .  .  .  playing with my dinosaurs .  .  .  playing and learning .  .  .  and my father walks in and says .  .  .  he says .  .  .   &quot; what are you doing with those things ?  what &apos;s wrong with you ,  why aren &apos;t you .  .  .  why aren &apos;t you outside playing like a .  .  .  like a real boy ?

joey ,  i think you should consider something a little less risky .  i mean ,  i think in this market ,  real estate is your best investment . the fed .  just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible .   that &apos;s right ,  i know some stuff !

okay .  .  .  aahhh .  .  .  please laugh for mommy .  .  .  please ?  please laugh for mommy .  .  .   not funny huh ?  oh so ,  is it .  .  .  only offensive novelty rap ?  or maybe just ,  you know ,  rap in general ?   &apos;cause mommy can rap .  .  .   my name is mommy and i &apos;m here to say  /  that all the babies are .  .  .  oh ,  i can &apos;t rap .  .  .  allright sweetheart .  .  .  this is only because i love you so much ,  and i know that you &apos;re not gonna tell anybody .  .  .   i like .  .  .  big butts and i cannot lie .  .  .   /  you other brothers can &apos;t deny .  .  .   /  when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face .  .  .   yes !  yes !  yes !  yes !  oohhhhh !  oh !   i like big butts and i cannot lie .  .  .   /  you other brothers can &apos;t deny .  .  .  oh emma you &apos;re laughing !  oh you are ,  you really do like big butts ,  don &apos;t you .  oh you beautiful little weirdo .  .  .   
hey !  
oh you missed it .  she was laughing .  oh it was amazing .  it was amazing .  it was the most beautiful ,  beautiful sound that .  .  .  
oh i know ,  isn &apos;t it ?  ooh .  .  .  what &apos;d you do to get her to laugh ?  
oh !  you know ,  i just .  .  .  couple of things i tried  .  .  .  i just sang a little doo .  .  .  itsy bitsy spider .  .  .  
you sang baby got back didn &apos;t you ?  
 .  .  . and then it goes back to the chorus .  .  .  smelly cat ,  sme - lly ca - t  /  i - t &apos;s not your fau - lt .  and that &apos;s the end of the song .  .  .  i realise that you didn &apos;t ask to hear it ,  but uhm .  .  .  no - one had spoken in seventeen minutes .  
phoebe writes lots of great songs .  wha .  .  .  what was that one you sang the other night that everybody just loved ?  
oh ,  pervert parade ?  
 no .  .  .  
oh ,  ode to a pubic hair ?  
stop !   
oh god !  is that veal ?  
mom ,  i thought i told you .  .  .  phoebe &apos;s a vegetarian .  
oh !  
oh no ,  no ,  no ,  no .  .  .  that &apos;s okay ,  that &apos;s okay .  .  .  i mean ,  i &apos;m .  .  .  i am a vegetarian .  .  .  except for veal .  .  .  yeah no ,  veal i love .  .  .  
phoebe you don &apos;t have to eat .  .  .  
no ,  no ,  no ,  i actually it &apos;s any baby animals babies .  .  .  you know .  .  .  especially veal .  .  .  and this ,  this nice vein of fat running through it .  .  .   hmmm .  .  .  yummy  hmmm .  .  .   
so you stole that tape from richard &apos;s apartment ?  
whoho ho .  .  .  listen to the judgement from the porn star !  
that tape was never meant to be seen by .  .  .   joey i would feel more comfortable if i was having this conversation in private .  
 monica ,  look .  .  .  i don &apos;t think you and i have any secrets anymore .  .  .   not ready to joke about it yet ,  okay ,  i see you later .   
why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it ?  
because that &apos;s who i am ,  okay ?  i &apos;m sure a mature man like richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn &apos;t bother him .  just &apos;d be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men &apos;s club over brandy and moustaches .  
is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache ?  
this is about you and richard .  he &apos;s clearly not over you .  he keeps a tape so he can .  .  .  look at it whenever he wants .  
isn &apos;t that sad ?  i mean ,  can you see how pathetic that is ?  you shouldn &apos;t be jealous .  you should feel bad for him .  
oh ,  yeah ,  well ,  poor richard .  y &apos; .  .  .  i can grow a moustache !  
chandler ,  this is not our problem .  we &apos;ve got each other .  that &apos;s all that matters .  
yeah ,  oh ,  but i just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air .  .  .  
cowboy boots ?  i &apos;ve never worn cowboy boots in my whole life !   
oh ,  good ,  good .  play more ,   &apos;cause i wanna see how it ends .  
that &apos;s not me !  
what .  .  .  ?  that &apos;s not you !  life is good again !  ride  &apos;em cowgirl !  
that bastard taped over me !   
is that a problem ?  
i can &apos;t imagine what he sees in her .  
she actually makes me miss that pill - popping ex - wife of his .   oh ,  hello dear .  .  .  
hey ,  what &apos;s going on ?  
we were just chit - chatting .  how &apos;s your friend ?  
a little better .  
by the way ,  do you know who &apos;s moving back into town ?  tom and sue &apos;s daughter jen .  
you remember her michael ,  she &apos;s lovely and .  .  .  well behaved and .  .  .  single .  
i &apos;m not interested .  
oh ,  please darling ,  let &apos;s be honest .  you can have all the .  .  .  sailor fun you want with that one ,  but .  .  .  let &apos;s be real .  .  .  
all right ,  stop !  you know ,  all phoebe has done tonight is trying to get you to like her .  and maybe that hasn &apos;t been clear all the time ,  but she did her best .  and yeah .  .  .  she &apos;s a little different than you are .  .  .  
michael ,  a pimp spit in her mouth !   
so what ?  i mean if even i can get past that ,  it shouldn &apos;t bother you .  and you don &apos;t have to like her .  you just have to accept the fact that i do .  i mean ,  if you even can &apos;t be civil to the woman i love .  .  .  
the woman you what ?   
yeah .  .  .  the woman you what ?  
the woman i love .  .  .   i love you .  .  .  which is probably something i shouldn &apos;t say for the first time in front of my parents .  .  .  and tom and sue .  .  . who are by the way the most sinfully boring i &apos;ve ever met in my life .  .  .  
i love you too .  .  .  
you do ?  
yeah .  .  .  !  how great is this .  .  .  ?   
wanna get out of here ?  
okay .  
mom ,  dad ,  thanks for dinner .

hey hon ?  would you help me get the plates down ?  
yeah .  hey !  here &apos;s an idea .  why don &apos;t we use our wedding china today ?  
no ,  i think we should save our china for something really special .  .  . like ,  if the queen of england comes over .  
honey ,  she keeps cancelling on us .  .  . take the hint !  
what if something gets broken ?  they &apos;re so expensive !  
what is the point of having them ,  if we never use them ?  
ok .  . but if something gets broken ,  and then the queen comes over .  .  .  
i will explain it to her .  
oh yeah !  like i &apos;m going to let you talk to the queen .

my boyfriend cancelled on me .  i mean i ,  i finally find a real relationship someone that i can spend this day with ,  and then his wife comes back into town .  i swear ,  it &apos;s ,  it &apos;s ,  not even worth dating married guys .

i was so looking forward to this .  it was going to be such a beautiful thanksgiving .  we were going to have sushi .  .  .  
oh amy .  .  . don &apos;t cry .  erm .  ross ?  could i talk to you in private ?  
sure you wanna go upstairs ?  or .  .  .   
erm look .  i was thinking ,  if it &apos;s ok with monica ,  i would like to invite amy ,  to thanksgiving .  
you know i think that &apos;s a great idea .  it &apos;ll be like the pilgrims being in the indian &apos;s syphillis .  
look ,  i know she &apos;s a little tough to take .  .  . but she has no where else to go .  and she &apos;s my sister .  alright ?  and she &apos;s emma &apos;s aunt ?  and i &apos;d like them to bond .  .  .  
ok .  .  . fine .  but i don &apos;t want them bonding too much .  i don &apos;t want her telling emma she needs a nose job .  
well !  ross ,  you know what ?  she may need one we &apos;re just going to have to make our peace with that .   
hi !  !  
hey you guys !  this is my sister amy .  .  . this is chandler ,  joey ,  phoebe and you know mon !  
oh my god !  you &apos;re on days of our lives !

wow !  they must put alot of make - up on you .  away as chandler pats his back . ] 
hi .   
yeah ,  i thi ,  think so .   it &apos;s nice to meet you emma .  .  
ooo !  that &apos;s a funny noise !   
phoebs !  i still need some help here .  
oh !  right ok .  erm .  .  . ok .  . so it &apos;s not just the lie you tell ,  but it &apos;s the way you tell it for example ,  if you look down on the ground when you &apos;re talking ,  people know you &apos;re lying .  
oh .  .  . i don &apos;t know why this is so hard for me .  .  . y &apos;know what i mean ?  lying is basically just acting ,  and i am a terrific actor !  
you are a  terrific actor !  
hey !  where &apos;s the baby ?  
oh we just put her down for a nap .  
listen ,  i was just thinking .  you know what would be incredible ?  if you guys died !  
thank you amy !  
no ,  no ,  then i would get the baby !  i mean you know ,  it &apos;d be just like a movie ,  like at first i wouldn &apos;t know what to do with her ,  then i would rise to the occasion ,  and then i get a make - over and then i get married ?  
that &apos;s a great movie !   
now listen ,  not that you guys could stop me or anything ,  cos you know ,  you &apos;d be dead .  but ,  i was thinking about changing her name .  .  . i &apos;m just not really a big fan of emily .  
emma .  
phoe - be !   
honey ,  i don &apos;t know how to tell you this but ,  erm .  .  . but if something were to happen to ross or myself .  .  . erm .  .  . you wouldn &apos;t get the baby .  
well ,  who would ?  
well ,  we haven &apos;t officially asked them yet ,  but ,  we would want monica and chandler .  
i can &apos;t believe you want us to raise emma !  
yeah ,  oh my god .  . i &apos;m so moved .  
i don &apos;t believe this .  hold on a second .  you guys die .  .  . and i don &apos;t get your baby ?  ?  ?  
amy ,  see ,  we &apos;re alot closer to monica and chandler .  we see them everyday ,  and truthfully ,  honey ,  you don &apos;t seem very connected to the baby .  
connected ?  i mean .  .  . to what ?  she &apos;s a lump !  
you know guys ,  i gotta say this ,  this means so much to me .  that you &apos;d trust me ,  with your child .  .  . i mean ,  we all know that monica and i have been trying to have a baby of our own ,  and i &apos;ve had my doubts about my skills as a father ,  but .  .  . that you two .  .  .  . that you two .  .  .  
this guy ?  seriously ?    
ok .  .  . it &apos;s time for dinner !  erm .  .  . everyone ,  we &apos;re using our fancy china ,  and erm ,  it &apos;s very expensive .  .  . so pleaaase be careful .   
whoa .  .  .  .  . whoa .  .  .  .  .  .  whoa !  
ok er .  .  . just to be clear ,  comedy with the plates ,  will not be well - received .    
hey !  !  how come my plate is less fancy than everyone elses ?  do you not trust me with the fancy plate ?  
no !  !  !  honey that &apos;s .  .  . that &apos;s a special plate !  see ,  it &apos;s a game !  whoever gets that plate ,  wins !  
y &apos;know ,  this is such a slap in the face .  i mean ,  i &apos;m your sister ,  and you &apos;d give your baby to these .  .  .  . strangers over me .  
monica ,  is ross &apos; sister .  
no .  .  .  . ross &apos; sister was really fat .  
that was me .  
er .  .  . no .  she was this really dorky girl in high school ,  who used to follow rachel around like a puppy .  .  .  
amy !  !  you &apos;ve got to stop doing that .   
ok .  .  . listen er .  .  . i know that you &apos;re having a little bit of a family crisis but you don &apos;t have to take it out on the plates !  in fact i think ,  that ,  everyone ,  should erm .  .  . cut their food like this !   now ,  see ?  this way you protect the plates ,  and let &apos;s face it .  you have fun .  
ok ,  how bout this .  if you guys die ,  and the crazy plate lady dies .  .  . then do i get the baby .  
no .  .  . if crazy plate lady .  .  .  if monica dies .  .  . then .  .  . i would get emma .  .  . right ?  
well ,  actually .  .  .  .  
actually what ?  
er .  .  . it &apos;s just that in that case .  .  . then erm .  .  . emma would go to my parents .  
what ?  ?  !  
hurts doesn &apos;t it ?   
er .  .  .  who has to die for me to get her ?   
so ,  if monica &apos;s not around ,  i &apos;m not good enough to raise emma ?  
no ,  that &apos;s not what we are saying .  .  .  
yeah !  he &apos;s lying he looked down !   
what .  .  . what is wrong with me ?  am i ,  am i incompetent ?  because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you !  
honey ,  you &apos;re taking this the wrong way .  we think you &apos;re going to be a wonderful parent !  it &apos;s just that ,  you &apos;re more the .  .  . y &apos;know ,  fun parent .  
yeah !  and we wanna make sure that emma also has someone like monica ,  who &apos;s more of a disciplinarian .  .  . someone who can be firm ,  and strict .  
that &apos;s not how you see me is it ?  
no ,  you &apos;re all about the fun .   
look ,  i may not know alot about babies ,  but you really think i &apos;m not capable ?  
no .  .  . you both are equally capable .  it &apos;s just that you &apos;re strongest ,  when you &apos;re together .  
ok ,  so if we both had emma ,  and i die  she &apos;d have to give her up .  
sure !  monica would have to give her up .  
i lie better than that right ?   
so .  .  . so let me get this straight .  so my two friends die ,  i get emma ,  then my wife dies ,  then emma the one - tiny - ray - of - hope left in my life ,  gets taken away from me ?  
hey .  .  . there you are .  you disappeared after dinner .  
oh ,  did somebody miss me ?  is there a child to raise poorly ?  
ross and rachel don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about !  i mean it &apos;s not like they &apos;re so responsible .  emma as a product of a bottle of murlo and a five - year - old condom .  
y &apos;know but they &apos;re right .  i &apos;m not a strong father - figure and i never will be .  
no .  .  .  . you learn these things .  you grow into it .  
yeah ,  but it &apos;s not who i am .  everything they said is exactly why i was worried about having a kid .  and it &apos;s true !  and ,  look ,  everybody knows it .  
i don &apos;t know it !  i want to have a kid with you because i think you &apos;re going to be an amazing dad .  at the fun parts and at the hard parts .  
oh yeah ,  well ,  can you picture me saying ,   &quot; go to your room !  you &apos;re grounded !  &quot;  
can you hear me say you &apos;re grounded ?  
you said that to me last week .  
how hard is it ?  no shoes on the furniture !   
argh .  the producer from days of our life left me a message on the machine asking why i wasn &apos;t at the parade !  they say everybody is very pissed off at me and they all got to meet santa !   
it &apos;s ok .  i thought of the perfect lie for you .  it &apos;s easy to remember and it doesn &apos;t invite alot of questions .  you weren &apos;t at the parade ,  because you had a family emergency .  
oh .  .  . i like that !  yeah !  i wasn &apos;t at the parade because i had a family emergency .  
ooo .  .  . what happened ?  
er .  .  . my sister &apos;s raccoon came .  .  .  .  .   
wha .  .  . wait what are you doing ?  
setting the table .  
i thought it might be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too .  
oh .  . how nice !  maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress 
hey dude ,  you ok ?  sorry bout before .  
no ,  no that &apos;s ok .  you &apos;re totally right i don &apos;t know anything about disciplining a child .  but .  .  . you did hurt my feelings .  .  . so ,  i want you to know that if i die ,  you don &apos;t get joey .    
in case you haven &apos;t noticed ,  i &apos;m not talking to you .   
you know ,  this is .  .  . this is classic rachel .  
oh yeah .  .  . yeah ,  right .  remember in high school ,  when i died ,  and didn &apos;t give you my baby ?  
this ,  might be my one chance to have a child ,  rachel .  i mean ,  you know that i have been so busy focussing on my career .  .  .  
erm .  .  . i &apos;m a decorator ?  ?   
you decorate dad &apos;s office and now you &apos;re a decorator ?  ok !  i went to the zoo yesterday .  .  . now i &apos;m a koala bear !  
why can &apos;t you ever be supportive ?  
suppor .  .  . you wanna talk supportive ?  you didn &apos;t even come and visit me when i was in the hospital having the baby !  
oh yeah ?  well ,  you didn &apos;t come to see me in the hospital when i was getting my lips done !  
i did the first time !   
and .  .  . and you know what ?  you wanna know why i &apos;m not giving emily to you ?  
emma .  
oh !  whoose side are you on !  /  i &apos;m not giving you emma because there is no way ,  you could handle the responsibility of a child .  
well ,  how hard could it be ?  you do it .  
ooooooooohoohooo .  .  .  .  .  .  .  
do i know why you don &apos;t want me to have the baby ?  because you don &apos;t want me to be happy !  you have always been jealous of me .  
jealous of what ?  of your lack of responsibility ?  your .  .  . your inmaturity ?  your total disregard for other people &apos;s feelings ?  
er .  .  . to name a few !   
y &apos;know ,  you &apos;re just ,  you &apos;ve always been like this .  you just .  .  . you had to have everything and i couldn &apos;t have anything .  like in junior high ,  when you stole timmy from me .  .  . i mean do you even realize how much that hurt me ?

whoa - ho ,  back off ,  missy !

so ?  i &apos;m married .   
i &apos;m *happily* married .  
oh .  what &apos;s *that* like ?  
right .  so ,  i &apos;m sorry .  .  .  
seriously ?  happily married .  so that phone call before ,  that was  .  .  .  happy ?  
well look ,  it &apos;s not easy to spend this much time apart ,  you know .  right on money !   .  .  .  you know ,  she &apos;s amazing ,  and beautiful ,  and smart ,  and if she were here right now ,   .  .  . she &apos;d kick your ass .  look ,  you &apos;re a really nice person .  .  .  ham stealing and adultery aside .  but ,  what i have with my wife is pretty great ,  so nothing is ever gonna happen between us .  
i mean ,  you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight !  
really ?  
you kidding ?  you &apos;re the most beautiful woman in most rooms .  .  .   whoa !  whoa !  whoa !  what &apos;s going on ?  you and i just made out !  you and i are making out ?  
well ,  not anymore .  
but we don &apos;t do that .  
i know ,  i just thought it would be fun .  
how drunk are you ?  
drunk enough that i know i wanna do this .  not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage .  
 that &apos;s the perfect amount !  
okay !   
 y &apos;know what &apos;s weird ?  
what ?  
this doesn &apos;t feel weird !  
i know .  
you &apos;re a really good kisser .  
well ,  i have kissed over four women .   do you wanna get under the covers ?  
hm - hmm !  
okay !   
wow !  you are really fast !  
it bodes well for me that speed impresses you .  
we &apos;re gonna see each other naked .  
yep !  
do you wanna do it at the same time ?  
count of three ?  
one !  
two !  
two !  
three !   
well i think it &apos;s safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined .  
eh ,  we weren &apos;t that close anyway !  
so ,  are you really gonna go out with that nurse man ?  
well uh ,  you and i are just goofing around ,  i thought ,  why not just goof around with him .  
y &apos;know ,  i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary .  .  .  well ,  i have ,  and the technical definition is ,  two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together .  but if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me ,  then we have to ,  y &apos;know ,  get you my original dictionary .  i am *so* bad at this .  
i think you &apos;re better than you think you are .  
really ?  okay ,  so .  .  .  
 know when to stop .  
y &apos;know ,  i sensed that i should stop .  so we &apos;re okay ?  
yeah .  (they kiss and as she starts to leave ,  chandler starts 
i can &apos;t get married until i get something old ,  something new ,  something borrowed ,  and something blue .  
okay ,  all right ,  all right ,  all right !  okay !   okay ,  here &apos;s something ,  here &apos;s something blue and new .  
you &apos;re so efficient .  i love you !  
let &apos;s go !   
no - no - no ,  wait !  we need something old !  
oh ,  okay ,  i have condom in my wallet that i &apos;ve had since i was twelve .  
that &apos;ll work !  
i don &apos;t think so .  
okay ,  now we just need something borrowed !  
 here just .  .  . take this .   
that &apos;s stealing !  
no ,  we &apos;ll - we &apos;ll bring it back !  just put it under your dress .   
ohh .   
listen umm ,  i &apos;ve been thinking ,  it &apos;s not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding .  i mean ,  you work ,  you work really hard for that .  
ehh .  
eh ,  you work for that .  
look ,  i thought about it too ,  and i &apos;m sorry .  i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding .  
you do ?  !  
yeah ,  i &apos;m putting my foot down .  yeah look ,  when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy ,  and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy ,  then ,  then that &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do .  
oh ,  you &apos;re so sweet .   oh ,  but wait ,  what about our ,  what about the future and stuff ?  
eh ,  forget about the future and stuff !  so we only have two kids ,  y &apos;know ?  we &apos;ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college .  
you thought about that ?  
yeah .  
how many kids were we gonna have ?  
uh ,  four ,  a boy ,  twin girls and another boy .  
what else did you think about ?  
well ,  stuff like where we &apos;d live ,  y &apos;know ?  like a small place outside the city ,  where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff .  y &apos;know ,  we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door .  of course ,  we &apos;d have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old .  
 y &apos;know what ?  i - i don &apos;t want a big ,  fancy wedding .  
sure you do .  
no ,  i want everything that you just said .  i want a marriage .  
you sure ?  
uh - hmm .  
i love you so much .  
 oohh ,  i love it !  
really ?  you &apos;re not gonna return it ?  
well ,  not  second !

turns out they can &apos;t fire me .  because i quit .  
what ?  
what ,  you ,  you really quit your job ?  
yeah !  it &apos;s a stupid job ,  and i could not stand leaving you .  and why should i be the only one who doesn &apos;t get to do what he *really* wants to do ?  
what do you really want to do ?  
 i have *not* thought this through !  
oh my god !  
i know ,  i ,  i should have talked to you first about it .  
no ,  i think that this is what you wanna do ,  i think it &apos;s great !  
thanks !  
chandler ,  your being here is the best christmas present i could have ever imagined .  
 ahh .  .  .  
now give me my real gift .   
 thank you .  
 here ,  pass these ,  will ya .  .    
oh ,  hey .  .  .   
  &quot; a donation has been made in your name to the new york city ballet .  &quot;   -  -  how did you know ?  
wha .  .  .  are you kidding ?  i can &apos;t return this .  
i .  .  .  thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people .  besides ,  this gift still says i love you guys .  
mine &apos;s is to lilian myers .  
actuary .  .  .  no .  book - keeper .  .  .  no .  topless dancer .  .  .  (he looks down on himself ,  checking ,  then nods satisfied and marks the realized ?  you are the sole wage earner .  *you* are the head of the household .  i don &apos;t do anything  -  i &apos;m a kept man !  
hey !  
good morning ,  tiger !  i &apos;m making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight .  you &apos;re gonna get me good and pregnant .  
i &apos;ve got nowhere to go this morning .  i &apos;m unemployed !  i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna do with my life .  
well ,  i just lost my erection .  
i mean ,  what am i supposed to do with myself ?  
you &apos;re supposed to find your passion in life .  you can be whatever you wanna be now .  it &apos;s exciting .  
but it &apos;s all so overwhelming .  i don &apos;t know where to start .  
hey ,  wait a second .  i can help you with this .  you just need to be organized .  we can make a list of your qualifications ,  and categorize jobs by industry .  there could be folders and files !  
hey !  this is where your hyper - organized - pain - in - the - ass stuff pays off !  
 thank you !  
joey ,  can i have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin ?  
okay .  phoebe thank you .   thank you !  
pheebs ,  have you ever been bitten by a hungry italian ?  
i &apos;m sorry ,  it &apos;s just ,  i &apos;m a little short on cash .  
if you want i could loan you some money ?  
oh no ,  no ,  no .  i learned never to borrow money from friends .  no ,  that &apos;s why richard dreyfuss and i don &apos;t speak anymore .  
oh ,  hey ,  how about this ?  wanna be an extra on my show ?  
you could do that ?  
yeah ,  yeah .  the pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need .  
oh my god ,  i &apos;m gonna be on tv !  
okay ,  now .  i gotta tell you ,  being on tv isn &apos;t as glamorous and exciting as you think .  
oh ,  really ?  
no it is awesome !   
hi guys .  
wow !  hey ,  why are you all dressed up ?  
rachel and i are bringing emma to ralph lauren today to introduce her to everyone .  doesn &apos;t she look cute ?  
she sure does .  why does she have a pink bow taped to her head ?  
well ,  because if one more person says  &quot; what a cute little boy &quot;  i &apos;m gonna whip them with a car antenna !  
 okay ,  i have looked through a bunch of career guides ,  photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision .  
how long was i in there ?  
okay .  let us start with the a &apos;s .  advertising .  
wait .  advertising !  that &apos;s a great idea !  
don &apos;t you want to look through the rest ?  
i don &apos;t think i have to hear the rest .  advertising makes perfect sense .  sorry you had to waste all this time ,  though .  
you call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time ?  ooh ,  now i get to use my shredder !  
i mean ,  i can write slogans .  i mean ,  how hard can it be ,  right ?   &quot; cheese .  it &apos;s milk that you chew .  &quot;   &quot; crackers .  because your cheese needs a buddy .  &quot;   &quot; a grape .  because who can get a water melon in your mouth ?  &quot;  
i got one .   &quot; socks .  because your family &apos;s feet deserve the best .  &quot;  
honey ?  leave it to the pros .  
i actually know someone in advertising .  i grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency .  maybe i can get him to meet you ?  give me the phone .  
 &quot; the phone .  bringing you closer to people .  .  . who have phones .  &quot;  
that went well .  almost everybody knew that she was a girl .  
yeah ,  after you punched that one guy who got it wrong ,  word spread .  
i &apos;m just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff  .   who the hell are you !  ?  
who the hell are you ?  
i &apos;m the hell person whose office this is !  
good one ,  rach .  
i &apos;m gavin mitchell ,  the person who &apos;s taken over your job .  
excuse me ?  
joey ,  look at me !  i &apos;m a nurse !  
yes you are .  i think it may be time for my sponge bath .  sorry ,  i &apos;m just so used to hitting on the extras .  so ,  are you excited about your scene ?  
yeah !  but i &apos;m a little shaky and nervous .  
oh ,  relax .  don &apos;t be .  you &apos;ll be fine ,  you &apos;ll be fine .  they &apos;ll probably just make you stand in the back .  
okay ,  okay ,  okay !   you .  here ,  come here ,  here .  you &apos;re gonna take this tray ,  you &apos;re gonna stay on this yellow mark .  you &apos;re gonna move on  &quot; action !  &quot;  you &apos;re gonna walk over to the operating table .  you &apos;re gonna stop on that blue mark ,  you &apos;re gonna put the tray down .  don &apos;t walk too fast !  but don &apos;t doddle .  
okay ,  now .  what ?  
and .  .  . action !  !   
cut !  cut !  
i &apos;m sorry ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  i &apos;m sorry .  i &apos;m just a little nervous .  
well ,  don &apos;t be .  
okay ,  that helps .  
and .  .  . action !   
cut !  
hey ,  you know what ?  don &apos;t worry ,  pheebs !  it usually takes me three takes too !   alright ,  eight .  
so ,  do you have any other question about advertising ?  
no ,  no .  but let me show you what i can do .   &quot; bagels and donuts .  round food for every mood .  &quot;  
monica warned me you might do that .  i actually think we might have something for you at the agency .  
really ?  that &apos;s great !  
it &apos;s an unpaid internship .  
it &apos;s funny .  when you said  &quot; unpaid &quot;  it sounded like you said  &quot; unpaid .  &quot;  
come on now .  monica has a good job .  and it &apos;s not like you have a family to support .  
actually ,  we &apos;re trying ,  and i don &apos;t think monica &apos;s gonna wanna postpone it .  we &apos;re supposed to have sex tonight .  actually ,  she &apos;s probably at home naked right now .  i tend to keep talking until somebody stops me .  i can just picture her on the bed right now .  
stop !  
wait a minute !  what do you mean ,  you &apos;re taking over my job ?  
well ,  while you were on your baby vacation i was doing your job .  
a vacation ?  my idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw .  
clearly you &apos;ve never been to sandles paradise island .  
alright !  don &apos;t get too comfortable there ,  because i &apos;m back in two weeks !  and i want everything back to the way it was .  i can &apos;t say that i care too much for the way you &apos;ve rearranged my office .  
i can &apos;t say i care too much for that smell you &apos;ve brought in with you .  
excuse me ?  
rach we have a code brown situation .  
can you please ,  please take care of it for me ?  
alright ,  but you have to do one sometime .  
let me just get this straight !  so i go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job ?  
well ,  there was talk of shutting down ralph lauren all together .  
that &apos;s right .  you &apos;re very cheeky for a temp .  
i &apos;m not a temp .  i was transferred here from another department .  
oh yeah ,  what department was that ?  the jerk department ?  
oh ,  they didn &apos;t tell me about your quick wit .  
did they mention that i &apos;m rubber and you &apos;re glue ?  
oh ,  hi mr .  zelner .  us we weren &apos;t sure what we were gonna do .  but then ,  gavin to the rescue .  super gavin !  
that &apos;s great .  so now ,  super gavin ,  when i come back where are you planning on flying off to ?  
well ,  that &apos;s up to mr .  zelner .  i &apos;m sure he will make the right decision .  
 oh ,  wow .  super ass - kissing power .  
today .  
you said two weeks .  
hey .  
hey .  so ,  what did he say ?  
well ,  he can be a little rough around the edges ,  so i &apos;m gonna replace friend doesn &apos;t get her puppy act together ,  i &apos;m gonna fire her mother - puppy ass .  &quot;  
i &apos;m sorry ,  i can &apos;t do this .  i &apos;m not an actor .  
that &apos;s right ,  you &apos;re not .  you &apos;re a nurse .  you &apos;re nurse with tray .  
joey .  
no ,  no .  nurse with tray doesn &apos;t know joey ,  she doesn &apos;t have time for friends .  she gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor ,  because if she doesn &apos;t ,  people die !  
who dies ?  
 man with eye patch !  you get in there and you do your job .  
yes ,  doctor .  
okay .  
okay ,  let &apos;s try this one more time .  
hang in there ,  man with eye patch ,  your tray is coming !  
and .  .  . action !  
 yes ,  i did it !  !  !  i nailed it !  !  !  yay !  what &apos;s next ?  
the rest of the scene .  
listen .  sudden change of plans .  my maternity leave just ended .  they told me that if i didn &apos;t come back today ,  they were gonna fire me .  
what ?  no ,  that &apos;s illegal .  i &apos;m gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won &apos;t even .  .  .  
alright ,  alright .  calm down norma rae .  they didn &apos;t actually say that .  i &apos;m just afraid if i don &apos;t come back right now this guy &apos;s gonna try to squeeze me out .  
what about emma ?  we don &apos;t have a nanny .  
i know .  you know ,  we &apos;re just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight .  can you please just take care of her for today ?  
absolutely .  just give me your breast and we &apos;ll be on our way .  
come on ,  i don &apos;t know what else to do .  
fine ,  fine .   we &apos;ll have fun ,  won &apos;t we ?  yes ,  we will ,  yes we will .   
ross ?  
huh ?  
whatever i decide to do ,  i &apos;m gonna be starting a career from scratch .  it &apos;s gonna be a while before i make a living at it .  maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family .  
so you have to tell monica you don &apos;t want to have a baby right now ?  
yeah .  
 good - bye .  
 okay ,  it &apos;s baby time .  pants off bing .   didn &apos;t see you there geller .  
yeah ,  ross is here so .  .  .  
yeah ,  and i was really hoping that i could hang out .  what do you feel like doing ?  
we &apos;re gonna have sex .  
i don &apos;t feel like having sex .  maybe we can watch a movie or something .  
let me put it this way .  we &apos;re having sex whether you &apos;re here or not .  
alright .  now that i &apos;m back ,  why don &apos;t you just fill me in on what you &apos;ve been up to ?  
well ,  i &apos;ve changed your screensaver from that picture of *nsync .  
hey ,  they were popular when i left !  
also ,  i &apos;ve just been working on this big presentation for tomorrow .  
well ,  i should be involved in that ,  so why don &apos;t you get me up to speed ?  
that &apos;s gonna take weeks .  why don &apos;t just let me take care of the presentation ?  
oh ,  no no no no .  i see what you &apos;re doing here ,  alright ,  listen ,  this is my job buddy .  okay ,  i &apos;ve had it for five years ,  and i know how it works ,  so why don &apos;t you just catch me up !  
fine .  
 oh god .  you &apos;ve totally messed with the back support of my chair .  how do you fix this ?  
hey ,  you &apos;ve been here five years ,  you figure it out .  
hey .  
hey .  
you have a blue tie that would go with this ?  emma spit up on mine .  
oh ,  yeah .  but you have to give it back if i get a job .  of course ,  by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we &apos;ll all be wearing silver jump suits .  
 hi ,  good morning lover .  i gotta say after last night ,  i &apos;m a little weak in the knees .  
here &apos;s an idea .  you walk into a room .  .  . take a quick scan !  
 sorry .   but i kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night .  
oh god ,  i have to tell you something .  you &apos;re not pregnant .  
what are you talking about ?  
that thing that i have to do to make a baby .  i faked it .  
what !  ?  you faked it ?  
joey ,  listen .  i can &apos;t do this ,  it doesn &apos;t make any sense .  yesterday i was a nurse ,  and today i &apos;m a waitress at a cafe ?  
oh ,  sometimes we use the same extras for different parts .  it &apos;s okay .  
well ,  it &apos;s not okay ,  because i gave a very memorable performance as the nurse .  and now suddenly i &apos;m the_waitress ?  that &apos;s gonna confuse my fans .  
maybe you are a nurse ,  but you moonlight as a waitress .  
uhuh .  because i &apos;m a single mother ,  supporting my two children .  
nice .  
wait a minute .  dr .  drake ramoray and i work at the same hospital .  wouldn &apos;t i come over to say hi to him ?  
no ,  no .  see ,  you and drake are having a fight .  
about what ?  
he slept with you and then never called you .  
and i just wanted a new daddy for davy and becky .  
okay ,  okay ,  from the top .  and .  .  . action !  
so ,  i &apos;m surprised you agreed to have lunch with me .  
i &apos;m surprised to ,  but yet here i am .   
cut ,  cut !  what are you doing !  ?  
yeah ,  well ,  i &apos;m very angry at him ,  because he slept with me and never called me back .  
me too !  
 wow ,  you &apos;re here already .  
yes .  emma and i came in a little early to do research on the presentation .  i actually made a few changes ,  but i think i &apos;m caught up on everything .  so ask me anything !  
how do you fix the chair ?  
except that !   oh ,  hello ,  mr .  zelner .  we &apos;re all ready for our presentation this afternoon .  
what ?  i can &apos;t do that !  i have the baby ,  and ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour .  to do it now .  ralph needs to leave early today .  he &apos;s going helicopter shopping .  
well ,  there you go .  you win ,  you win .  you get to do the presentation ,  you &apos;ll knock  &apos;em dead ,  no one will ever remember that i worked here ,  and then ralph will buy his helicopter ,  and super gavin will just fly right along side of him !  
you can do the presentation .  
no ,  i can &apos;t ,  i have a baby .  
i &apos;ll watch her .  
why would you do that ?  
because you &apos;ve worked really hard ,  and it &apos;s your job ,  and you &apos;re a little crazy .  
that &apos;s really nice .  
i should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable .  
then you &apos;re not gonna like what &apos;s coming .   i &apos;m sorry ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  i &apos;m sorry .  thank you ,  thank you .  
please don &apos;t fire my friend .  just let me talk to her .  
okay ,  okay .  but this is her last chance .  
thank you ,  thank you .  how about i do something for you ?  tomorrow ,  i &apos;ll bring you a hat ,  cover up the bald ?  
hey ,  listen pheebs .  i was just talking to the_director ,  and he was thinking ,  maybe this time you don &apos;t hit drake ,  you just wait on the tables ?  
i can &apos;t do that .  i &apos;m an actor .  i have a process .  
you &apos;re a masseuse .  you have a table with a hole in it .  
wait a minute ,  i see what &apos;s happening here .  you &apos;re threatened .  
what ?  
yeah ,  i &apos;m so good in this scene that i &apos;m stealing focus from you .  well ,  rise to the challenge tribianni  &apos;cause i just raised the bar .  come join me up here !  
you faked it ?  you couldn &apos;t have faked it !  
oh yes you can .  you just make the faces and the noises .  
guys can fake it ?  unbelievable .  the one thing that &apos;s ours !  besides ,  why would you fake it when we &apos;re trying to have a baby ?  
that &apos;s actually why .  look ,  i &apos;m starting a whole new career now ,  and i &apos;m not saying that i don &apos;t want to have a baby ,  i &apos;m just saying maybe we could wait a little while .  
like a month ?  
or a year ?  
really ,  you want to wait a year ?  
it could be less than a year .  i mean ,  you &apos;ve heard my stuff .   &quot; pants .  like shorts ,  but longer .  &quot;   it &apos;ll probably be more than a year .  
i really wanna have a baby .  
yeah ,  me too .  look ,  i &apos;ll just get my old job back .  
no ,  i want you to have a job that you love .  not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration .  
i quit and you learn what i do ?  
it &apos;s just ,  i think ,  there &apos;s never gonna be a right time to have a baby .  i mean ,  now you &apos;re unemployed and in a little while you &apos;ll find a new job that &apos;ll keep you really busy .  there &apos;s always gonna be a reason not to do this ,  but i think once the baby comes ,  forget about all those reasons .  
i guess .  it &apos;s always gonna be scary when we have a baby .  
it &apos;s gonna be really scary .  i mean ,  god .  when we have a baby ,  there &apos;s gonna be so much that we &apos;re not able to control .  i mean ,  the apartment &apos;s gonna be a mess ,  i won &apos;t have time to clean it .  what if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer ?  messes up all the ribbons ?  !  what if there &apos;s no room for a ribbon drawer ,  because the baby &apos;s stuff takes up all the space !  ?  where will all the ribbons go !  ?  !  
should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind ?  
yes ,  please !  
oh ,  and i promise ,  i will not fake it this time .  
i know you botched that operation on purpose .  i can &apos;t prove it yet ,  but when i do ,  you &apos;ll be going to jail for murder .  i don &apos;t care if you are my brother .  
i &apos;m not your brother .  
hey 
hey .  so where &apos;s mon ?  
oh ,  she &apos;s at home ,  putting up decorations for rachel &apos;s birthday party tonight .  
and you &apos;re not helping ?

oh ,  wow ,  molly is just great !  
yeah .  
yes ,  bravo on the hot nanny .  
what ?  you really think she &apos;s hot ?  
are you kidding ?  if i wasn &apos;t married she &apos;d be rejecting me right now .  
and joey ?  
how do you think she &apos;s doing ?  
am i the only one who doesn &apos;t think that she &apos;s hot ?  ross ?  
eh ,  i mean ,  i mena she &apos;s not unattractive but hot ?  i  .  .  .  .  
thank you !   
now that rachel &apos;s gone ?  
hey mike ,  what &apos;s the capital of peru ?  
lima .  
no .  it starts with a  &quot; v &quot;  and ends with an  &quot; x &quot;  .  helpfully with a  &quot; to &quot;  in the middle .  
you know ,  kinda think of it ,  the capital of peru is  &quot; vtox &quot;  .   oh god !  oh !  
what ?  
ok ,  i don &apos;t want to freak you out or anything ,  but i think i just saw a rat in your cupboard .  
 oh ,  whew ,  no ,  that &apos;s bob .  
what ,  is he your pet rat ?  
well not so much a pet as ,  you know ,  an occasional visitor who i put food out for ,  you know .  kinda like santa .  except santa doesn &apos;t poop on the plate of cookies .  
you can &apos;t keep a rat in your appartment !  they &apos;re extremely unsanitary ,  and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus .  
what are those ?  
i don &apos;t know but they don &apos;t sound like spa treatments .  you have to get rid of it !  
ok ,  fine ,  if it means that much to you i &apos;ll get rid of bob .  
thank you .  
hello .  
hello 
gavin ,  i just wanted to say thank you again for watching emma yesterday during the presentation .  i really owe you an appology .  
for what ?  
well ,  when we first met ,  you know ,  i thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious  .  .  .  
is this your first appology ?  
no ,  i just mean that ,  you know ,  first impressions don &apos;t mean anything .  and i - i think you &apos;re a really good guy and i &apos;m sorry that i misjudged you .   
good morning !  
hello .   but you know what ,  hey ,  new day ,  new leaf ,  i am just really really happy  .  .  .   i &apos;m sorry ,  obviously heather &apos;s ass has something more important to say so i &apos;ll just wait  &apos;till it &apos;s finished .  
what ?  
i was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out !  
i wasn &apos;t checking her out .  i &apos;m in fashion ,  i was looking at her skirt .  or was it pants ?  i didn &apos;t really see what happened below the ass area .  
oh wow ,  you are really ,  you &apos;re really a creep .  
why do you even care if i was looking at her ?  are you jealous ?  
oh yeah ,  i &apos;m jealous .   &quot; oh gavin ,  please ,  please look at my ass &quot;  .   stop looking at my ass !  i mean ,  i just think you are totally inappropriate ,  ok ?  this is a work environment ,  she &apos;s your subordinate .  
i thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant tag .  
that is totally different for two reasons .  one  -  i didn &apos;t know that you knew that .  and two ,  i wasn &apos;t some creep staring at his ass ,  we had a deap meaningful relationship .  
huh .  what &apos;s tag &apos;s last name ?  
it was  .  .  .   oh my god .  he didn &apos;t have a last name .  it was just  &quot; tag &quot;  .  you know ,  like cher ,  or ,  you know ,  moses .  
but it was a deap meaningful relationship .  
oh ,  you know what  -  my first impression of you was absolutely right .  you are arrogant ,  you are pompous  .  .  .  morgan !  morgan !  tag &apos;s last name was morgan !  huh !  
it was jones .  
man ,  i wish i had a nanny like you .  
you mean ,  when you were a baby .  
sure .   
would you stop staring at her ?  
i wasn &apos;t staring .  i was leering .  
what &apos;s the big deal with her ?  maybe she &apos;s attractive in an obvious kind of way .  
yeah ,  obvious beauty &apos;s the worst .  you know ,  when it &apos;s right there in your face .  me ,  i like to have to work to find someone attractive .  makes me feel like i earned it .  
looks like joey is doing allright with her .  
yeah .  hey ,  that was nice of you guys to back off and let joey get the girl for once .  
 i &apos;m gonna take her back to the appartment .  
ok ,  i &apos;ll be home right after work .  ok ,  by emma - wemma - demma ,  i love you  -  wovyou dovyou  .  .  .  
bye 
they &apos;ve elected me to talk to you about the baby talk  -  it &apos;s not so good .  
i think it &apos;s sweet .   
 hey ,  listen ,  joey ,  about molly ,  i really prefer if you didn &apos;t go after her .  
why not ?  
because it took us months to find a good nanny and i wouldn &apos;t want anything to ,  you know ,  drive her away .  
so ,  what ,  you think i &apos;m just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable ?   yeah ,  sounds about right .  
come on ,  there are plenty of other women out thereok ?  just  -  just forget about her ,  ok ?  just ,  she &apos;s off limits .  
oh ,  man ,  why did have to go and say that for ?  now that you told me i can &apos;t have it makes me want her even more !  
what are you ,  a child ?  
yes !  
joey ,  come on now ,  for me !  please ,  just - just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else .  
fine .   
hey mikey 
hey p 
what are you doing ?  
setting rat traps .  
to kill bob ?  ?  
no ,  no ,  to test his neck strength .  
no ,  mike ,  i don &apos;t want to kill him !  i thought we were just gonna capture him and ,  and you know ,  set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl .  
ok ,  ok ,  i &apos;ll throw away the traps .  
i &apos;ll find bob ,  i &apos;ll get him .  bob ?   bob !  robert !   oh wait ,  i think i hear him .  oh  -  oh my god !  bob had babies !  bob &apos;s a mom !  
better think of a new name for him .  
i don &apos;t know ,  i kinda like bob for a girl .  
i don &apos;t know ,  i mean i &apos;m not sure   .  .  .  
oh my god ,  we killed bob !  
maybe it wasn &apos;t bob ,  maybe it was a mouse .  
whazzup ?  ?  
seriously dude ,  3 years ago .  
listen ,  can you do me a favor ?  i &apos;m gonna be out today .  can you just keep an eye on joey ,  make sure nothing happens between him and molly ?  
you don &apos;t trust him ?  
wh  -  no .  some woman who sounded a lot like joey called earlier and asked for her daughter ,  the  &quot; hot nanny &quot;  .  
is this really your long term plan ,  for me to run interference ?  because i could get a job any day now .  
you do appear right on the cusp of something .  come on man ,  i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll lose interest in a week or two ,  but for now can you please just do this for me ?  
allright ,  fine ,  but don &apos;t blame me if it doesn &apos;t work .  because you know as well as i do that once joey sets his mind on something ,  more often than not ,  he &apos;s going to have sex with it .  
well we gotta do something ,  ok ?  nannies like her don &apos;t grow on trees .   
picturing that tree ?  
where you going ,  joe ?   
for a walk .  
oh .  you mind if i join you ?  
actually ,  that will be long .  you know ,  i really need to organize my thoughts .  
your thoughts ?  plural ?  
allright ,  fine ,  i only have one thought !  it &apos;s about the hot nanny ,  i gotta see her !  
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t let you do that ,  joe .  
now you &apos;re telling me i can &apos;t see her ?  ?  you guys are killing me !  she &apos;s forbidden fruit !  it &apos;s like  .  .  .  like she &apos;s the princess and i &apos;m the stable boy  .  .  .  why are you doing this ,  huh ?  did ross tell you not to let me go over there ?  
yes ,  as a matter of fact he did ,  so i can &apos;t let you go .  
huh .  interesting .  now there are obstacles .  hot nanny and me against the world .  this is the kind of stuff great novels are made of .  
great novels ?  
gavin mitchelle &apos;s office .  
rachel green &apos;s office !  !  give me that phone !   hello ,  this is rachel green ,  how can i help you ?  uh huh  .  .  .  ok then  .  .  .  i &apos;ll pass you back to your son

well i don &apos;t mind ,  i &apos;ll cancel .  i would never miss my secretary &apos;s birthday .   
why did you invite him ?  ?  i can &apos;t stand that guy !

 i still can &apos;t believe you invited gavin .  allright ,  he is the last person i want to see .  
oh ,  you &apos;re welcome for the party .  i &apos;m glad you &apos;re having a good time .  
god ,  i hope he doesn &apos;t show up .  of course he &apos;s not gonna show up ,  the guy hates me .  
does he ?  
what ?  
maybe he &apos;s bothering you so much because he likes you .  it &apos;s like in first grade when skippy langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me ?  
oh ,  monica ,  you think skippy liked you ?  honey ,  all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over .  
 she &apos;s out ,  i &apos;m gonna take her home .  
oh ,  ok ,  thank you .   do you see what all the guys see in her ?  
wouldn &apos;t kick her out of bed .  no more vodka for me !

hey rach ,  somebody got you shoes !  
oh ,  give me !   
be careful ,  be careful !  these are my rat babies !  
yeah .  we have rat babies now .  
ahhhh  ,  you brought rats to my birthday party ?  
so this is what a stroke feels like .  
i had to bring them !  we killed their mother ,  they &apos;re our responsibility now .  you know ,  they require constant care .  you should know that ,  rachel ,  you &apos;re a mother .  
are you comparing my daughter to a rat ?  
no !  seven rats !  i think we should take them home ,  we need feed them .  
whhh wait ,  you &apos;re gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats ?  
well i &apos;m sorry rachel ,  but i &apos;m not like you ,  ok ?  not everyone can afford help .    
where the hell are joey and molly ?  i asked you to watch them .  
 i &apos;m sorry ,  i got a little occupied .  
we have to stop them before something happens !  
so you see ,  molly ,  what people don &apos;t understand is that acting is a discipline .  it takes a lot of hard work .  
so where did you study ?  
oh ,  i didn &apos;t go to college .  
no ,  where did you study acting ?  
molly  .  .  .  people don &apos;t study acting  .  .  .   
molly ,  ah ,  do you mind giving us just a minute ?  
sure ,  i &apos;ll go check on emma .  
thanx .   
 will the stable boy never get the princess ?  ?  
what do you think you &apos;re gonna do ,  have sex with her right here on my couch ?  
no  .  .  .  the leather sticks to my ass .  you know ,  this isn &apos;t fair .  what makes you think that i &apos;m just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off ?  huh ?  can &apos;t you guys open your minds to the possibility that i actally like her ,  and might want something real ?   look ,  the truth is ,  i haven &apos;t felt this way about anyone since rachel ,  ok ?  i didn &apos;t think i could ever love again .   
ok   
hi ,  is molly here ?  
yeah ,  come on in .  molly ?  
 hey !  guys ,  this is tabatha  .   i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .  
ok  .  .  .   well ,  uh ,  joey ,  i guess we have no problem .  
ok ,  ok ,  you start preparing the formula and i start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed .  
hey ,  when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve around their rats ?  
well ,  you know what ,  they &apos;re our responsibility now .  
ok ,  fine ,  these rats are our responsibility .  what happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them ?  
mate ?  they &apos;re all brothers and sisters .  
yeah  -  not such a problem with rats .  no ,  they &apos;re more of a  &quot; love the one you &apos;re with &quot;  kind of animals .  
no .   wh  -  get off your sister !  oh my god ,  what are we gonna do ?  we have 7 rats .  so what if each of them has 7 rats ?  and then each of those have 7 rats ?  that &apos;s like  .  .  .   that &apos;s math i can &apos;t even do !  what are we gonna do ?  
well ,  i know this is gonna sound crazy ,  but ,  we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives .  
yeah ,  ok .  i guess you &apos;re right .  allright ,  so we should just give them away .  but to nice families ,  with children ,  and reduced fat wheat thins .  they &apos;re bob &apos;s favorites .  
it &apos;s gonna be ok .  
you must think i &apos;m crazy .  
no ,  i think you &apos;re sweet .  
hey !  
hi .  thanks for the party ,  honey .  should i help you clean up ?  
no way !  you had your party ,  now i have mine !  is everything alright ?  
yeah ,  i just get a little bummed when my birthday &apos;s over .  
well ,  at least you have one thing to be happy about .  that jerk gavin from your office didn &apos;t show up  .  
mmm hmm .  
yeah ,  hey .   
oh ,  we weren &apos;t talking about you .  no ,  no way to recover .  
no .   
nice party .

 again ,  you &apos;re welcome .  
look ,  i &apos;ll just give you this and go .  
oh ,  you bought me a present !  why ?  
well ,  let me explain how birthday parties usually work .  there are presents ,  and a cake ,  perhaps a fourth or fifth person .  ok ,  i  .  .  .  got you the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier .  
aww .  well ,  ok ,  well that &apos;s very nice .  and you wrote a card  .   &quot; from gavin &quot;  
i really mean it .  
 awww ,  awww ,  it &apos;s beautiful .  
you don &apos;t mind ?   well ,  what do you know ,  it fits !  
see ,  gavin ,  you &apos;re capable of being a nice guy .  why did you give me such a hard time ?  
i &apos;m not sure .  
well monica seems to think it &apos;s because you have feelings for me .  
i do have feelings for you .  
you do ?  
yes ,  i feel that you are a little annoying .  
see ?  why ,  gavin ,  why ?  right when i &apos;m about to change my opinion of you ,  you go and you  .  .  .   and you do that  .  .  .    ending credits 
 first i was afraid ,  i was petrified  
 hey 
 hi 
listen ,  i think i &apos;ve left something here .  
oh ,  well someone left this  .  this is yours ?  
 no ,  but i like it .  i think i left one of my rat babies .  
oh ,  uh ,  well ,  i haven &apos;t seem it but if i do i &apos;ll let you know .  
ohmygod !  rat baby !  rat baby !  rat baby !   
hey !  
yeah !  yeah !  ok !  sure !  look !  can we .  .  . can we talk about what happened here last night ?  
sure !  just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you !  do you believe that who ever did something over here last night did what they did or didn &apos;t do  .  .  . i mean come on !  !  
ok you .  .  . you really don &apos;t know what i am talking about ?  
no !  
ok !  last night after the party i saw rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony .  
our balcony ?  seriously ?  that &apos;s so funny because i told monica we should put lights on our balcony .  and she said  &quot; no ,  no .  it &apos;s too cold ,  nobody will go out there .  &quot;  and i said  &quot; maybe if we put some light out there they will &quot;  
right that &apos;s why i came over to talk about .  hum .  .  . i saw rachel kissing some guy on your balcony ,  even though there were no lights  !  
so are you gonna .  .  . talk to her ?  
why .  .  . why should i ?  i mean if she wants to move on ,  that &apos;s fine !  
you know when  &quot; that &apos;s fine &quot;  sounds true when someone yells it and spits !  
no i &apos;m serious .  i mean she wants to date people ?  fine !  i don &apos;t care but .  .  . at least she could have told me .  you know i .  .  . i &apos;ve been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys she barely knows ,  then so will i  !  very funny !  ross is gay !  ah !  ah !  
no no no .  good .  so you &apos;re moving on ?  do you have any idea where you &apos;re moving ?  
i don &apos;t know .  i mean i have plenty of opportunity .  just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me .  and then the other day on the subway a woman  &quot; accidentally &quot;  sat on my hand .  
dude ,  don &apos;t rub my face in your crazy single life !  
well ,  and how about this ?  there is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter - departmental potluck dinner .  
hey !  let me ask you guys something .  i have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks i should have my eyebrows waxed .  is that weird for a guy ?  
well it depends .  
on .  .  .  ?  
on how far along he &apos;s in the sex change process !  
no i totally disagree .  no i think it &apos;s fine for a guy to do something like that .  such you an actor .  not that you need to ,  your eyebrows are .  .  .  
ok !  stop it you guys !  stop staring !  you &apos;re freaking me out !  
your knuckles are kinda hairy too .  .  .  
oh man !  i have to get those done too ?  !  
wow !  talking about high maintenance 
hey hey !  you dye your hair !  
i &apos;m a woman !  
arghhh !  double standards !  
oh before i forget ,  are you coming to mike &apos;s piano bar tonight ?  
only if i don &apos;t have to get up and sing .  
but everybody sings .  it &apos;s so much fun !  last time this adorable old man got out there ,  forgot all of the words ,  flipped out and everyone booed him off the stage .  so funny .  
it &apos;s just ,  i &apos;m not good at singing .  
oh !  what &apos;s the matter ?  are you scared ?  you &apos;re afraid i &apos;m a better singer ?  you &apos;re afraid i &apos;m gonna beat you at singing ?  
no no ,  it &apos;s not working on me .  wow !  i must be growing up !  
ok fine !  please come and support mike .  you don &apos;t have to sing .  
so i don &apos;t have to sing and i can just sit there and pass judgments on others ?  
while drinking .  .  .  
i &apos;m there !  
hi guys !  listen i really need your help .  i think i did something really stupid .  
well yes rachel but you got something so beautiful out there 
no not that .  i kissed gavin last night .  
oh my god .  
you kissed him ?  
yeah .  it was after the party ,  we were on the balcony and .  .  .  
wait wait wait .  i was at home the whole time .  how did i missed that ?  
it was the end of the party ,  you were probably ironing wrapping paper .  
oh yeah .  .  . so how did you end up kissing ?  
you know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and ,  oh and he gave me this scarf .  .  .  
i thought you hated him ?  
you know honey ,  there is a thin line between love and hate ,  and it turns out that line .  .  . is a scarf !  
so are you thinking of starting up something with this guy ?  
i don &apos;t know .  it &apos;s so complicated .  i work with this guy ,  you know ,  i have the baby ,  and i have ross ,  and i just .  .  . i don &apos;t know what to do and i have to be at the office and see gavin in ten minutes .  
sounds like you need to think about what you want ,  talk to gavin ,  and you definitely should talk to ross 
or .  .  . i could call in sick and not deal with it at all .  .  .  
hey .  i &apos;m here for my eyebrow appointment .  
chandler bing .  will be right with you .  
ok thanks .   .  i touched the stuff 
i &apos;ll take care of it 
thanks .  do you get a lot of guys in here ?  
oh absolutely .  
oh good .  .  .  
are you looking to meet somebody ?  
all right let &apos;s just do this .  
we &apos;ll get to the wax in a minute .  first i want to tweeze some of the strays ,  ok ?  this may sting just a little bit .  .  .  
hey it &apos;s the most eligible man in ny .  how &apos;s the moving on going ?  
not well .  i went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants .  
well maybe you &apos;re going about this the wrong way .  you know i mean think about it .  single white male ,  divorced three times ,  two illegitimate children .  the personal ad writes itself .  .  .  .  
that &apos;s funny .  .  . do you think you &apos;ll ever work again ?  
what are doing ?  you know i can only dish it out !  
i can &apos;t believe rachel just moved on and didn &apos;t say anything to me 
maybe she didn &apos;t move on ,  you know .  .  . maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one - time birthday thing 
no no ,  about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar .  
did she go out with him ?  
no .  when he called ,  i .  .  . i threw the message away .  
ah !  the high road .  .  .  
you know what ?  enough !  enough talking !  i have to get moving !  hey check out those two blondes over there !  hey come with me !  
are you trying to get everybody divorced ?  
you don &apos;t have to do anything .  it will just be easier if it is the two of us ,  like college ,  remember ?  you .  .  . you break the ice with some kind of jokes so that they know you &apos;re the funny one and i swoop in with some interesting conversation ,  so they &apos;ll see that i &apos;m the brilliant ,  brooding ,  sexy one .  .  .  
i thought i had to make the jokes !  
don &apos;t you have to be at work ?  
oh come on !  hello !  hi !  my name is chandler ,  here &apos;s my friend ross right here ,  and we were wondering you know if you &apos;re up for it .  we only need six more people for a human pyramid .  .  . swoop !  !  swoop !  !  
hum .  .  . so .  .  . hum .  .  . oh hey i noticed you were reading the paper .  .  . another would you rather drown or be burnt alive ?  &quot;  
who is it ?  
gavin !  i brought you some soup .  
why ?  
i heard you were sick .  .  .  
oh !  right !  yeah !  hold on ,  i &apos;ll be just clean up in here a little bit !  hello gavin 
i missed you at work today .  how are you feeling ?  
i a not gonna lie to you ,  i &apos;m pretty sick 
oh !  good !  because i was having a totally paranoid moment when i thought you called in sick to avoid me .  
oh no no no 
so i had fun last night 
so did i 
exactly how contagious is this thing you have ?  i mean is it a cold for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you ?  
it &apos;s just a cold 
do you have fever ?  let me see .  hum .  .  .  
what ?  what &apos;s the matter ?  
what &apos;s ross doing to you on that picture ?  
oh he &apos;s dusting me with a fossil brush .  he thought it would be funny .  
right .  right .  ross .  so what &apos;s the deal with you guys ?  i don &apos;t want to get in the middle of anything 
oh you &apos;re not .  you &apos;re not gonna get in the middle of anything ,  don &apos;t worry about ross really ,  really .   oh !  hide !  that &apos;s ross !  hide !  hide !  
yeah !  but you said not to worry about .  .  .  
i lied !  and i &apos;m not sick !  just stay behind the curtain !  
hi !  
oh !  molly !  you &apos;re not ross .  
no i &apos;m here to take emma to your mother &apos;s ,  remember ?  
right ,  right ,  yes !  
don &apos;t panic !  
what ?  
there is a man behind your curtain .  i have a mace in my purse .  
no !  that &apos;s ok !  that &apos;s ok !  that &apos;s ok !  no no no no !  this is my business associate gavin .  he &apos;s just being silly .  gavin come out from behind that curtain !  
hi !  gavin !  please to meet you .  it was my idea to stand there .  
hello !  i just go and get emma .  
ok .  
so hum .  .  . why did i have to hide ?  
i thought it was ross .  
so what if it was ?  i thought there was nothing going on between you two .  .  .  
there isn &apos;t .  there is totally isn &apos;t .  
you hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming out of a chute for the first time .  i used to be a rodeo clown .  
all right .  look .  gavin .  .  . i .  .  . i guess i felt guilty that you were here ,  which i shouldn &apos;t .  you know ross and i are not in any relationship but .  .  . he is the father of my child ,  and you know we do live together and plus there is just so much history .  .  . you know it &apos;s just .  .  . i don &apos;t know ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  i &apos;m just all over the place .  
it &apos;s ok .  i know it &apos;s probably not my place but can i give you a piece of advice ?  
yes 
i think you should talk to ross about all this .  
people keep saying that .  oh i &apos;m sorry gavin 
don &apos;t be .  it &apos;s just bad timing .  
so seriously .  .  . rodeo clown ?  
 &quot; no time for losers ,   &apos;cause we are the champions of the world .  .  .  !  &quot;  thank you !   
oh she &apos;s my girlfriend .  that &apos;s not just how we do it here .  i got to get a break and when we come back we &apos;ve got kenneth singing  &quot; i touch myself &quot;  .  .  . i &apos;m not here to judge !  
hi hi .  .  . oh you have got to sing .  
no i told you i can &apos;t .  
but you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice .  
what have you heard me sing ?  
all the time when you &apos;re cooking .  
what ?  
yeah you &apos;re always singing  &quot; yummy yummy yummy ,  i &apos;ve got love in my tummy &quot;  
yeah i do rock that one .  
ok so isn &apos;t there a little part of you that wants to get up there ?  
just a little but .  .  . it &apos;s just so scary !  i don &apos;t even know what i would sing .  .  .  
well i &apos;ve got a book around .  .  .  
hi !  i could help not notice ,  but that &apos;s an unusual necklace 
you already hit on me an hour ago 
right ,  so that &apos;s a firm  &quot; no &quot;  .  i cannot believe this ,  i just keep striking out .  
i don &apos;t get it neither ,  i mean you &apos;re obviously desperate ,  you &apos;re asking women how they want to be killed 
this is great .  rachel &apos;s gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and i &apos;m gonna die alone .  
by drowning or .  .  .  ?  !  
why would he break up with me ?  
all i ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back .  i mean ,  am i so unlovable ?  
well .  .  .  
all right ,  that was kenneth with his much too literal rendition of  &quot; i touch myself &quot;  .  coming up next we &apos;ve got monica singing  &quot; delta dawn &quot;  .  
wait wait !  i can &apos;t sing in front of all these people .  
just pretend they &apos;re not even here !  it &apos;s ok monica ,  when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won &apos;t see anyone anyway .  
hi !  i &apos;m monica and i &apos;m gonna be singing  &quot; delta dawn &quot;   &quot; delta dawn ,  what &apos;s that flower you have on ?  could it be a faded rose from days gone by ?   .  .  .  &quot;  
can you totally see through her shirt  ?  
like an x - ray .  bad day not to wear a bra .  
hey ,  i need your help .  
wow ,  it seems serious .  what seems to be the problem ,  ashley judd ?  
look ,  i &apos;ll get new headshot taken ,  all right ,  so i want to get my eyebrows shaped 
i am sorry ,  moment to make fun of that ,  please !  
you may be a sissy but i &apos;ll still  .  all right ,  it hurts so bad ,  i could only let her do one eyebrow and now .  .  .  they dont match !  
its like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama !  
all right ,  look ,  you got to help me out ,  ok ?  look ,  i have the magic marker ,  i want you to fill in the skinny one so i dont look stupid for my pictures .  
ok .  first of all ,  this is green !  
what the hell am i supposed to do !  
all right ,  i will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what i am about to tell you .  
what ,  what .  
ok ,  you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage ,  well i earned mine by plucking the eyebrows of my father and his business partners .  
oh my god !  
yeah ,  well ,  i guess you dont need my help victor victoria !  
ok all right ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  i do ,  i do ,  i do ,  i need your help ,  but chandler i dont know if i can take anymore plucking .  it hurts so bad !  
 &quot; take me to the mansion in the sky - y &quot;  .  i am sorry ,  the song is over .  did you see me out there ?  
every little bit of you !  
i cant believe i did this .  i cant believe i &apos;m singing for the people ,  and they liked me !  hey ,  did you hear that one shouting look at those tips !  i mean ,  did i really help you get a lot of tips ?  
sure .  
mon &apos; ,  not that you didnt sound good ,  but .  .  .  
good ?  didnt you hear them .  .  . i was great !  thank you so much for making me do this .  thats is the best gift ever .  
thank you so much for letting me do this .  public bathrooms freak me out ,  i can &apos;t even pee ,  let alone do anything else .  
but ,  whats great is that you dont mind talking about it .  
its so amazing i met you the same day that eric broke up with me ,  because its like you lose a boyfriend ,  you get a boyfriend .  
uh - ah !  
no dont worry ,  this is not some rebound thing .  i am totally over eric .  
 .  good choice ross .  
oh ,  hey !  hi ,  there you are ,  ive been looking for you everywhere !  
oh ,  yeah ,  hello ,  well ,  now ,  here i am .

oh ,  yeah ,  yeah thats michelle .  
who ?  
oh ,  just this woman ive been seeing .  
youve being seeing someone ?  
yeah ,  didnt i mention that ?  yeah ,  i mean ,  we havent being going out for too long ,  but rather there is this amazing connection between us .  i - i mean ,  in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend .  i thought it was a little too soon ,  but it was also ,  you know ,  it was kinda nice .  
what are you taking amoxicillin for ?  
how great is this ?  you are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff .  oh ,  i am sorry michelle ,  thats my roommate ,  rachel .  
hi ,  and i am also emmas mother .  
ah ,  who is emma ?  
i told you about my daughter .  
and done !  
oh my god !  i didnt feel a thing  !  hey ,  are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around that sadistic bitch at the saloon 
thanks .  you wanna see what it looks like ?  
yeah ,  yeah .  hey ,  they totally match !  they look great !  they look great !  how you doing !  
yeah ,  yeah ,  i think it looks pretty good .  i was a little worried i was uncovering a birthmark right about there ,  but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate .  
thank you so much .  
no problem .  
listen thats a pretty girly hour we just spent ,  we should add some manly make up for it .  
yeah .  
ok ,  for my next song i think ill sing something a little more upbeat .  all right ?  oh ,  how about the pointer sisters i am so excited .  and make it bouncy !  
oh youll probably take care of that on your hands .  
i am sorry i am late .  youll understand when youll see joey .  
honey ,  youre just in time ,  im about to sing another song !  
really ?  in front of all this people ?  
and they love me !  
oh my god !  
yes ,  she gives the people what they want .  
all right ,  watch !  
 &quot; tonight &apos;s the night we &apos;re gonna make it happen ,  tonight we &apos;ll put all other things aside .  give in this time and show me some affection .  .  .  &quot;  
are those my wifes nipples ?  
oh ?  isnt that funny ?  i didn &apos;t see that before ,  i wouldn &apos;t have let her go up again .  
i gotta stop this .  
oh ,  who cares ,  they still love me !   &quot; i am so excited .  .  .  &quot;  
wow .  she does that a lot !  
ross ,  you didnt tell me you were a doctor !  
what ,  what ,  wait a minute !  you havent even told her you were a doctor ,  yet ?  how long have you known her ,  like an hour ?  
actually about an hour and a half .  
i told you it wasnt long ,  but there is an amazing connection between us .  
you feel that too ?  oh ,  i thought that was just me !  
are you kidding ?  
hey ,  do you want to go away this weekend ?  
well see .  
ok ,  ross ,  whats going on here ,  are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now ?  
i dont know ,  are we just kissing guys on balconies ?  
how do you know about that ?  
through the magic of sight !  i was here ,  putting our child to sleep .  .  .  
emma .  
when i happened to look through the window and i see you kissing a guy you know ,  for what ?  a week ?  
oh ,  thats what this is all about ?  did you bring her up here to get back at me ?  
no ,  actually ,  see i had to pee ,  cause i cant use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites .  
ok ,  michelle ,  its time to go .  
well ,  call me !  
ok .  
no ,  wait ,  you dont have my phone number !  
you know ,  if its meant to be ,  ill guess it .  bye ,  bye .  
score .  
oh ,  i am sorry ,  did you not like her ,  because i was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on the balcony .  
oh god ,  i cant believe youre making such a big deal about this .  it was one kiss ,  one guy ,  one time !  
oh ,  really !  
yeah .  
oh ,  really !  
oh yeah .  
what about the guy from the bar ?  
what ?  who ?  
the guy you gave your number to .  
whoa ,  how do you know about that ?  
because he called here looking for you .  so dont tell me this .  .  . this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing ,  ok ?  youve been out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now .  and you didnt even have the courtesy to tell me .  
why didnt i get that message ?  
what ?  
from the guy in the bar ,  why didnt i get that message ?  
because i folded it up and put in my pants pocket .  do you .  .  . do you not look there ?  
ross ?  
i never gave it to you .  
why ?  
i dont know .  
oh god .  you know what ?  who you think you are ?  who are you to decide what messages i should or should not get ?  
who am i ?  
yes .  
i am the guy whos taking care of our baby while youre out at bars meeting guys !  
oh my god ,  i cannot believe this .  you know i actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you about us !  but i cant do that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my apartment !  
none of the sane ones wanted to come back with me !  thats not the point .  ok ?  the point is you .  .  . you are the one who moved on and didnt tell anyone !  
oh ,  ross ,  this is just so messed up !  whats wrong with us ?  you know when people hear about our situation they always ask ,  what ,  you live together but youre not a couple ?  and you have a baby ,  isnt that weird ?  and i say no .  you know what ,  its not ,  because it works for us !  but you know this doesnt work .  in fact this is the opposite of working !  
uh ,  clearly .  
and you know ,  we said that we would ,  we would live together as long as this makes sense .  an maybe this ,  you know ,  just doesnt make sense anymore .  
hey !  
hi .  can emma and i live here for a while ?  
ha ,  oh ,  of course .  
thank you .  
your eyebrows look weird .   
morning ,  roomie !  
hey !  you remembered to put clothes on this morning .  
fifth day &apos;s a charm .  
oh ,  joey ,  it &apos;s so great to be back here .  i gotta tell you ,  you &apos;re making it so easy on me and emma .  
hey ,  it &apos;s great having you back .  you know ,  stay as long as you want ,  and when does she stop crying all night ?   
hey ,  you &apos;re not naked !  so hey ,  rach ,  when will we expect to see you tonight ?  
well ,  i &apos;ll probably be back to pick her up around six ,  but she &apos;s in the bedroom all ready to go .  but she did actually fall back to sleep ,  so .  .  .  
she &apos;s probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night .  
bye !   
bye !  hey ,  i hope emma isn &apos;t making it too hard on you .  
no ,  hey ,  it &apos;s been great .  
yeah ?  
yeah .  and look ,  i just want you to know that with rachel staying here and everything ,  all my feelings from before are totally over ,  okay ?  and even if they weren &apos;t ,  when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump .  .  .  
yeah ,  that &apos;ll do it .  
wow !  so ,  how are you ?  
i &apos;m ,  i &apos;m okay .  
really ?  
sure ,  i mean ,  do i wish me and rachel living together would have worked out ?  of course .  you know ,  i &apos;m disappointed ,  but it &apos;s not like it &apos;s a divorce .  
well ,  actually it .  .  .  
no ,  it &apos;s not a divorce ,  it is not a divorce !  anyway ,  i think rachel and i need to ,  you know ,  get on with our lives ,  maybe ,  maybe start seeing other people .  
wow ,  really ?  
yeah ,  sure ,  why not ?  in fact ,  if you know anyone that would be good for me .  .  .  
sure ,  i know lots of girls .  
yeah ?  any names come to mind ?  
hey .  
hey .  i was just gonna get something to eat .  you want something ?  
what you got ?  joey see ,  we got strained peas ,  strained carrots .  .  .  ooh !  strained plums .  we haven &apos;t tried that yet .  
goodie !  thanks .  so ,  how is it living with rachel again ?  i mean ,  apart from the great food .  
i &apos;m fine ,  i &apos;m fine ,  it &apos;s just ,  it &apos;s just weird what &apos;s happening with her and ross .  you know ,  yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody .  
oh my god ,  rachel asked me if i knew anyone for her too .  
why are they doing this ?  
i don &apos;t know .  they &apos;re so perfect for each other; it &apos;s crazy .  
you know what &apos;s crazy ?  these jars .  what is it ,  like two bites in here ?  
i just wish they &apos;d realise they should be together .  
i know ,  i know .  and when they moved back in together ,  i figured y &apos;know ,  that &apos;s where things were headed .  
i know .  they should be a family .  they should get married and have more children .  
yes ,  and they should name one of their kids joey .  i may not have kids; someone &apos;s gotta carry on the family name .  
you know what ?  maybe once they start dating ,  and they see what &apos;s out there ,  they &apos;ll realise how good they are for each other .  
yeah ,  because it is slim pickings .  still in the bedroom .  
so ,  what are we gonna do ?  are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people ?  
i know; that just pushes them further and further apart .  
yeah .   oh ,  i know what we can do .  we could set ross and rachel up on horrible dates ,  so that they &apos;ll realise how good they are together .  
ooh ,  that &apos;s a great plan !  
yeah ,  you know what the best part of it is ?  i get to do my  &quot; plan - laugh .  &quot;    
hey !  
hey !  
you guys aren &apos;t doing anything tonight ,  are you ?  
see ,  now ,  why would you assume that ?  just because we &apos;re married ?  i will have you know that we are very hip ,  happening people .  now ,  if you &apos;ll excuse me ,  i have to get back to reading the obituaries .  
i was just asking  &apos;cause i need someone to watch emma tonight .  
sure ,  we &apos;ll do that .  what are you up to ?  
well ,  phoebe set me up on a date .  
oh my god .  
wow .  
why ?  what &apos;s the big deal ?  
just figured ,   &apos;cause you and ross are .  .  .  
what ,  slept together a year and a half ago ?  yeah ,  i &apos;m all set .  
well ,  i think it &apos;s great that you &apos;re going on a date ,  you know ?  i mean ,  it sounds healthy .  i mean ,  you have needs .  embrace your womanhood !  
you want a job ?  turn off  &quot; oprah ,  &quot;  and send out a resume !  
so i &apos;ll bring her by around seven ?  is that okay ?  
oh ,  it &apos;s perfect .  
ooh ,  joey .  
hey .  
hey .  i &apos;m so excited; i just set up rachel with the worst guy tonight .  
all right !  who is he ?  
well ,  it &apos;s this guy i used to massage .  and by massage ,  i mean hold down so he wouldn &apos;t turn over and flash me .  wait till you hear who i got for ross .  
oh ,  yeah .   
she &apos;s this really boring woman .  she &apos;s a teacher !  
a teacher ?  
yeah ,  yeah ,  she &apos;s really into history and foreign movies .  .  .  and oh ,  oh ,  she loves puzzles .  huh ?  come on ,  who loves puzzles ?  
well ,  ross does .  what .  .  .  you &apos;re  -  you &apos;re ruining the plan !  joey ,  you &apos;ve  -  you &apos;ve fixed him up with his perfect woman !  
oh my god ,  you &apos;re right !  
yeah .  
she even reads for pleasure !  
how do you even know a woman like that ?  
what ?  i &apos;m not allowed to know smart women ?  
joey .  
i met her at the library .  i went in to pee .  
so now what do we do ?  
well ,  okay ,  i &apos;ll  -  i &apos;ll just call her and tell her the date &apos;s cancelled ,  and find him somebody else .  
what if we don &apos;t find him somebody else ?  we &apos;ll just tell her the date &apos;s off ,  but we don &apos;t tell ross ,  and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up !  
ooh .  .  . i hear that &apos;s bad .  
ooh ,  so this is great !  rachel &apos;s gonna have a terrible date ,  ross gets stood up ,  and then they &apos;ll realise how good they have it together .  
ah ,  yes ,  the plan !   
it &apos;s not santa &apos;s plan .  no ,  it &apos;s .  .  .    
yeah ,  you know ,  it &apos;s not that fun .  
emma ?  emma ?  look at me !  well ,  i think i &apos;ll go downstairs for a while .   
no ,  no ,  no ,  no !  no ,  no ,  no ,  no !  it &apos;s okay ,  it &apos;s okay .  i didn &apos;t go .  don &apos;t cry ,  it &apos;s just a bit !  i &apos;m your uncle chandler; funny is all i have !   
okay ,  just so you know ,  i &apos;m gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth ,  so don &apos;t touch yourself in the next 48 hours .  
i don &apos;t do that .   
i &apos;ll try to stop .  wait ,  did you say until the sixth ?  
yeah .  
today is the sixth .  
no ,  it &apos;s not .   
yes ,  it &apos;s also 2003 .  
oh my god .  today &apos;s the sixth ?  !  i may be done ovulating !  i may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant .  
it &apos;s okay .  go take the test and see if we &apos;re okay .  
okay .   
tough crib .  
hey ,  where are all my ovulation - sticks ?  there &apos;s only one here .  
i might have checked to see if i was ovulating a couple times .  
chandler !  
excuse me ,  is there a woman waiting at the bar ?  someone average height ,  dark hair ,  perhaps doing a puzzle ?  
uh ,  there &apos;s a drunk chinese guy .  
well ,  if i &apos;m still here in an hour ,  buy him a drink on me .  
can i get you another glass of wine ?  
nah ,  i don &apos;t know if i should .  i don &apos;t wanna be drunk when i go home alone .  
got stood up ,  huh ?  
yeah ,  it &apos;s no big deal .  it &apos;s just a blind date .  
are you worried your date came ,  saw you ,  and left ?  
we &apos;re okay .  i &apos;m still ovulating .  
oh ,  good ,  because as of four o &apos;clock this afternoon ,  i am not .  
so ,  let &apos;s do this .  
i  -  i don &apos;t think i can .  
come on .  i know you &apos;re not eighteen anymore ,  but give it a minute .  
because of emma .  
oh my god ,  emma .  oh ,  sweetie ,  i forgot you were here .  oh ,  you &apos;re right ,  we can &apos;t do this .  we can &apos;t leave her alone .  
sorry .  
unless .  .  .  maybe we do it here .  i mean ,  how much can she even be aware of at this age ?  
well ,  she &apos;s aware when we leave the room .  she may notice if we start .  .  .  canoodling in it .  
canoodling ?  
well ,  i can &apos;t say  &quot; hump &quot;  or  &quot; screw &quot;  in front of the b - a - b - y .  
i don &apos;t know .  i mean ,  i guess having sex in front of a baby isn &apos;t so .  .  .  
horrifying ?  scarring ?  something people go to jail for ?  
i guess you &apos;re right .  
you guess i &apos;m right ?  when we stayed at that bed and breakfast ,  you wouldn &apos;t have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window .  
wow ,  everything looks so good !  i think i &apos;m gonna have the chicken .  to say this; you &apos;re really beautiful .  
oh ,  well ,  that &apos;s  -  that &apos;s very sweet .  thank you .  
i &apos;m kind of funny looking .  
what ?  
oh ,  come on ,  you &apos;re way out of my league .  everybody in here knows it .  bet that guy over there &apos;s probably saying ,   &quot; ooh ,  why she out with him ?  he must be rich !  &quot;  well ,  i &apos;m not !  you wanna order ?  i &apos;m really excited about that chicken .  
i &apos;m not funny either .  so ,  if you were thinking ,   &quot; well ,  he &apos;s not that good - looking ,  but maybe we &apos;ll have some laughs &quot;  .  .  .  that ain &apos;t gonna happen .  
well ,  come on ,  steve; let &apos;s not rule out nervous laughter .  hey ,  now wait a minute .  phoebe told me that  -  that you owned your own restaurant .  that &apos;s impressive .  
i lost it .  to drugs .   
i silk - screen t - shirts now .  
really ?  what &apos;s that like ?  
it &apos;s really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money .  that &apos;s right .  i have no money ,  i &apos;m not funny ,  i live in a studio apartment with two other guys ,  and i &apos;m pretty sure i &apos;m infertile .  rachel on ,  steve .  there must be something that you like about yourself .  
i do like my hair .  
hello ?   
phoebe ,  it &apos;s me .  i &apos;m going to hunt you down and kill you !  
hey ,  rach !  
this is the worst date ever .  how could you set me up with this creep ?  
you know ,  you are talking about one of my dear ,  dear friends .  
i don &apos;t care !  this guy is a nightmare !  
oh ,  right ,  so he gets a little crazy when he &apos;s stoned .  
he &apos;s not stoned .  
did he go out for a cigarette ?  
yeah ,  four times .  
my dear ,  sweet rach .   rachel is having a miserable time ,  and ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone .  
oh ,  great ,  pretty soon they &apos;ll be back together .  
she &apos;s asleep .  chandler ?   
what are you doing ?  
emma was doing it !  
she &apos;s asleep .

hello ?   
emma ?  hey !  hi !

look; you got stood up ,  who cares ?  we &apos;re gonna show you a good time .  just sit and relax .  in fact ,  let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on the house .

eh ,  okay ,  the waiters have a little pool going .  we have a bet on how long it &apos;ll take before you give up and go home .  
what ?  you  -  you &apos;re making money off my misery ?  
well ,  if you stay till ,  i am .  
well ,  that was weird .  you were loud ,  and i was fast .  
i think we may have really done it this time .  
oh ,  i wish i didn &apos;t have to wait to take a pregnancy test .  
you may wanna get some more of those too .   
where &apos;s emma ?  
oh my god ,  where &apos;s emma ?  where &apos;s emma ?  
don &apos;t ask me ,  i was in there canoodling you !  
okay ,  okay ,  i &apos;m sure that rachel came home early and picked up emma .  you go look across the hall ,  and i &apos;ll call her cell .  
okay .   
hey ,  you better hope that we &apos;re pregnant ,  because one way or another ,  we &apos;re giving a baby back to rachel .  
crying in front of you .  you must think i &apos;m so pathetic .  
no ,  no ,  no ,  i admire a man who can cry .  
really ?   
don &apos;t touch my coat !   
oh ,  sorry ,  it &apos;s my phone .  hello ?  
oh my god ,  this is the worst date ever !   rachel sorry ,  but did you really think that this was going well ?   what &apos;s up ?  
hey ,  did you stop by here ?  
no .  
oh my god ,  then .  .  .   
oh ,  thank god !  emma ,  there you are !  
what ?  what do you mean ,   &quot; there you are &quot;  ?  where was she ?  
oh ,  we were playing  &quot; peek - a - boo .  &quot;  she just  she loves it when i &apos;m dramatic .   monica her ?  
because you two were having sex !  
no ,  we weren &apos;t !  
don &apos;t you lie to me !  i could tell by chandler &apos;s hair .   you are so lazy .  can &apos;t you get on top for once ?  
all right ,  all right ,  we were .  we were trying to make a baby .  monica &apos;s ovulating .  
hey !  it is unacceptable that you two would have sex with emma in the next room .  i &apos;m gonna have to tell rachel about this .   
no ,  no ,  no .  
no ,  please don &apos;t .  please ,  joey .  she will kill us !  
hey ,  i gotta !  unless .  .  .  
unless what ?  
unless you name your firstborn child joey .  
what ?  why ?  
hey ,  i may never have kids ,  and somebody &apos;s gotta carry on my family name .  
your family name is tribbiani .  
well ,  uh .  .  .  
look ,  i think i know the answer to this question ,  but .  .  .  would you like to make love to me ?  
really ,  really not .  
eh ,  it &apos;s just as well .  doesn &apos;t work anyway .  
all right ,  well that &apos;s good to know .  good night ,  steve .   
hey ,  what &apos;s wrong ?  
i just had a rough night .  
oh .  crab cake ?  
eww !  
well ,  what happened ?  
oh ,  well ,  i .  .  . it &apos;s kind of weird talking to you about this ,  but .  .  .  
monica told me you had a blind date .  
yeah .  
i did ,  too .  
oh .  
but is it technically a date if the other person doesn &apos;t show up ?  
oh ,  oh no .  do you think she walked in ,  saw you and left ?  
why does everyone keep saying that ?  
well ,  if it makes you feel any better ,  i wish my date hadn &apos;t shown up .  
that bad ?  
well ,  he makes t - shirts for a living ,  and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this .   
female body inspector ?  what size is that ?   
now ,  wait a minute .  so ,  they &apos;re gonna name their first child joey ?  
uh - huh .  
how  -  how do i get them to name the next one after me ?  
it &apos;s easy ,  you just walk in on them having sex .  
oh ,  so they owe me like ,  three phoebes .   
oh my god !  look ,  it &apos;s ross and rachel .  oh ,  the plan is working .   
don &apos;t ,  don &apos;t do the plan - laugh .   
the first date we &apos;ve had in months ,  and they were both such disasters .  
oh .  huh .  you know ,  it is weird that phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that joey set you up on a date that didn &apos;t even show .  
wait a minute; you don &apos;t think it was intentional ?  i mean ,  that &apos;s just stupid .   
we &apos;re geniuses !  yeah ,  look at them ,  look at them ,  they &apos;re really bonding .  
oh ,  yeah ,  they &apos;re falling in love all over again .   
oh ,  they see us !  oh ,  they ,  they look mad .  oh ,  they figured it out .  they &apos;re coming this way .  run !  
where ?  
can you believe they &apos;re still not here ?  
i know .  a double blind date ,  and we both get stood up .  what are the chances ?  
i know ,  i &apos;m so bummed .  can we have our free crab cakes now ?  
what ?  
we &apos;ve been stood up .   and we want our free crab cakes .  
guys ,  give it a rest .  nobody &apos;s betting on you tonight .  although we do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry .   
 guys ,  guys ,  i &apos;ve got great news !  guess what 
uh ,  ah ,  monica &apos;s pregnant ?  !

actually ,  it pays nothing .  it &apos;s an internship .  
oh ,  that &apos;s cool .  we have interns at  &apos;days of our lives &apos; .  
right .  so ,  it &apos;ll be the same except less sex with you .   
so ,  uh ,  what kinda stuff do you think they &apos;ll have you do there ?  
well ,  it &apos;s a training program ,  but at the end ,  they hire the people they like .  
 that &apos;s great .  
yeah ,  i mean ,  there &apos;s probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink ,  you know ,  grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating  
 humiliating and noble !

so you look like you &apos;re doing really well !  i guess you &apos;re mugging days are behind you ?  
ouh  
 oh my god .  phoebe ,  you used to mug people ?  
hey ,  how did the audition go ?  
well ,  they wanna see me again this afternoon ,  but ,  err ,  well ,  lennart haze did not like me .   
what happened ?  
well ,  he said i wasn &apos;t urgent enough ,  you know ,  and that everything i did was horizontal and i should be more vertical .  oh ,  and he said that i should think less .  
so far so good !   
 honey ,  i &apos;m old !  
 what &apos;s wrong ?  
i am so much older than these other interns .  i can &apos;t compete with them .  
so you &apos;re a little older .  try to look at the positive all this life experience .  
yes ,  but i don &apos;t think life experience with these .   
wooooooooow  it &apos;s like they &apos;re on fire !  
what are they ?   
they &apos;re these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which i can &apos;t do because no self - respecting adult would ever where these .  
 i give you $ 500 for them !  
what am i supposed to do with these ?  
ah ,  come on ,  sneakers are easy .  you wear sneakers all the time .  
well ,  first of all ,  they &apos;re not called  &quot; sneakers &quot;  anymore .  apparently ,  they &apos;re called  &quot; kicks &quot;  or  &quot; skids &quot;  and i think i heard somebody say  &quot; slorps &quot;  .   roll around  &apos;cause ,  apparently ,  walking is too much exercise .  kids ,  kids ,  roll your way to childhood obesity !   would you help me try to sell these ?  
okay ,  have you considered using a girl with huge knockers ?  
no ,  i don &apos;t think that &apos;s the kinda thing they &apos;re looking for .  
hey ,  hey !  
hey ,  you &apos;ll never guess what just happened phoebe and i got mugged !  
you okay ?  !  
 yah ,  because phoebe knew the mugger !  
 how do you know a mugger ?  
i &apos;m sorry i have friends outside the six of us .  
you wanna know how she knew him ?   because phoebe used to mug people .  
 seriously ?  
well ,  i &apos;m not proud of it ,  but ,  you know sometimes when i was living on the street and i needed money for food and stuff i 
 phoebe ,  that is awful !  
well ,  ok ,  i wasn &apos;t rich like you guys ,  ok ,  i didn &apos;t eat gold and have a flying pony i had a hard life ,  my mother was killed by a drug dealer 
you &apos;re mother killed herself !  
she was a drug dealer !  
well ,  anyway ,  it was a good thing phoebe knew the knew him ,  because  i was about to do some serious damage !  
 okay 
well ,  this must &apos;ve brought back some really bad memories for you ,  ross .  
why ?  
well ,  ross was mugged as a kid .  
 you were ?  
yeah ,  it was pretty traumatic .  i was outside st .  marc &apos;s comics you know ,  i - i - i was just there minding my own business ,  you know ,  seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week -  
 wonderwoman !  
anyway ,  i was heading towards this bakery ,  you know ,  to pick up a couple of dozen linzer torts for someone  your money ,  punk !  &quot;  
 oh my god 
i know !  and - and the worst part was they took my backpack which boy &quot;  
oh yeah !  what was his superpower again ?  
a superhuman thirst for knowledge .  
that &apos;s it .  
well ,  i - i better get to class  are there any more of your friends i should look out for on my way ,  phoebe ?  
no actually ,  you might wanna stay away from jane street that &apos;s where stabby joe works .   
okay ,  i think we have a problem here .  
what ?  
well ,  uhm ,  back in my mugging days ,  you know ,  i ,  uhm ,  i worked st .  marc &apos;s comics .  
yeah ?  
well ,  a pipe was my weapon of choice and ,  uhm ,  pre - teen comic book nerds were my meat .  
so ?  
well ,  there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said -  
oh my god !  
you &apos;re late !  
 i know ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  but can i just have a quick second to run to the bathroom ?  
no ,  lennart doesn &apos;t wait !  
but i &apos;m bursting with u - hu !  
 joey !  here we go .  let &apos;s go very quickly !  
actually ,  i really need

 &quot; i could go right now .  &quot;  
 &quot; then go ,  go !  &quot;  
  &quot; i ,  oh ,  i can &apos;t .  i want to ,  but i can &apos;t !  &quot;  
cut !  that was good .   that was very good .  you did everything i asked for .  
 i did ?  
yes .  plus what you &apos;ve got that i don &apos;t know what you &apos;ve got going this squirmy quality that you bring into the character tomorrow for the final callbacks with the *** ,  do all of this what you &apos;ve got going now ,  but  you know what ?   more ,  more .  can you do that ?  
sure ,  yeah .  i don &apos;t have time to say thank you because i really gotta go .   
hey !  
hey !  
what are you doing ?  
putting on the sneakers thought i &apos;d get into a younger mindset ,  you know ,  to see if it sparked anything 
oh ,  anything yet ?  
yes ,  how &apos;s this kicked in the nuts for your feet !   
 hey !  
hey !   
probably wanna know what i &apos;m doing  ?  
no ,  that seems about right .  
yesterday at my audition ,  i really had to pee ,  and apparently ,  having to pee makes me a really good actor .  i got a call - back ,  so i &apos;m drinking everything .  oh ,  by the way ,  that egg nog in our fridge was great !  
joey ,  that was formula .  
we gotta get more of that .   
 you know what these aren &apos;t half - bad !   you should suggest something like these to ralph lauren .  
okay ,  first of all ,  that &apos;s stupid and second of all ,  i &apos;m not allowed to talk to ralph .  
alright  i feel youger already !   
 hey ,  you !  
hey !  
hey ,  how was class ?  
no one ever asked me that ,  what &apos;s wrong ?  
nothing ,  i really wanna know .  
oh  well ,  uhm ,  there was actually a rather lively discussion about the pleistocene 
 alright ,  nothing is worth this .  uhm ,  i have a confession to make uhm ,  okay ,  you know ,  that girl that mugged you when you were a kid 
 wh - what are you talking about ?  it wasn &apos;t a girl .  it was this huge dude .  
you don &apos;t have to lie anymore ,  ross ,  i know that it was a fourteen year - old girl .  
no ,  it wasn &apos;t .  
yes ,  it was .  
no ,  it wasn &apos;t .  you don &apos;t think i would &apos;ve defended myself against a fourteen year - old 
  &quot; gimme your money ,  punk !  &quot;  
 oh my god ,  it was you !  i can &apos;t believe it ,  you you mugged me ?  
 yeah ,  and i &apos;m so ,  so sorry ,  ross ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  but ,  you know ,  if you think about it ,  it &apos;s kinda neat .   i mean ,  well ,  it &apos;s just that i i &apos;ve always felt kinda like an outsider ,  you know ,  the rest of you have these connections that go way back and ,  you know ,  now ,  you and i have have a great one !  
it &apos;s not the best !  
i know ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  please forgive me .  i don &apos;t know what to say 
 there &apos;s nothing you can say .  that was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me .  
really ?  even more humiliating than 
and then ,  at the end of the commercial ,  the girls get out of the hut tub and start making out with each other !  
 that &apos;s interesting !  just one thought mention the shoes .  who &apos;s next ?   chander 
okay  you start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes .  he &apos;s about my age 
 your age ?  
a - huh .  so he &apos;s rolling down the street and he starts to lose control ,  you know maybe he falls maybe hurts himself .  just then ,  a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes .  he jumps over the old guy and laughs ,  
chandler ,  that &apos;s great !  
oh ,  thank you ,  sir or man - who &apos;s - two - years - younger - than - me  
you see ?  that has a clear selling point .  it appeals to our key demographic ,  it &apos;s  .   you did you come up with that ?  
 i don &apos;t know ,  i don &apos; i don &apos; know !  i was just trying to get into a young mindset ,  you know ,  and it just started to flow .  
that is great .  good work !  chandler .  thank you .  
see all of you tomorrow .    
hey ,  ross !   i know you &apos;re still mad at me ,  but can i just talk to you for a second ?  
sure ,  go ahead .  whoops ,  sorry ,  sure ,  go ahead .   
i just really wanted to apologize again and and also show you something i think you &apos;ll find very exciting .   
 oh my god ,  crap from the street ?   
look ,  ross ,  in this box are all the things i got from mugging that i thought were too special to sell or smoke .   anyway ,  i was looking through it and i found  &quot; science boy &quot;   
oh my god .   i never thought i &apos;d see this again .   it &apos;s all here .  what made you save it all these years ?  
i can &apos;t say ,  i just thought it was really good and maybe would be worth something some day .  
you really thought  &quot; science boy &quot;  was worth saving !  
yeah but you should know ,  i also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here .  
still this is amazing oh my god ,  thank you ,  phoebe .  
you &apos;re welcome .  and thank you for  &quot; science boy &quot;  .  i learned a lot from him 
  &quot; i need an answer !  &quot;  
 &quot; i - i - i can &apos;t tell you somethin &apos; i don &apos;t know .  &quot;  
 &quot; you know !  &quot;  
 &quot; i don &apos;t know !  &quot;  
 &quot; i need an answer now !  &quot;  
 &quot; alright ,  here ,  you want an answer the answer is  &quot;   
 oh !  
 &quot; she never loved me ,  she only loved you .  &quot;  
 &quot; you knew this all along and you never told me ?  you never told me ?  i can never forgive you ,  i can never forgive myself ,  i have nothing to live for  bang  end scene !  &quot;  
absolutely amazing !   the part is yours .  
 oh thanks ,  thanks !  now ,  i really have to get 
wow ,  that &apos;s a big cable bill !  huh ,  you don &apos;t have a job ,  but you have no problem ordering porn on a saturday afternoon ?  !   i was in the house !  
 hey ,  uhm ,  phoebe didn &apos;t by any chance mention that 
that she was the huge guy that mugged you ?  yah .  
i see .  you didn &apos;t happen to tell 
did you see our bank statement ?  can this be right ?  
i know .  .  . god .  i haven &apos;t seen my savings take a hit like this since i was a kid and they came up with double - stuffed oreos .  what happened to all our money ?  
i &apos;m not sure what they did ,  but i &apos;m inclined to blame enron .  
i guess with you doing the internship ,  we &apos;re just spending more than we &apos;re bringing in .  
maybe i should quit and get a job that pays .  
oh ,  but you &apos;re finally doing something that you love !  i can &apos;t ask you to give that up .  though it &apos;d be nice if the thing that you love was y &apos;know .  .  .  finding gold .  
you know what ?  you know what ?  i think we &apos;re making too big a deal out of this .  ok ?  so we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things .  and maybe we start eating out of joey &apos;s refrigerator for a change .  you &apos;re chef .  .  .  what can you make out of backing soda and beer ?  
ok worse case scenario is .  .  . we borrow some money from my parents .  
no !  we &apos;re not borrowing money .  
why not ?  
because we don &apos;t do that .  we are bings !  and if there &apos;s one thing my father taught me was .  .  .  well to always knock before going into the pool house .  .  .  but the other thing was never borrow money .  
wow !  i had no idea you had this much pride .  
i &apos;m gonna go .   
why ?  ?  
i haven &apos;t been home in a couple of days and i need to get some more clothes .  
oh .  .  . you don &apos;t have to go ,  i have something that will fit you .  
i put that tube top on as a joke .  
i want you to stay .  
i want to stay too but i &apos;ve gone as bad as much use out of these boxers as i can .  .  
why don &apos;t you turn them inside ou .  .  .  
done it .   i &apos;ll be back in a couple of hours .  
i &apos;ll miss you .  
me too .   you know what ?  i just realised something .  i don &apos;t wanna go home .  
great !  ok .  .  . i &apos;ll go get the tube top .  
no ,  no !  what i mean is ,  i hate going back to my apartment now .  .  .  and partly because i live above a known crack den but .  .  .  mostly because when i &apos;m there ,  it &apos;s just ,  i really miss you .  so .  .  do you want to move in together ?  
wow ,  mike hannigan .  .  . you sure know how to make a girl say  &quot; hell yeah !  &quot;  
so we &apos;re doing it ?  
yeah !  let &apos;s do it !  let &apos;s live together !   oh god ,  we &apos;re really going to move in together !  
yeah !  
hey joey !  
hey !  
listen .  .  . i need to know that what i &apos;m about to ask you ,  will never get back to chandler .   
i &apos;d be lying if i said i haven &apos;t thought about it myself .  chandler is my best friend ,  it would be wrong .  good .  .  .  .  .  . but wrong .  
 ok first of all .  .  . it would be great .  but that &apos;s not what i &apos;m here to talk to you about .  i need to borrow some money .  
aww ,  i don &apos;t know monica y &apos;know .  .  .  erm .  .  .  lending friends money is always a mistake .  
but chandler lent you money !  
and i think he would tell you it was a mistake .

oh .  .  . how much ?  
two thousand dollars ?  
two thousand dollars !  ?  what do you think i am ?  i soap opera star !  ?

oh er .  .  .  well you know emma started crawling ?  i realised that this place ,  is very unsafe for a baby .  so i went to the store and got some stuff to baby - proof the apartment .  
oh .  .  . baby - proofing .  .  .  why is this such a big deal now ?  y &apos;know ,  when i was a kid it was like .  .   &quot; whoops !  joey fell down the stairs !  &quot;  or er .  .   &quot; whoops !  joey electrocuted himself again !  &quot;  huh !  
anyway erm ,  are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff ?  
no .  i was just going to do this myself .   
you &apos;re gonna do it ?  
yeah ,  why ?  you don &apos;t think a woman can do this ?  
oh ,  women can .  you can &apos;t .  
monica .  .  . would you please tell joey that he is a pig ?  
you &apos;re a pig .  and you can &apos;t do this .  
wha !  ?  what !  ?  come on !  i found the hardware store all by myself !  
the hardware store is right down the street .  
hey you guys !  ok ,  we &apos;ve got great news .  
phoebe and i are moving in together .  
i know it &apos;s so exciting !  you know i &apos;ve never lived with a guy before .  
well you know it &apos;s just like living with a girl .  only they don &apos;t steal your makeup .  unless they &apos;re playing  &quot; this is what my sister would look like &quot;   
yeah .  .  .  .  she &apos;s not so cute .  
i &apos;m gonna go to the bathroom .  
okay ,  well you put down the toilet seat .  
yes dear .  
is that a bit you guys do ?  
uh huh .  .  . we &apos;re playing you two .  
we don &apos;t do that !  tell her we don &apos;t do that !  
yes dear .  
i can &apos;t believe you guys are moving in together .  that &apos;s ,  that &apos;s great !  i mean .  .  . i &apos;m happy for you guys .  .  
i hear wedding bells .  
monica slow down !  ok ?  i &apos;m just excited to be living with him .  you know i mean ,  i don &apos;t know ,  can i see someday being married to mike ?  sure !  yeah .  y &apos;know .  . i can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way .  but do i want that house in connecticut .  .  . you know .  . near the good schools where mike and i can send sophie and mike junior .  .  oh my god i do .  
phoebe ,  i had no idea you were so conventional .  
i know !  i guess i am !  oh my god !  load up the volvo i want to be a soccer mom !  
you ready to go ?  
yeah !  you bet roomy !  
don &apos;t you mean .  . groomy ?  
what are you talking about ?  
oh please ,  these guys ,  we haven &apos;t even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns .   
hey joe !  
hey !  
listen er .  . i need to ask you a favor but you can &apos;t tell monica anything about it .  
i thought you didn &apos;t have secrets from monica .  
and that would have made the official party line .   monica and i are having a little financial trouble .  
yeah ,  i know .  
what ?  what do you mean you know ?  
err .  .  .  i just figured it out !  you know ,  i mean you &apos;re not working and the economy is bad .  
oh !  right .  
 that &apos;s the fastest i have ever thought !  
anyway ,  err .  .  .  i need to borrow some money .  
oh !  sure !  how much ?  two thousand dollars ?  
yes !  two thousand dollars exactly !  how do you know that !   
err .  .  . well i .  .  . know how much you used to make and i know how much your rent is .   
oh ok .  
 i am on fire !  do you .  .  .   did you write a cheque to monica for two thousand dollars ?  did monica borrow money from you ?  
err .  .  .  kind of .  
i can &apos;t believe her !  did she tell you we were having money problems ?  
oh no no no no no .  .  .  it wasn &apos;t .  .  .  it wasn &apos;t because of your money problems ,  it was for something for her .  
what ?  
something personal .  
what would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn &apos;t tell me about ?   
excuse me .  
boob job .  
i don &apos;t want her to get a boob job !  that &apos;s crazy !  
well hey ,  i wanna ask you about monica &apos;s little  &quot; groomy &quot;  joke .  
oh !  alright .  well i think the reason people laugh is becuase it &apos;s a play on the word roomy .  
i get the joke .  sophisticated as it was .  now the thing i wanna say is .  .  .  maybe we should have talked about this before .  us living together ,  you &apos;re not expecting a proposal ,  right ?  
oh no !  no no !  not at all .  we &apos;re just moving in right now .  see where it goes .  
yeah well ,  that &apos;s the thing .  for me it &apos;s as far as it can ever go .  
what do you mean ?  
look .  phoebe ,  i - i love you .  very much .  but i never want to get married again .  
oh .  wow .  
it &apos;s just my first marriage was ,  you know such a disaster .  i kind of lost faith in the whole idea .  
was it really that bad ?  
at one point near the end she deliberately defecated .  .  .  .  .  
ok ,  well that &apos;s bad .  but don &apos;t you think it might be different with someone else ?  perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet .  except for once in the ocean .  
look it &apos;s not about who i would marry .  and i was certain the first time i got married it would last forever .  and i was totally wrong !  
but it &apos;s just .  .  .  
look phoebe ,  it &apos;s not about you .  i just never wanna get married again .  
oh !  
i &apos;m sorry .  are you ok with that ?  cause if not .  .  . maybe us moving in together isn &apos;t the best idea .  
no !  i definitely don &apos;t wanna get married .  no i just wanted to make sure you didn &apos;t want to too .  whew !  coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there &apos;s gonna be hell to pay mister !  
trust me ,  i will never .  .  .  
hi !  
so you gave in and decided to call someone ?  
yeah ,  i don &apos;t know who i was kidding .  i can barely use chopsticks .

no no !  i just love the way you look ,  i am warm ,  for your form .  
ok .  . you know the old classics you know , you look nice ?  they &apos;re still ok .  
well yes yes .  .  .  you look nice can mean that your face looks nice .  i want to compliment your body .  i mean .  . i wouldn &apos;t change it .  at all .  and more specifically ,  i wouldn &apos;t want anything to get any bigger .  
okay .  .  .  
i mean ,  you wouldn &apos;t want any part of me to get any bigger would you ?  don &apos;t answer that .   
just when you thought that dude couldn &apos;t get any wierder .  
i know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger ?  
i don &apos;t know !  i mean ,  what brought that on ?  
oh my god .  we &apos;re trying to get pregnant so he &apos;s probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change .  
no you really think that &apos;s what it is ?  
you heard him !   &quot; no bigger !  &quot;   &quot; you &apos;re perfect !  &quot;   &quot; just don &apos;t get any bigger !  &quot;  oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach .  you know what ?  i &apos;m going to have to talk to chandler .

yeah ,  marriage .  .  .  stinks !  i mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving ?  get them married .

no ,  i &apos;m sorry .  look i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what you wanna hear right now but i can &apos;t help it .  i love marriage .  
seriously ?  you divorce - o ?  
if you have to call me name ,  i prefer  &quot; ross the divorcer &quot;  .  it &apos;s just cooler .  look ,  i know my marriage isn &apos;t exactly work out .  but i love to be that committed to another person .  and carol had some good times before she became a lesbian .  .  .  and once afterward .  i &apos;m sorry .  
it &apos;s ok that &apos;s how you feel .  
but come on !  i mean living together will be great !  i mean you guys have so much fun and you love mike .

your ass ?  !  ?  !  ?  
man ,  don &apos;t be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too !  
they .  .  . do that ?  
it &apos;s kind of a package deal !  
god why why would you want to do that to yourself !  ?  
i thought i was something that we both wanted !  
alright look ,  if it means that much to you ,  a may be able to get on more with the big boobs .  but the giant ass and the big clown feet ?  
oh my god chandler !  if you can &apos;t handle this ,  what are you going to be like in the hospital ?  with the blood and the screaming and the little present that &apos;s shooting out of her !  ?  
joey !  why did you tell chandler that monica was getting a boob job ?  
because she is !  
joey ,  chandler knows i borrowed the money .  
mmmm hmm !  for your boob job !  
hey !  what do you guys think about this .   &quot; ross 
better .  
very cool .  
hey pheebs ,  you know i &apos;m i &apos;m really glad you came to talk to me the other day and i hope i was a little helpful .  
oh yeah you were helpful !  yeah ,  no ,  thanks you .  
good ,  good .  yeah coz the more i thought about it ,  the more i realised i don &apos;t think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you .  
what do you mean ?  
well ,  i know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing ?  but is that really you ?  i mean can you honestly picture yourself in a volvo ?  
they are awfully boxy .  .  .  
i don &apos;t know you &apos;d be so bored with marriage .  i mean it &apos;s so .  .  .  normal .  
uh huh .   
hey hey ,  can i help ?  
well !  we er .  . climbed up four flights of stairs ,  manueveored a narrow hallway ,  dodged a rabid pitbul .  .  .  but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky .  
you know sometimes your words .  .  .  they hurt .  
hey uh ,  where do you guys want this ?  
yeah ,  seriously coz this is really heavy .   i mean not for me because i &apos;m only pretending to hold this ,  but for these guys .  
just one last time erm .  .  .  the marriage thing .  .  .  there &apos;s no wiggle room ?  none at all ?  
no but .  .  .  you don &apos;t want to get married either right ?  
right .  except that i do want to get married .  
 couldn &apos;t have this conversation down at the truck huh ?  
you wanna get married ?  
someday .  
aaaaand .  .  .  .  .  .  .  hernia .  
i haven &apos;t exactly had a normal life and i never really felt i was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it &apos;s my turn some of the regular stuff .  
but if you wanna get married why didn &apos;t you say something before ?  
because i just didn &apos;t know how much i wanted it .  and i love you ,  and i wanted to live with you .  
i want to live with you too !  let &apos;s do that !  
but i don &apos;t think i can !  it was ok to move in when i didn &apos;t know what was gonna happen ,  but i can &apos;t move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen .  
can we at least try living together ?  i mean you might change your mind about marriage .  
are you gonna change yours ?  
no .  
me neither .  i think i need to be with someone who wants what i want .  
but i don &apos;t want this to end .  
i don &apos;t want it to end either .  
i can &apos;t believe this is gonna end .  i guess i &apos;ll have my stuff packed up .  
yeah .  
ok .  .  .  so .  .  .  goodbye .  
bye bye mike !  / cya mike !  / bye mike !  / bye bye now !  
i &apos;m so sorry pheebs .

what are you doin &apos; ?  
have you seen this ?  it &apos;s a new alumni website for college !  it &apos;s cool !  you can post messages for people ,  let everyone know what you &apos;re up to .  
great ,  a faster way to tell people that i &apos;m unemployed and childless  .  
it &apos;s actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing .  .  .  remember andrea rich ?  
the tall girl who wouldn &apos;t sleep with you ?  
uh uh .  .  .  well ,  her internet company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident .  .  .  
bet she &apos;d sleep with you now .  .  .  
no .  .  .  i already e - mailed her .  
let me see what you wrote about yourself two kids .  .  .   &quot;   you split with carol because you have different interests ?  .  .  .  i think you split with carol because you &apos;ve one very similar interest !  
you know what ?  i &apos;m gonna finish this later ,  ok ?  let me just grab my coat .  
hey !   
 what do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes ?  ?   
maybe we finish this for him !    &quot; also i cloned a dinosaur in my lab .  she &apos;s now my girlfriend .  i don &apos;t care what society says .  it &apos;s the best sex i &apos;ve ever had &quot;  .  .  .  aaand send !  
 no ,  no ,  no .  .  .  what do .  .  .  you can &apos;t do that to him !  
 alright ,  let &apos;s go !  
dude !   
i think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house !  
hey !  how was basketball ?  
oh ,  it was a lot of fun right up until chandler got a finger in the eye !  
oh ,  no !  who did that ?  
chandler .  .  .  hey .  .  .   rach .  .  .  what &apos;s hugsy doin &apos; in the crib with emma ?   
she was just crawling around and she found him ,  so i just let her sleep with him .  that &apos;s all right ?  isn &apos;t it ?  
 oh ,  yeah .  .  .  of course .  .  .  yeah .  .  .  it &apos;s a stuffed animal .  .  .  you know .  .  .  it &apos;s for kids .  .  .  not for adults .  .  .  i know that !  
joey .  .  .  are you sure ?  i mean ,  i know how much you love him !  
rachel .  .  .  let &apos;s be clear on this ,  ok ?  i do not love hugsy .  i like him a normal amount .  .  .  
all right .  .  .  oh ,  emma loves him !  
hi .  
hey phoebe .  .  .  how you doin &apos; ?  you feelin &apos; better ?  
breaking up sucks !  oh ,  i really miss mike !  
oh ,  i &apos;m so sorry !  
oh god ,  i tried everything to make myself feel better .  i even tried writing a song about it .  .  .  but .  .  .  i can &apos;t think of anything that rhymes with aarrgghh !  !   hey monica ,  i really need your help getting through this .  .  .  
you &apos;re not gonna need my help ?  
well no ,  when i get to the point where .  .  .  you know .  .  .  i &apos;m ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about mike .  .  .  i &apos;m gonna come to you .  
oh good ,   &apos;cause i &apos;ve already thought of 3 .  .  .  4 !  i &apos;ve just thought of a fourth  
ok .  i mean i know i did the right thing .  you know ,  mike never wants to get married and i shouldn &apos;t be in a relationship that has no future .  .  .  but .  .  .  pretty soon i &apos;m gonna miss him so much .  i &apos;m gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that .  
ok ,  you got it !  
 unless .  .  .  maybe it &apos;s too crazy about this .  .  .  alright so .  .  .  you know ,  there is no future .  .  .  but that doesn &apos;t mean we still can &apos;t have fun .  you know what ?  forget what i said .  
really ?  if that &apos;s what you want .  .  .  
that was a test and you just failed .  
damn it !  rookie mistake !   
 i have sex with dinosaurs ?  ?  
i believe i read that somewhere !  
that only is not funny ,  it &apos;s physically impossible !  ok ?  depending on the species i &apos;d have to have a six foot long .  .  .   it &apos;s not funny !  !  
i respectfully disagree .  
i can &apos;t believe you put that on my alumni page !  
who cares ?  nobody reads those things 
you &apos;d better hope not because i just read what you put on your page today .

 hello ?  no ,  he &apos;s not here .  yeah ,  this is his wife .  yeah ,  well ,  it came as quite a shock to me too .  i guess i should have known .  yeah ,  i mean ,  he just kept making me watch moulin rouge .

no ,  no ,  it &apos;s not a girl ,  it &apos;s .  .  .  a brand new hugsy !  
oh that &apos;s so great ,  now emma has two hugsy &apos;s .  
no ,  no ,  emma has one hugsy ,  the new hugsy ,  huh ?  the other hugsy ,  i don &apos;t know ,  i guess i &apos;ll just take it back .  
oh you know what ?  when i was a little girl i had a little pink pony named cotton .  oh i loved her so much ,  i took her everywhere ,  i would braid her tail .  .  .  
make the transfer !   
should i be concerned that a button fell off the old hugsy and i can &apos;t find it ?  
oh ,  no don &apos;t worry about that ,  i swallowed that years ago .   
oh ,  i don &apos;t think she likes the new hugsy .  
but he &apos;s the same .  
yeah ,  i think she wants the old one back .  
but he &apos;s the same .  
joey ,  come on !  
he &apos;s the same !   .  
haha !  
you know ,  it &apos;s a lot less surprising to do that after i &apos;ve buzzed you into the building .  
so phoebe ,  why are there men &apos;s shoes by the door .  
those are my shoes .  
oh ,  when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping .  
monica ,  i really appreciate you checking in on me ,  but i &apos;m actually feeling a lot better .  yeah ,  i just kinda want to be alone right now .   
who &apos;s that ?   
i ordered chinese food .   
what are the chances ?  1 billion chinese people and they send mike !  ?  
 what are you doing here ?  
phoebe called me .  
phoebe !  
i &apos;m sorry ,  i broke down .  .  .  i wanted to see him .  
damnit phoebe !  how did you even call him ?  
there is a speakerphone on the base unit .  .  .  
base unit !  think monica !  think !  
look ,  if i wanna see phoebe and she wants to see .  .  .  
 this doesn &apos;t concern you !  !  
oh !  sorry ,  i guess i was thrown off by the mention of my name !  
look ,  guys ,  you can &apos;t do this ,  it &apos;s just going to make getting over each other ,  that much harder .  
not if nothing happens .  why can &apos;t .  .  .  why can &apos;t we just hang out as friends ?  
sure !  if you &apos;re just gonna hang out as friends ,  then maybe i &apos;ll join ya .  you know ,  i &apos;m your friend  and mike &apos;s friend  .  
sit down .   
oh wow wow wow !  !  make room for your friend !   
 so how &apos;ve you been ?  
i &apos;ve been pretty good !  
 you look really beautiful .  
thanks ,  you look good too .  
oh no no no no .  .  .  this is dangerous territory .  keep it clean !  
so how &apos;s the piano playing going ?  
actually i &apos;ve been playing a lot of love songs lately .  i &apos;ve missed you .  
i &apos;ve missed you too .   
hey ,  ross ,  i just wanted to apologize .  .  .   .  . don &apos;t tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me ?  
uhu uhu ,  check this out .   
huh !  so that &apos;s what i would look like if i worked out .  .  .  and was being serviced by a policeman .  you &apos;re not actually going to send these out are ya ?  
eh .  . actually no ,  i don &apos;t need to because your little  &quot; ross is dead &quot;  joke didn &apos;t work ,  ok ,  there were no responses .  nobody posted anything on the website ,  nobody called my parents ,  so the joke my friend is on you .  nobody called ,  nobody wrote anything ,  nobody cares that i &apos;m dead .   oh my god !  nobody cares that i &apos;m dead !  ?  
no ,  come on ,  you know that &apos;s not true .  
what are you talking about ?  you get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet !  i didn &apos;t get one response !  and i &apos;m dead !  
well ,  the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community .  
i can &apos;t believe this .  not even my geology lab partner ?  and i carried that guy !   
alright look ,  let &apos;s think about this ,  ok ,  do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time ?  that people are gonna post condolences on a website ?  this is not about people not caring that you &apos;re dead  . this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief .  
you &apos;re right .  there isn &apos;t a decent outlet .  
right ,  i mean ,  come on ,  i &apos;m sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service ,  tons of people would come .  
exactly !  !   
ross ,  what &apos;re you .  .  .  what &apos;re you .  .  .  what are you doing ?  you &apos;re having a memorial service for yourself !  ?  
no !  that would be stupid !  you &apos;re having it for me !  
ross ,  don &apos;t press send ,  don &apos;t press se .  .  .   !  
i &apos;m trying to put emma down for a nap ,  have you seen hugsy ?  
original or crappy ?  
original .  
no ,  sorry haven &apos;t seen him .  
then what &apos;s that big lump under your covers ?  
it &apos;s monica ,  ok ?  
that &apos;s not monica !  
alright !  !  fine !  it &apos;s original hugsy !  no ,  now i know that emma wants him but he &apos;s mine and i need him .  .  
 oh god .  
 .  .  .  she &apos;s being unreasonable !  
 joey ,  there is a reason that emma loves that stupid penguin so much  oh don &apos;t cover its ears !   it &apos;s because it reminds her of her uncle joey !  
it does ?  
yeah !  and she &apos;s comforted by him because she loves her uncle joey so much .  
really ?  she .  .  .  she loves me ?  
oh yeah !  but you know what ?  if you need hugsy ,  don &apos;t worry .  emma will totally understand .  i won &apos;t .  .  .  but whatever  .  
ok ,  wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute ,  i mean rach ,  i mean if if .  .  .   .  if hugsy means that much to emma then .  .  .  well she can have him .  
oooh .  .  .  you &apos;re sweet ,  i knew uncle joey would step up .   look emma ,  look who &apos;s baaack !  
look forget it forget it .  .  .  i can &apos;t do it .  
are you gonna .  .  .  you &apos;re going to take hugsy away from a little child ?  
how do you think i got him in the first place ?  
 
alright you two ,  i &apos;m gonna go to the bathroom .  now i don &apos;t want fungus and the idea of me and ross doing it .  
i &apos;ve missed you so much !  no ,  i &apos;m not gonna ask you to get back together because i know we want different things ,  but just to be with you one more night .  
i know ,  i want that too ,  but is that going to make it too hard ?  
it can &apos;t be any harder than this .  .  .  i mean ,  if i had known the last time i saw you would be the last time ,  i .  .  .  i would have stopped to memorize your face ,  the way you move ,  everything about you .  if i had known the last time i kissed you would have been the last time .  .  .  i never would have stopped .  
 kiss him ,  you fool !  !  
what ?  
didn &apos;t you hear that speech ?  if you don &apos;t kiss him then i will !  
oh ,  i missed you so much !   
oh ,  crap !  
who is this ?  
my friend manny .  i asked him to keep me away from you .  
hi ,  that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing for phoebe !  
well ,  you are not doing a very good job !  
excuse me ?  
what &apos;s with the kissing ?  
hey ,  at least i knew where my guy was .  
oh yeah yeah ,  thank god you were here to oversee all the kissing !  
you didn &apos;t hear the speech !  
i &apos;ve heard the speech gonna be the last time he saw her .  .  .   &quot;  
hey ,  it was very moving !  you &apos;re just heartless !  
you &apos;re weak !  
you &apos;re .  .  .  weird !  
your pants are undone !  
oh  !

damn it !  
oh we blew it .  i blame myself .  
it &apos;s been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up !  i tell you ,  when i actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted !   
there you go !  someone came !  
ok ,  ok !  i &apos;m gonna go hide !  oh ,  this is so exciting ,  my first mourner !    
hi ,  glad you could come .

oh yes ,  yes .  .  .  let me .  .  .  take your coat .  
thanks .  .  .  uh .  .  .  i &apos;m so sorry about ross ,  it &apos;s .  .  .  
at least he died doing what he loved .  .  .  watching blimps  
who is he ?  
some guy ,  tom gordon .  
i don &apos;t remember him ,  but then again i touched so many lives .   
so ,  did you know ross well ?  
oh ,  actually i barely knew him .  yeah ,  i came because i heard chandler &apos;s news .  d &apos;you know if he &apos;s seeing anyone ?  
 yes ,  he is .  me .  
what ?  you .  .  .  you .  .  .  oh !  can i ask you a personal question ?  ho - how do you shave your beard so close ?  
 ok tommy ,  that &apos;s enough mourning for you !  here we go ,  bye bye !  !   
 hey ,  listen .  call me .  
ok !   
 i &apos;m dead and no one cares ?  
i look like a man ?  ?  
please ,  one ridiculous problem at a time !  
it isn &apos;t ridiculous ,  look around !  no one &apos;s here !  
you gave them one day &apos;s notice ,  not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and monica .  .  .  it &apos;s probably the way you stand !  
yes ,  you &apos;re right .  still somebody must have seen it .  .  .  i mean ,  i went to that school for 4 years ,  i didn &apos;t have an impact on anyone ?  
oh ,  that &apos;s not true .  you had an impact on me ,  i mean ,  it &apos;s 15 years later and we &apos;re still best friends .  doesn &apos;t that count for something ?  
 yeah .  .  .   oh ,  great .  more party boys for chandler !  
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s somebody for you .  now ,  go hide .    
hi .  i &apos;m here for ross geller &apos;s memorial service .  
kori ?  kori weston ?  
yeah .  .  .  
wow !  you look amazing !  
and you are .  .  .  
chandler ,  chandler bing .  i &apos;m not gay ,  i &apos;m not gay at all .  
you are married though .  
don &apos;t listen to him ,  he &apos;s in a really bad mood !   
i can &apos;t believe that ross is gone .  it is just so sad .  
i didn &apos;t know ross and you were so close .  
we weren &apos;t but we had one class together .  he was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science .  i always remembered him .  
i &apos;m sure that would mean a lot to him .  and if heaven has a door ,  i &apos;m sure he &apos;s pressing his ear up against it and listening intently .  
i thought so many times about calling him and asking him out .  i guess i really missed my chance .  
 but you didn &apos;t !  i &apos;m still alive !  !  kori ,  i know this is a big surprise for you .  it &apos;s a long story but the things you just said really made my day !  i mean ,  the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people !  
you sick freak ,  who does that ?  i can &apos;t believe i had a crush on you !   
monica ,  hey ,  can i borrow the porsche ?  
ok .  
alright !  
but ehm .  .  . what is it not ?  
 a place to entertain my lady friends .  
and what else is it not ?  
 a place to eat spaghetti .  
very good !   what do you need it for anyway ?  
oh well ,  the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don &apos;t sell tickets here in new york ,  so .  .  .  
oh !  so you &apos;re driving up to connecticut ?  
yeah connecticut .  .  . not west virginia .  
hey ,  maybe i &apos;ll drive you up there !  i &apos;d like to buy some tickets myself !  
uh !  
yeah with chandler not getting paid ,  we could really use 300 million dollars .  
yeah ,  because if i was at my old job we &apos;d say 300 million ?  no thank you !  
hey will you get me tickets too ?  
yeah me too .  oh !  i have an idea .  why don &apos;t we all pitch in 50 bucks ,  we &apos;ll pool our money together and then if we win ,  we &apos;ll split it !  
no thanks !  
you don &apos;t wanna win the lottery ?  
uh .  .  . sure i do ,  and i also wanna be king of my own country and find out what happened to amelia earhart .  
still on amelia earhart ?  
the woman just vanished !  
seriously ,  ross ,  you don &apos;t want in on this ?  
no !  do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery ?  i .  .  . i mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times .  
yes but there &apos;s six of us so we &apos;d only have to get struck by lightning 7 times .  
i like those odds !  
seriously you guys ,  i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery ,  i mean that &apos;s such a bunch of boohaki .  
i &apos;ll ask .   boohaki ?  
oh oh ,  we think emma is about to start talking so we &apos;re trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her .  
yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm .  .  . boohaki ,  goshdarnit and brotherpucker .  
how do you know she &apos;s gonna start talking ?  
well when i talk to her i almost feel like she understands what i &apos;m saying .  
kinda like joey .  
god !  look at all these tickets !  it &apos;s so exciting !  you know i haven &apos;t won anything since the sixth grade .  
pie eating contest ?  
oh !  you assume because i was heavy that &apos;s the only way i could win something ?  
no ,  i saw a picture of you covered in blueberries .  
that was a good day !   
they &apos;re towing your car ,  they &apos;re towing your car !  !  
i &apos;m parked in a garage on morton !  
they &apos;re towing a car .  and i am seeing .  .  . spots .  
oh my god ross !  you don &apos;t have emma !  and rachel you don &apos;t have emma !   where &apos;s emma ?  who has emma !  ?  
joey relax !  my mother picked her up two hours ago .  you were there !

i did ?  
she dropped off a casserole ?  
oh yeah !  the casserole lady .  
so ,  did you come by to watch us win the big bucks ?  
yeah ,  uh .  .  .  and then i figured after you win ,  we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it !   
don &apos;t touch the phone !  i &apos;ll get it ,  i &apos;ll get it ,  i &apos;ll get it !  !   
think he washed his hands ?  
hello ?  hey charlie ,  what do you know ?  
what &apos;s going on ?  
chandler is supposed to find out if he &apos;s getting an assistent job at his ad agency .  but out of the 15 interns ,  they are only hiring three .  
ooh !  tough odds !  
yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery !  
look who &apos;s coming around !  
damnit .  alright call me when you know more .  
did you get it ?  
one of the slots got filled .  
by you !  ?

well ,  there &apos;s two spots left right ?  
yeah .  .  . i mean i want this so much !  i mean ,  i wanna get one ,  i want my friend charlie to get one .  .  . except i don &apos;t care about charlie .   
hey you guys !  ok ,  you &apos;re not going to believe this !  i just saw my psychic and she said i was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight !  
hey that reminds me ,  i thought we could use some extra luck so i brought a wishbone home from work .  
a psychic and a wishbone ?  guys !  give someone else a chance !  
alright ,  who wants to do it ?  
oh can i ?  vegetarians never get to do the wishbone .  it &apos;s really not fair either !  you know ,  just because we don &apos;t eat the meat doesn &apos;t mean we don &apos;t like to play with the carcasses !  
ok ,  hey rach ?  
oh no ,  i &apos;m good ,  i don &apos;t wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands .  
i &apos;ll do it !  !  it &apos;ll get the casserole stink off of mine .   
i hope i win !  
well ,  it doesn &apos;t really matter  .  .  .  you &apos;re both wishing for the same thing ,  right ?  
i can &apos;t tell you what i &apos;m wishing for !  else .  .  . you know .  .  . won &apos;t come true !  
right !   .  .  but we  &quot; know &quot;  what you &apos;re wishing for !  
can &apos;t really say !  
i understand ,  but you &apos;re wishing for what we think you &apos;re wishing for ,  aren &apos;t you ?  
i &apos;m not really comfortable with these questions !  
one ,  two ,  three !   
i won ,  hey !  
you know what ,  i &apos;m sure your wish is gonna come true ,  but ,  you guys  -  just in case ,  maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp !   ah !  !  that thing gets hot !  !  
you know ,  ross ,  just keep making your jokes .  how are you gonna feel if we actually do win ?  
uh ,  you &apos;re not gonna win .  
oh ,  i know ,  i know ,  the odds are against us ,  but somebody has to win ,  and it could be us !  and then how you gonna feel ?  you know ,  we &apos;re gonna be all like  &quot; oh everybody ,  let &apos;s take our helicopters up to the cape &quot;  and you &apos;re gonna be all like  &quot; oh ,  i can &apos;t guys ,  i &apos;ll meet you guys up there ,  i gotta gas up the hyundai &quot;  
ok ,  i &apos;ve heard myself on tape and i sound nothing like that .  
i can see the headline now with regret eats own arm &quot;  .  
why would i eat my own arm ?  
well you wouldn &apos;t ,  but we own the paper ,  we can print whatever we want .  
you know what ,  ross ?  i &apos;m gonna throw in 50 bucks for you .  
why ?  
because i know that you think the lottery is  &quot; boohaki &quot;  but we &apos;re all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun .  and you &apos;re my brother ,  and i want you to be a part of this .  
you don &apos;t have to do that ,  i &apos;ll pay for myself .  but just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys  -  that &apos;s so sweet !  come here  
get a room !  
ok ,  so now that you &apos;re in ,  what are you gonna do if we win ?  
i don &apos;t know ,  probably just invest it .  
ooh !  calm down  .  .  .  
seriously ,  that &apos;s your fantasy ?  to invest it ?  
oh ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  did i say  &quot; invest it &quot;  ?  i meant  &quot; be cool and piss it all away &quot;   
ooh ,  ooh ,  i know !  we should pool all own money and buy the knicks !  
i don &apos;t really care about the knicks .  
oh ,  you will when i pick you as starting forward .  
 you would do that ?  i never get picked !  
you know ,  i &apos;m not sure a sports team is the way to go .  
you &apos;re not gonna let me buy the knicks ?  ?  i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re taking this away from me !  
you &apos;re right ,  it has been you dream for over 15 seconds .  
 uh ,  how long until they announce the numbers ,  mommy ?   
 i &apos;ll take this one too  uh  .  .  .  mommy ?  
oh ,  i &apos;ve gotten into the habit of calling rachel  &quot; mommy &quot;  when we &apos;re around emma .  which i now realize we are not  .  .  .  
i &apos;m hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word .  
although if we &apos;re gonna do that ,  we should probably call me  &quot; daddy &quot;  too .  
oooh ,  i like that ,   &quot; daddy &quot;   
i  .  .  .  i was just talking about rachel .  
 oooh ,  is daddy getting angry ?  is daddy gonna spank me ?  
 well that depends  .  .  .  have you been a baaad gi  .  .   no i can &apos;t .   
hello ?  hello ?  oh ,  hey charlie .  did anybody else hear ?   .  .  .  what ?  susan got it ?  ?  how ?  oh man ,  i would have slept with him !  !   .  .  alright ,  bye .   
dude ,  i &apos;m sorry .  but hey ,  there &apos;s one spot left ,  right ?  
well no ,  charlie &apos;s gonna get that .  
hey ,  don &apos;t say that !  you got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job !  
he &apos;s the boss &apos;s son .  
come on ,  lottery !  !   
ooh ,  you guys ,  it starts in like 20 minutes .  
ok ,  here we go .  we need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we &apos;ve won .  so does anybody have any ideas how to organize of 40 ,  and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first .  
ooh ,  i have another idea !  
i &apos;m sorry ,  idea time is over .  
ok ,  well ,  are all the tickets in the bowl ?  
yeah .  
what about the ones you have on the nightstand ?  
there are no tickets on the nightstand !  
yes there are ,  i just saw them a few minutes ago .

chandler ,  sense the tone !  !   
well ,  well ,  well ,  look what mommy found !  !   
ok ,  fine !  !  i bought 20 extra tickets for me and chandler .

i can &apos;t believe this ,  i thought we were all in this together !  
hey ,  you just got in 5 minutes ago !  
3 minutes ago !  !  !  i don &apos;t know why that &apos;s important  .  .  .

when you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic !  
 i &apos;ll show you how .  
ok ,  well monica ,  suppose one of your  &quot; special &quot;  tickets win ?  how are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends ?  
please  .  .  .  if i win the lottery ,  you guys are not gonna leave me .  someone gave me a basket of mini - muffins last week and i couldn &apos;t get rid of you for 3 days !  
chandler ,  would you just tell her what she did was wrong ?  
 she &apos;s right ,  you shouldn &apos;t have bought tickets just for us  .  .  .  
ahhh !   
let me finish  .  .  .   however ,  it doesn &apos;t look like i &apos;m gonna get this job so i can &apos;t afford to have principles ,  so screw you ,  the tickets are ours !  !   
there &apos;s the man i married !  !  
all right ,  believe me . if you win the lottery ,  it &apos;s the last you &apos;re gonna hear from us !  
fine !  don &apos;t be my friends !  i &apos;ll buy new friends !  yeah ,  and then i &apos;ll pay for their plastic surgery so they &apos;d look just like you !  
 oh !  alright ,  you know what ?  that &apos;s it !  i want my share of the tickets  !  
yeah ,  i want my tickets too  !  and i &apos;m buying the knicks !  and steffi graff ,  ah ah !

oh ,  you guys !  we &apos;ve got to keep all the tickets together  
no ,  no !  we should divide them up  and i should get extra because we used my card to buy them !  
hey ,  if anybody gets extra tickets ,  it should be me !  this all thing was my idea !   
oh ,  yeah !  thanks for inventing the lottery !  
ok ,  that &apos;s it !  just give &apos;em to me !  i &apos;ll split them up !   
 oh !  
 ooooohhhhh !

yes ,  but the batteries .  .  .   
thank you ,  thank you very much !  
let &apos;s celebrate with some maple candy !  
no !  
can i ask you a question ?  
yeah .  
have you ever had any weird romantic dreams ?  
let me think .  oh ,  when i was younger i used to dream that i got married to mayor mccheese ,  and on our wedding night i ate his head .  
ok ,  well this is like that .  .  . in no way .  i had a .  .  . i had a dream last night that i wanted to kiss joey .  
wow ,  do you mean like kiss him - kiss him ?  
oh yeah !  i mean ,  that was pretty intense .  
what do you think brought than on ?  
i don &apos;t know !  i mean ,  maybe that &apos;s something to do with the fact that i saw him do a love scene yesterday .  
a love scene ?  with who ?  
olivia .  
olivia ?  i thought she was marrying connor !   oh right ,  real life more important .  
so do you think that my dream means anything ?  
i don &apos;t know .  i mean ,  you saw him do a love scene ,  so maybe you don &apos;t have a thing for joey ,  maybe you have a thing for drake .  
ah !  well it was joey reading drake &apos;s lines in the dream .  .  .  
of course it was !  trust me ,  when it comes to psychology i know what i &apos;m talking about .  i took two psych classes in college .  
you took the same class twice .  
it was hard !   
hey !  
here ,  monica ,  look what i got to wear when i play at the restaurant  uh ,  huh wait !   right ?  i mean ,  this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man .  
oh .  .  . phoebe ?  maybe i wasn &apos;t clear before .  i really love listening to your music here ,  but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place .  
right ,  yeah ,  ok ,  i &apos;ll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault .  
phoebe ,  it &apos;s not what you wear .  it &apos;s sort of your songs .  .  .  i just don &apos;t think you should play at the restaurant anymore .  
oh ,  ok .  fine ,  i &apos;ll just ,  i &apos;ll take the hat back  .   
hey ,  so you guys ,  the funniest thing happened ,  at work .  .  .  
my songs aren &apos;t good enough for your restaurant ?  
ok ,  we &apos;re still on that .  
i didn &apos;t say your songs were not good enough .  
then what &apos;s wrong with them ?  would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food ?  
tiny portions ?  
yeah well ,   &quot; excuse me ,  i ordered the smoked salmon appetizer ,  but  i can &apos;t see it ,  i can &apos;t see it &quot;  !  
phoebe ,  it &apos;s not about quantity .  
well .  .  . it &apos;s not about quality .  
oh really ,  you want to talk about quality ?  have you heard of a key ?  it &apos;s what some people sing in .  
well at least all my songs don &apos;t taste like garlic .  yeah ,  there are other ingredients monica .  
ok ,  so that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .  you know ,  when i &apos;m in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs ,  i &apos;m wearing ear plugs .  
ear plugs ,  or cloves of garlic ?  
you know what ?  i take back what i said before .  you keep playing at the restaurant ,  because with your music driving people inside ,  my bar sales are going up like crazy .  
here &apos;s your copy of the bill ,  we hope you enjoyed your stay .  
oh we did ,  and you still have all your lamps .   
oh ,  i didn &apos;t factor in the room tax .  
oh dude ,  don &apos;t worry about it ,  i found an unattended maid &apos;s car .  we &apos;re way ahead of the game .   
oh my god .  
what ?  
there &apos;s something new in the bowl .  
look ,  we have enough ,  just walk away .  
no ,  but i want .  .  . i want the pinecones !  
there &apos;s a forest right outside .  
it &apos;s not the same .  
ok ,  go quick !   
 thank you for a delightful stay .   
 food here at  &apos;javu &apos; .  . will kill you .  . the food here at  &apos;javu &apos;  .  .  . will kill you .  .   
thank god ,  it &apos;s just you !  i thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall .  
you &apos;d better get back in that kitchen monica ,  the garlic is not gonna overuse itself .  
ok ,  you have to stop playing now .  
why ?  the only person my playing is bothering is you !  
oh yeah ?  ok ,  let &apos;s settle this ,  come on !  
 get your garlic - peelers off me !  
 excuse me ,  excuse me ,  hi ,  i &apos;m monica geller .  . i &apos;m the head chef here .  .   .  .  ok ,  i was actually expecting a little applause there ,  but whatever !  ok ,  quick 
by a show of hands ,  how many of you were bothered by this woman &apos;s singing outside ?   
ok ,  ok ,  how many of you enjoyed the music outside ?   ha !  
alright ,  let me ask you this question the music was fine ,  but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant ?   .  
ok ,  well ,  who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky ?  
ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone ?   
ok ,  well ,  alright ,  who thinks the food is fine ,  the music was fine ,  but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking ?   .  
excuse us !   alright here &apos;s a question so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now ?   
oh .  .  . who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend &apos;s cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great !   
i &apos;m sorry .  .  .  
i &apos;m sorry too .  .  .   
ooohh .  .  .  hey !  wanna stick around and i &apos;ll whip you up some dinner ?  
yeah !  as long as it &apos;s free !  food here is ridiculously over - p .  .  .   
hey !  
hey !  
joey ,  do you have peanut butter on the back of your head ?  
 oh man !  i thought i got it all !  
 how .  .  . how .  .  .  ?  
i was making a peanut butter smoothy ,  right ?  
uh - huh 
and i couldn &apos;t find this little plastic thing  that goes on top of the blender .  .  . and i thought .  .  . well .  .  .  how important can that be ,  right .  .  .  ?  turns out very !  
 wow .  .  . definitely just drake .  .  .  
what ?  
what .  .  . how is it going with drake ?  
oh .  .  . i don &apos;t think it &apos;s going very well .  .  .  
what .  .  . that scene i saw was so good !  
well ,  i &apos;m feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow .  .  .  
joey ,  is this that thing that you do when you say you &apos;re bad so i &apos;ll give you a compliment ?  
a little .  yeah no ,  i really am worried ,  you know ,  i mean i have to make it convincing that i &apos;m in love with olivia .  
so ?  
so .  .  . i &apos;ve never played that !  
ooh !  honey ,  it can &apos;t be that hard ,  i mean ,  you &apos;ve been in love before ?  
uh .  .  . well .  .  . just once .  .  . with you .  .  .  
ok .  .  . this could be a little awkward .  .  . i &apos;m just going to blow past it .  .  .  well can &apos;t you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance ?  
 what the hell are you talking about ?  ?  
 alright ,  alright look ,  just uh .  .  .  just try to remember how you felt when you were in love ,  and think about that when you &apos;re playing the scene .  
 oh !  ok ,  yeah ,  i think i can do that .  yeah ok ,  there &apos;s this party scene coming up .  .  and olivia and her husband are there and all drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her ,  but he can &apos;t .  .  .  and that makes me think about all those times when i wanted to grab you and kiss you ,  but you didn &apos;t know so i would just pretend everything was cool ,  but really ,  it was killing me .  
 joey ,  you never .  . you never talked about that before .  .  .  
well .  .  hey ,  you know what else i could use ?  there &apos;s a scene where drake sneaks into olivia &apos;s bedroom ,  and she doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s there  -  which never happened with us !  and he knows he shouldn &apos;t be there ,  but he just wants to look at her .  .  .  you know ?   and i remember all those mornings before you even put on your make - up ,  when i would think to myself ,  my god ,  she .  .  . is .  .  .  beautiful .  .  .   and it hurts so much ,  cuz i knew i could never tell you  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you .   
i got you something from vermont !

 oh !  like what ?  !   oh i &apos;m sorry ,  i don &apos;t mean to pry .  .  .  it &apos;s just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch  &quot; access hollywood &quot;  .  
ok ,  you want the dirt ?  alby was seriously insecure .  i mean ,  he was really intimidated by the guy i dated before him .  
who is intimidating to a guy who won the nobel prize ?

joey ,  you &apos;re so sweet .  
that &apos;s true .  but you know what ,  it doesn &apos;t matter because i already know who you &apos;re gonna go home with tonight .

well you should be .  you missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater .  
you really liked it ?  
oh yeah !  i mean at first i hated it ,  but why wouldn &apos;t i ,  because as a man i &apos;ve been trained  not to listen !   
oh really !  
oh yeah ,  i had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman !  tell me ,  tell me about your first period !  
no !  
did somebody sign your bra ?  
hey ross !  so listen ,  about you and the dinosaur girl ,  are you really just gonna let a couple of nobel prizes scare you off ?  what is that ,  come on ,  a piece of paper ?  
it &apos;s actually a 1 , 000 , 000$ prize .  
go charlie !  but my point is ,  ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them .  maybe she &apos;s looking to ,  you know ,  slum it with some average joe phd .  
yeah ,  maybe .  i do have my whole career in front of me .  i mean ,  i can still win a nobel prize .  although the last two papers i &apos;ve written were widely discredited .  
you &apos;re so much more than just brains !  you &apos;re sweet ,  and kind ,  and funny .  .  .  
and sexy .  
ok well give her a chance to see all of that !  
yeah ,  you &apos;re right ,  thanks pheebs ,  i &apos;m gonna go find her .

that &apos;s different !  i was drunk and stupid !  
well hello  !  
what about all the guys that you &apos;ve got the phone numbers from ?  why don &apos;t you just kiss one of them ?  
i could ,  i could but i don &apos;t want to !  i want to kiss joey !

 hey rach ,  have you seen charlie anywhere ?

yes ,  she is this new professor of my department that i did not kiss .  
i don &apos;t know why joey had to kiss her !  i mean ,  of all the girls at the party ,  god !  
why do you care so much ?

 be - cause ross is the father of my child !  you know .  .  .  and i .  .  .  want him to hook up with lots of women !   i just .  .  .  all i &apos;m saying is .  .  .  i don &apos;t think that joey and charlie have anything in common .  
oh ,  i don &apos;t know ,  they seem to have a shared interest in each other &apos;s tonsils .  .  .  
wow ,  joey and a professor !  can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and joey &apos;s raw sexual magnetism .  .  .  oh ,  those nerds will get laaaaaid !  
all right ,  so .  .  .  ross ,  you &apos;re ok with all this ?  i mean .  .  .  
yeah ,  it &apos;s no big deal .  i mean ,  i just met her and i &apos;m fine with it .  .  .

 so ,  a professor ,  uh ?  
yeah !  she is cool ,  and she &apos;s so smart !  her mind is totally acrimonious  .   that &apos;s not how she used it .  .  .  ?  
 i feel like i owe you an explanation .  i don &apos;t ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties .  i &apos;m .  .  .  well ,  i &apos;m kind of embarrassed .  i really hope you don &apos;t think less of me .  
uhm no !  think less of you !  no ,  i don &apos;t think less of you .  i mean ,  you saw someone you liked and you kissed them .  i mean ,  those people who like someone and don &apos;t kiss them .  .  .  those - those people are stupid ,  i hate those people .  
you know ,  actually i &apos;m a little surprised to myself .  i mean ,  joey is so different from the guys i usually date .  i mean ,  they &apos;re all professors ,  and intellectuals ,  and paleontologists mostly ,  you know ,  very cerebral .  .  .  
yeah ,  i know the type .  
 hey !  
hey !  
hey you guys !  look what i just got .   
oh ,  oh !  wow ,  i love those !  where did you get them ?  
i bought them off ebay !  they used to belong to the late shania twain .  
 phoebe ,  shania twain is still alive !  
oh .  .  .  then i overpaid .   
hey ,  what &apos;s this ?  
oh ,  it &apos;s a gift certificate to this new spa in soho .  
oh ,  you can &apos;t show phoebe this !  she hates those corporate massage chains .  
ah ,  why ,  now i can &apos;t get a massage ?  there are so many things that she disapproves of !  i can &apos;t eat veal ,  i can &apos;t wear fur ,  i can &apos;t go hunting .  .  .  
do you wanna go hunting ?  
well ,  i would like to have the option !  !  
 what &apos;s up ?   hey ,  rachel !  !  
oh !  
no ,  you can &apos;t go there !  you know how i feel about these  &quot; big massage places &quot;  !  they &apos;re putting people like me out of business !  
and she wants to go hunting ,  too !  !  
phoebe ,  come on ,  i don &apos;t wanna waste it !  it would be like throwing away a hundred bucks !  
ok ,  this is not about the money ,  ok ?  it &apos;s about .  .  .  it &apos;s about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us .  .  .  the hollow shells .  
i don &apos;t care about any of that !  !  
well ,  do you care about friendship ?  
oh !  
i feel really strongly about this ,  rachel .  please ,  don &apos;t use this gift certificate .  i &apos;m asking you as a friend .

we really need to take those tests ?  
honey ,  we &apos;ve been trying to have a baby for over a year .  i think it &apos;s a good idea to find out if everything &apos;s ok .  just a few routine tests .  
but i don &apos;t wanna do it in a cup !  
what is the big deal ?  
it &apos;s weird !  in a doctor &apos;s office ?  
it &apos;s not ok to do it in a doctor &apos;s office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a taco bell ?  
 i cannot believe ross told you that !   and in my defense ,  it was a wendy &apos;s !  
look ,  i don &apos;t wanna do this test either ,  but i really do think it &apos;s a good idea !  
yeah ,  ok .  i &apos;m sure that doctor &apos;s office can &apos;t be worst than on a class trip to the hershey &apos;s factory !  
 oh !  
 who says that wine has to cost more than milk !

wow ,  a swedish massage from a real swedish person .   
okay ,  then i &apos;m swedish .  .  .  
so ,  what &apos;s your name ?  
it &apos;s a normal swedish name .  .  .  ikea .  .  .  
oh .  .  .  what an interesting name .  
ja !  
you know i .  .  .   
 time for your scalp massage !  
 wow .  .  .  i really love your .  .  .   
is something wrong ?  
no ,  it &apos;s just that uhm .  .  .  it feels so good .  .  .  ikea .  .  .   yeah ,  say hey ,  you &apos;ll know this ,  what &apos;s the capital of sweden ?  
 uhm .  .  .  stockholm .  
 note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas .  monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself .  
now ,  do you have any idea what you just said ?  
(shaking his head as if to say says the words ,  my brain is thinking monster trucks !  
ok now ,  remember ,  when you get to the museum ,  monet is not spelt m - o - n - a - y .  i just .  .  .  i wrote that out phonetically for you .  
phonetically ?   
yeah ,  yeah that means .  .  .  you know ?  we just .  .  .  we don &apos;t have time for this .  
ok .  
ok ,  but you know what ?  i gotta say ,  i &apos;m really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly !  
ah !  i &apos;m an actor !  i can memorize anything !  last week on  &quot; days &quot;  i had to say  &quot; frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy &quot;  .  
wow .  what does that mean ?  
no idea !  but the guy i said it to dies in the next scene so i guess it means  &quot; you &apos;re gonna get eaten by a bear &quot;  .  
ok !  so let &apos;s move on to the renaissance ?  
ok ,  caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure .  touch it ,  it &apos;s really bumpy !   .  
nah ah !  nah ah !   no no no !  no ad - libbing and dude ,  you can &apos;t touch the paintings .  
come on !  you .  .  .   
 my specimen is in the room and i just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while i was in there .  really helped speed the process along !   janice !  you &apos;re not .  .  .  gone ?  
oh !  sid is still in his room .  i don &apos;t allow porn at home so this is like a vacation for him .  so did you do it ?  did you make your deposit ?  
yeah !  yeah .  .  .  the hard part is over !  
that &apos;s not the hard part honey !  the hard part is what comes next ,  i mean aren &apos;t you worried about the results ?  
i haven &apos;t .  .  .  i haven &apos;t even thought about the results yet .  .  .  i just assumed that everything was gonna be ok .  
oh !  well ,  you know what ?  it probably is .  
 yeah ,  but what if it &apos;s not ?  what if there is a reason why we can &apos;t have a baby ?  
oh ,  chandler ,  look .  you and monica are meant to have children .  i am sure it &apos;s gonna be just fine .  
 oh ,  oh ,  yeah ,  ok ,  thanks .  i can &apos;t believe i didn &apos;t even think of that .  i guess i was just so worried about having to .  .  .  come here and do .  .  .   &apos;that &apos; .  .  .  
what ,  you can do it in the parking lot of a taco bell ,  but you can &apos;t do it at a doctor &apos;s office ?  
  &quot; ipan stripan ,  glupi glabi !   &quot;  and that is the swedish national anthem !  thank you for asking !   
wow ,  ikea .  .  .  what a rich culture .  uhm ,  you know what ?  i have a friend who is a masseuse .  
oh ,  ja !  ja !  
yah !  she &apos;s .  .  .  uhm .  .  .  not very good though .  .  .   
uhu ,  uhu .  .  .  and why do you think that is ?  
i don &apos;t know .  .  .  maybe it &apos;s because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar .  .  .  
or .  .  .  maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you &apos;re such a high maintenance tight ass !  
 phoebe !  !  
you know it &apos;s me ?  
for like a half an hour !  man ,  you can lie about sweden !  
how can you come here ?  
how could you not tell me you worked here ?  
i don &apos;t have to tell you everything !  
yes you do ,  if you &apos;re going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage !  
tips not included .  
oh !  phoebe ,  why did you lie to me about working here ?  
because i was ashamed ok ?  i sold out for the cash !  and then they give me benefits like medical ,  and dental ,  and a 401k .  but you know .  .  .  you pay a price .  now i &apos;m this corporate stooge and punching a clock and ugh !  paying taxes !  
phoebe ,  honey ,  if you hate it so much ,  you should walk out there right now and quit !  be true to what you believe in !  honey ,  you have principles and i so admire that !  i don &apos;t have any !  
you know what ?  you are right .  i am gonna quit .  it &apos;s time i took my life back !  
good for you pheebs !  
ok .  
haha !  got ya !  die ,  die ,  die !   
 respectfully ,  professor r .  geller .   hey !  
hi !  
hey ,  how was the met ?  
the museum was amazing !  
yeah ?  joey really knows his art ,  huh ?  
not so much ,  no .  he had clearly memorized all the stuff to say ,  and some of it didn &apos;t even make any sense .  
what do you mean ?  
well ,  for one ,  he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around .  
 wait a minute .  .  .  when you guys walked into the met ,  did you go to the right ?  
no ,  we went to the left .  
 oh joey ,  joey !  but still ,  i mean ,  it seems like you guys are having a great time together .  
yeah ,  it &apos;s fun  .  
what ?  
actually ,  you know ,  joey is your friend ,  and you don &apos;t really know me that well; it would be weird .  
what ,  i mean ,  a little ,  but no ,  what ,  go on .  
well .  .  .  i &apos;m just thinking that maybe he &apos;s not the right guy to be with right now ,  maybe i should be with someone .  .  .  i have more in common with .  you know what i mean ?  
 yeah .  but you know what ?  i think you should give joey a chance .  i mean ,  he &apos;s a great guy ,  and sure he doesn &apos;t know that much about art but you know ,  you can always talk about that with someone else .  
yeah ,  i guess that &apos;s true .  
and if you think about it ,  i mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you .  you know ,  that &apos;s the kind of guy joey is .  
he is very sweet .  plus he &apos;s hot !  
that was going to be my next argument .   
hey !  
hey !  
hey !  
 you &apos;re ready ?  
yeah ,  let &apos;s go .   thanks ross .  
 hey ross !  that art stuff worked ,  you hooked me up .  
glad i could help man .  
 it is not okay that i &apos;m aroused by this now .   
hello ?  oh hi ,  doctor connelly .   no ,  she &apos;s not here but ,  you know ,  i can tell her .  should i be sitting down for this ?   oh .   well ,  so what does that mean ?   ok .  ok ,  thank you .  thanks .    
hey sweetie .  
doctor connelly just called .  
with good news ?   of course it is not good news ,  you just said   &quot; doctor connelly just called &quot;  .  if it was good news you would have said   &quot; doctor connelly just called !   &quot;  but so what is it ?  is there a problem ,  uh ?  is there a problem with me or with you ?  
actually it &apos;s both of us .  
what ?  
apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment .  
oh .  .  .  what does that mean ?  
it means that my guys won &apos;t get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do .   it means .  .  .  
chandler ?  
 it means that we can keep trying ,  but there &apos;s a good chance this may never happen for us .  
 oh my god !  
i &apos;m sorry .  
i &apos;m sorry too .   
well ,  we &apos;re gonna .  .  .  we &apos;re gonna figure this out .

oh ,  i so can &apos;t believe this !  my uterus is an inhospitable environment ?  i was trying so hard to be a good hostess !  
oh ,  i can &apos;t believe my sperm have low motility because ,  let me tell you ,  when i was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places !  !  
hi .  
hi .  
ok .  
oh ,  damn it !

oh ,  yeah !  let &apos;s do it !  
 alright ,  have a good time .

 hey ,  you guys !  
hi .  
guess who &apos;s up for keynote speaker at the national paleontology conference ?  
umh .  .  .  kurts baley ?  
yeah ,  right !  what was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract  well ,  why are you laughing ?  
just .  .  .  seeing what it &apos;d be like to be a paleontologist .  .  .  it &apos;s fun ,  yeah !  
so you &apos;re up for keynote speaker !  who &apos;s making the decisions ?  
professor sherman ,  yeah .  i &apos;ve a meeting with him today .  
he &apos;s a pretty tough guy to impress .  
yeah ,  well .  .  .  i think i know how to dazzle him .  
oh .  .  .  you &apos;re not gonna do a magic trick ,  are ya ?  
tsz .  .  .  no !   .  
 hey guys !  
wait a minute ,  you guys .  oh ,  i wanna ask you something .  i - i i may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if i do ,  i &apos;d love for you guys to come and hear me .  
i think i can safely say that we all have family issues ,  work stuff and / or are sick .  
it &apos;s in barbados .  
but you come first !  
i &apos;m there !  
we &apos;ll see you ,  guys !   
bye .  
bye ,  see ya .   
 ok .  
all right ,  so .  how did it go at the fertility clinic ?  
not as much fun as last time .  apparently you only get porn if you &apos;re giving a sperm sample .  
so - so what did the doctor say ?  
well .  .  .  there &apos;s surrogacy ,  but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child ,  she has felt that watching a surrogate would be .  .  .  too hard for her .  
so you &apos;re ruling out surrogacy ?  
yeah .  
so ,  i don &apos;t have to learn what that means ?  
aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination ,  so .  .  .  we &apos;re talking about sperm donors .  
enough said ,  i &apos;m there for you man .  where is she ,  upstairs ?  
 ah - ha !  
how do you feel about all this ?  
i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but i don &apos;t think there is one .  
come on ross ,  be a good guy .  step up and do it !  
 what ?   
the data we are receiving from mri scans and dna testing of these fossils are  -  are staggering .  
 i mean ,  we &apos;ve been accepting leakey &apos;s dates as a given ,  but if they &apos;re off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can  -  you can just throw most of our assumptions ,  you know ,  right in the trash .   so - so what i am saying is  -  is is that  is that the repercussions could be huge !  i mean ,  not just in palaeontology ,  but if - if you think about it ,  in evolutionary biology ,  uh ,  genetics ,  geology ,  uh ,  i mean ,  truly the mind boggles !   
oh ,  i &apos;ll take some of that .  
pheebs ,  that &apos;s for men !  
no ,  i know ,  this way when i go to the party later mike will know i am over him cause i &apos;m gonna smell like another guy .   yeah .   
ok .  oh good ,  i &apos;m dating a russian cab driver .   .  seriously does anyone buy this ?  i smell like beets !  
 so ,  you know what ,  i really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them .  where do you think those would be ?  
on melanie griffith in  &quot; working girl &quot;  .  i think what you want is over here .  
see ,  i told you i needed someone !  oh ,  you know ,  by the way ,  as a  &quot; thank you &quot;  ,  i would really love to take you out .  
really ?  
yeah !  actually joey and i are going to the movies tonight ,  wanna come ?  
oh ,  i can &apos;t .  because i - i &apos;ve seen them .  
you &apos;ve seen all the movies .  .  .  
yeah !  i &apos;m a big fan !  of the movies ,  you know .  motion pictures .  the talkies !  
 hey rach ,  will you come with me to a dressing room ?  
sure !  
ok !  
wha ,  you know ,  maybe we can do something else !  
you know that depends on what it is !  i &apos;ve done a lot of stuff .   
so what were you doing out there ,  do you not like charlie ?  
she &apos;s ok ,  i just don &apos;t get a really good vibe from her !  
why ?  
i don &apos;t know ,  you know ,  just the way she waltzed in here all smart ,  and tall !  you know ,  and just swept joey off his feet .  .  .  i mean ,  nobody else has a chance !  
who else ?  
anybody !  you ,  me ,  you know ,  monica &apos;s mom .  .  .  
you like joey ?  
shhhhh !  phoebe !  all right ,  look .  i have a little thing for him .  
 oh my god !  
it &apos;s just physical and i have it totally under control !  ok ?  it &apos;s just ,  when i see them together ,  sometimes i just get a little jealous !  
uh ,  wow !  isn &apos;t it ironic that he liked you and now you like him ?  
 oh ,  i get it !  
oh well ,  as long as it is under control ,  you know ,  you can &apos;t do anything about it ,  he &apos;s already dating her ,  and she is a nice person ,  that wouldn &apos;t be right .  
i know ,  i know ,  so it is just not a big deal .  
yeah .  
so can we keep this between us ?  
sure !  
ok ,  great ,  because i gotta get out of here ,  the smell of beets is killing me !  
oh .   
hi honey !  
hey !  look i brought a friend for dinner ,  this is zack ,  from work !  
oh ,  of course ,  it &apos;s so nice to see you again ,  zack !  
 you too .  
you guys haven &apos;t actually met before ,  but ,  boy !  you &apos;re both polite !   go to have a seat zack ,  and i &apos;ll get you a beer .  
i got it .  
thanks .  
 so ,  zack &apos;s pretty nice ,  uh ?  
yeah ,  i guess .  
so ,  how would you like to have a baby that &apos;s half yours and half his !  
 excuse me ?  
well ,  we &apos;re talking about sperm donors and zack may be the guy !  i mean ,  look ,  he &apos;s intelligent ,  he &apos;s healthy ,  he &apos;s athletic ,  i mean ,  he is  &quot; spermtastic &quot;  !  
chandler ,  this is crazy !  what did you even say to him !   &quot; come up ,  meet my wife !  give us your sperm &quot;  !  
no ,  i invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him !  i mean ,  if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy ,  get to check him out .  
chandler !  
i &apos;m telling you ,  he &apos;s great !  i mean ,  even if my sperm worked fine ,  i &apos;d think he &apos;d be the way to go !  
i &apos;m not going to be a part of this !  you can &apos;t just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor !  
ok !  
uh !  
 zack !  
thanks !  do you have a coaster ?  i don &apos;t wanna make a ring .   
oh ,  god ,  do you think she heard ?  it would be so bad if she heard !  
well ,  maybe she didn &apos;t hear !  ok i &apos;m gonna go into that dressing room ,  you stay in here and i &apos;ll talk and see if you can hear me .  
ok ,  great !   
oh ,  thank god i can &apos;t hear a word that you &apos;re saying !  
 i didn &apos;t say anything yet !  
 well ,  get back in there and talk !  
 i &apos;m rachel .  it &apos;s so annoying when i put emma on the phone to talk with my friends .  
 what !  ?  
 well ,  some things are just hard to say to your face .  
ok well ,  i heard that !  which means that she heard it too !  
ooh !  we have a problem .  
oh !  what are we gonna do ?   
just be honest with her .  
oh my god !  
and it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone .  .  .

no .  no .  .  .  eh .  .  .  she went shopping with rachel .  why ?  what &apos;s up ?

alright !  just follow my lead !   
you guys have such a great place here .  
oh !  thanks ,  i &apos;m crazy about our place .  hey !  speaking of crazy .  .  .  do you have a history of mental illness in the family ?

 rachel .  .  .  i heard you guys whispering .  
oh god .  you did .  you heard .  ok ,  listen ,  let me explain .  
no !  there &apos;s nothing to explain .  i heard you .  phoebe likes joey .  
 yeah .  
it &apos;s just that .  .  .  i don &apos;t understand it .  .  .  i mean ,  phoebe likes joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy .  .  .  ?  
yeah !  that &apos;s phoebe .  that &apos;s phoebe .  you know ,  she just wants them all !  it &apos;s like she &apos;s a nympho !  
wow !

you know ,  by the way .  i heard you tell her not to do anything .  thanks for sticking up for me .  you are such a nice person .  
 i try .  .  .  
 
 oh my god !  you really want me to be the keynote speaker ?  thank you !   
 
 wow !  you look .  .  .   .  .  .  stop - eating hot !  which is like the highest level of hotness !  
are you sure ?  because i &apos;m really dreading going to this party .  
then don &apos;t go !  
mike knows i &apos;m coming ,  and if i don &apos;t show up he &apos;ll think it &apos;s because of him !  and i don &apos;t want to lose face !  that &apos;s a very serious thing in my culture .  
alright ,  then you go to that party and you pretend to be over mike .  and afterward you come to my place and i &apos;ll get you good and drunk !  
david ?   
phoebe !  hi !  
oh my god !   
wow ,  you look unbelievable .  
yeah .  what - what are you doing here ?  
well ,  i &apos;m back from minsk .  .  .  permanently .  
what happened ?  
well ,  remember how i was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles ?  
yeah ?  
well ,  after eight years of research i discovered that it can &apos;t be done .  
well ,  it &apos;s great that you &apos;re back !  how are you ?  
good ,  good ,  life is good .  .  .  
good !  
ah well ,  i - i &apos;m seeing someone .  
 oh ,  good for you .  
she &apos;s also a scientist ,  so she &apos;s very smart and pretty and .  .  .  well ,  it &apos;s actually because of you ,  really ,  that we &apos;re together ,  i mean ,  i saw what you had with that mike guy ,  and i just said  &quot; boy ,  i want that &quot;  .  
mike and i broke up .  
you &apos;re kidding me .  because i &apos;m not seeing anybody ,  i &apos;ve just totally made that up .  
really ?  
yeah ,  i don &apos;t know why ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  i guess i just didn &apos;t want to lose face .  
i understand .  yeah .  ok so then ok ,  so we &apos;re both living in new york ,  not seeing anyone .  that &apos;s so not like us !  
yeah ,  i know .  well .  .  .  this is probably a stupid question ,  seeing that you look like that ,  but do you have some place that you need to be right now ?  
well .  .  .   no .  
do you wanna get a drink ?  
i &apos;d love to .  
great .  
ok .   
do you smell beets ?  
oh ,  got it ,  stay upwind of me .   
hey ,  there &apos;s phoebe !  is that mike she &apos;s with ?  
no ,  that &apos;s david .  
there &apos;s a third guy ?  
 tip of the iceberg .   
i &apos;m gonna take off now .  you &apos;re gonna let me go home ,  aren &apos;t you ?  
you sure you don &apos;t wanna stick around a little longer ?  
no ,  no ,  i should get home ,  i &apos;m kinda tired .  
are you just tired now or are you always tired ,   &apos;cause that could be a sign of clinical depression .  
no it &apos;s just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died .  i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .  
ok .   
i think we &apos;ve found our sperm !  
does seem pretty perfect .  
yeah ,  you think so ,  well ?  should i ask him ?  
 no .  
why not ,  just because his great - grandmother was obese ,  our kids are gonna get that from you anyway !  
no ,  that &apos;s not it .  it &apos;s just that when we were asking him all those questions before ,  i just .  .  .  i just realized i don &apos;t care if he &apos;s the most perfect guy in the world .  .  .  he &apos;s not you .  
yeah ,  he &apos;s better !  
no ,  he &apos;s not .  and if i can &apos;t get pregnant with you ,  then i don &apos;t want to get pregnant by .  .  .  him or anyone else .  
really ?  are you sure ?  
yeah ,  i &apos;m sure .  
 thank god ,  because i don &apos;t wanna do this either .  you know ,  i was just doing because i thought that was what you wanted to do .  you know ,  i &apos;m the husband ,  i &apos;m supposed to .  .  .  bring the sperm .  
that is so sweet .  i love you .   
so you know this leaves us with .  .  .  
adoption .  
how do you feel about that ?  
i think i feel ok about it .  actually i think i feel really good about it .  
me too .  i wanna find a baby that needs a home and i wanna raise it with you .  and i wanna mess it up in our own specific way .  
so this is it ,  we &apos;re really gonna adopt ?  
 yeah .  
 oh my god ,  we &apos;re gonna be parents !  
we are gonna be great parents .  
and it could be soon .  i mean ,  think about it 
wait ,  if we &apos;re lucky ,  and we &apos;re really really really quiet ,  we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking !   
hey ,  zack !  
 hey chandler .  
look ,  i just wanted to apologize for last night .  i got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable .  
no you didn &apos;t .  
really ?  
no you did .  
my wife and i have some boundary issues ,  you know ,  sometimes we ask inappropriate questions .  we &apos;re working on it .   
 here are the boards for friday &apos;s pitch  .  
oh ,  thank you .   
 hey !  i &apos;m all packed and ready to go !  
oh ,  that &apos;s right !   daddy and uncle joey are going on a trip today .  we &apos;re going to a conference in barbados ,  right ?  
mmh - mmh .  
 can you say barbados ?  
barbados !  
ok ,  i gotta say .  i mean ,  it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech !  uh !  and i &apos;ve a surprise ,  uh .  .  .  i had to pull some strings but i was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference !  that &apos;s right !   this babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars .  
do you have anything that would .  .  .  get us out of them ?  
yeah ross ,  i mean .  .  .  we &apos;re excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we &apos;re gonna wanna do ,  you know ,   &quot; island &apos;s stuff &quot;  .  
i think david would probably wanna hear a few lectures .  
oh ,  right ,  because he &apos;s a scientist !  
no ,  no ,  because ,  you know ,  he &apos;s been in minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight ,  he &apos;ll die .  
ok ,  we gotta go ,  yeah ?  so ,  we &apos;ll see you guys tomorrow .  
all right ,  let &apos;s do it !  5 hour flight with charlie ,  have a couple of drinks ,  get under that blanket and do what comes naturally .  
it &apos;s a blanket joe ,  not a cloak of invisibility !  
wow !  this place is beautiful !  
 look at all these paleontologists !  !  
i know ,  there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow !   
oh my god ,  i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re here !  
 i think i &apos;ve been recognized ,  this happens all the time !  
doctor geller ,  i &apos;m such a huge fan !  
that .  .  .  never happens .  .  .  
i &apos;ve been following your career for years ,  i - i can &apos;t wait for your keynote speech .

i would love your autograph .

 are you a paleontologist ?  
no ,  god ,  no !  no !  no no ,  i &apos;m an actor .  you &apos;d probably recognize me from a little show called  &quot; the days of our lives &quot;  .  
dude ,  it &apos;s just  &quot; days of our lives &quot;  .  .  .  there &apos;s no the .  
 ok ,  ross !  it &apos;s .  .  .  it &apos;s fun ,  yeah !  no ,  i - i play doctor drake ramoray .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  i don &apos;t own a tv .  
david ,  can you help me ?  !  i &apos;m trying to explain to chandler how a plane stays in the air .  
oh ,  certainly .  that &apos;s a combination of bernoulli &apos;s principle and newton &apos;s third law of motion .  
 see ?  
yeah ,  that &apos;s the same as  &quot; it has something to do with wind &quot;  .  
alright ,  i &apos;m gonna go pick up a few things for the trip .  
oh ,  i should go ,  too .  oh ,  now .  .  .  tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should mike and i just meet you there .   
mike ?  ?  who &apos;s mike ?  
mike is your ex .  .  .  uh .  .  .  boyfriend !  
that &apos;s right !  oh ,  yeah .  .  .  well ,  i &apos;ve totally forgotten about im !  ah !  that &apos;s - that &apos;s .  .  .  a blast from the past !  
it &apos;s ok .  ho - honest mistake .  
really ,  it doesn &apos;t mean anything .  i mean ,  you know ,  monica refers to chandler as richard all the time !  
 she does ?  
 let &apos;s get you out of here !  !    
at least you took me down with you !  
i &apos;m sooo sorry !  !  i just .  .  .  i keep thinking about mike !  i &apos;m crazy about david ,  and we &apos;re having so much fun together .  why - why do i miss mike ?  that &apos;s - that &apos;s gonna go away ,  right ?  
i guess ,  in time .  
yeah .  
i mean ,  my feelings for richard are certainly gone .  
 well ,  phoebe &apos;s still pretty hung up on that mike ,  uh ?  
i wouldn &apos;t read too much into it .  
still you know ,  a girl calls you by your ex - boyfriend &apos;s name ,  that - that &apos;s not a good thing ,  right ?  
david ,  let me stop you there  &apos;cause i think i see where this is going .  i &apos;m not very good at giving advice .  so if you want advice ,  go to ross ,  monica ,  or .  .  .  joey ,  if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee .  
sorry ,  i just .  .  .  i wish there was something i could do ,  you know ?  well ,  you know phoebe .  .  .  
seriously ,  we &apos;re gonna do this ?  
i &apos;m sorry ,  uh .  .  .  i just wish i could make her forget about mike already ,  you know .  .  .  why did phoebe and mike break up ?  
oh ,  because his penis was too big .   oh ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  that &apos;s the kind of thing i do .   they broke up because mike didn &apos;t want to get married .  hey ,  what if you just let phoebe know you &apos;d be open to marriage ?  
that &apos;s great !  that &apos;s great !  i - i &apos;ll propose to her !  
what ?  
well ,  i was probably going to do it at some point .  
i didn &apos;t mean now .  .  .  
why not ?  it &apos;s brilliant !   goodbye mike ,  we &apos;ll see you at the wedding ,  fella !   well ,  we probably won &apos;t invite you to the wedding .  .  .   thank you ,  chandler .  sincerely .  
well ,  you &apos;re welcome !  glad i could help .  
 how do you think i should propose ?  
david ,  i &apos;m pretending to read here !  !  
 
yeah !  how you doin &apos; ?  yeah alright !   
hey ,  hey !  you said you &apos;re gonna wear a thong ,  where &apos;s the thong ?  
 i didn &apos;t mean a thong .  .  .  i meant thongs .  .  .  
you really should have been more clear about that !   
hey !  
hey !  
 you &apos;re never going to guess who i just saw downstairs !  
oh !  ah !  eh .  .  .  britney spears !  ?  
yeah ,  she never misses these conferences !   no ,  i just saw dr .  kenneth schwartz !  
oh my god !  did you talk to him ?  
yeah .  .  .  what am i going to say to kenneth schwartz ?  
you could say 
 ready to go ?  
yeah !  
wha .  .  .  ?  you &apos;re gonna go now ?  i thought we could hang out ?  
oh i can &apos;t .  .  .  i have seminars all day and i promised ross i would look at his speech .  
yeah .  
but maybe we can have dinner later ?  on the balcony ?  will be romantic .  
 will you wear a thong ?  
i will if you will .  
oh .  .  .  you got yourself a very weird deal !  
 i &apos;m good ,  i have dinner plans  .  
so you &apos;ll be ok ?  
yeah ,  yeah .  i &apos;ve got tons of stuff i could do .  i &apos;m gonna hit the beach ,  go swimming .  .  .  
uh ,  joe ,  have you looked outside ?  
no ,  why ?   
oh man !  
there &apos;s an indoor pool ,  you can swim there !   
wow !  that mike thing was interesting !  i don &apos;t know what &apos;s gonna happen with phoebe and david .  
 i do !  want a hint ?  huh ?   &quot; i do &quot;    &quot; i do &quot;  .  
ok ,  i &apos;m sensing that this is some kind of word play ,  because you are pink with barely controlled glee .  
david is going to propose to phoebe .  
what ?   why ?  
be - cause ,  we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married .  
chandler ,  we have talked about this .  you are not supposed to give people advice !  now couldn &apos;t you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke ?  
i did !  a penis one !  look ,  just so i know ,  what was so wrong about what i said ?  
they &apos;ve only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike !  she &apos;ll say  &quot; no &quot;  ,  david &apos;s heart will be broken ,  it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again .  
man ,  that &apos;s some bad advice !  
 
oh !  hey !  thank god you guys are here !  
hey !  hey what &apos;s going on ?  
everything is upside down here !  it rains all day long ,  nobody watches tv and ross is famous !   
alright ,  i don &apos;t wanna alarm anybody ,  but monica &apos;s hair is twice as big as it was when we landed !   
ok !  when i go places with high humidity ,  it gets a little extra body ,  ok ?  !  
that &apos;s why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross !  
come on ,  i &apos;ll show you guys where to check in  
 oh ,  honey ,  can you make sure we get a king size bed !  
 oh !  david ,  get one for us too !  oh ,  oh ,  and see if they have a heart - shaped one !  and with mirrors on the ceiling !  
 and make sure our room isn &apos;t next to theirs  .  
ooh !  you guys are so lucky you are here with people ,  you known it &apos;s such a romantic place .  that &apos;s all ,  i just wish i could  share that with a guy .  
not joey .  
not joey ,  no ,  i was just lusting after chandler .  
yeah ,  right !   
so ,  ehm .  .  .  i &apos;m proposing to pheobe tonight .   
tonight ?  !   isn &apos;t an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond ?   oh ,  there it is !  
yeah ,  well ,  being a failed scientist doesn &apos;t pay quite as well as you might think .  that &apos;s uhm .  .  .  one seventieth of a karat .  and the clarity is uhm .  .  .  is quite poor .  
 nice !   
monica ,  can i talk to you for a sec ?   
ok !  
david is going to propose to phoebe tonight !  
see what happens when you give people advice ?  i hope you told him not to ?  
that would be advice !  !  
ok fine .  i &apos;ll handle this .   phoebe ?  
yeah ?  
 i need to talk to you .  
are you leaving  &quot; the supremes &quot;  ?   
ok ,  my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice .  look ,  david is going to propose to you tonight .  
wow ?  really ?  that &apos;s fantastic !  
what are you serious ?  you wanna marry him ?  wha .  .  .  what about mike ?  
oh ,  ok ,  you want me to marry mike ?  alright ,  well ,  let &apos;s just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle .  i can just see it 
do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer ?  
by using ct scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way ,  bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century .  
it &apos;s great .  you &apos;re gonna be the hit of the conference .  
oh and you know what ,  it will be even better tomorrow ,  because i won &apos;t be constantly interrupted by joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet .   .  
hey guys !  
the chocolates aren &apos;t here yet .  
damnit !  
ross just read me his speech .  it &apos;s fantastic !

your first marriage ?

oh my god ,  this is so cool !  
ok ,  odd thing to get excited about !  
no ,  it &apos;s just .  .  .  i was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay !  
hey !  high - five !   
didn &apos;t you feel so stupid that you didn &apos;t see the signs ?  my fianc was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner .  
my wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year .  she didn &apos;t get any fitter .  
right and then everybody finds out and they &apos;re like 
i know !  it &apos;s like ,  if you knew ,  why didn &apos;t you tell me ,  you know ?  i mean ,  call ,  or leave a note 
i know !  
and then ,  you try to make the best of a bad situation ,  so you float the idea of a threesome ?  
i didn &apos;t do that .  
well ,  who knew ?  pharmacists are fun .  
i know ,  that old lady at the end was ready to take you home .  
not enough pills in the world ,  rach .  what about you ,  you &apos;re the single one ,  seen anybody in there you like ?

yeah .   
ok .  see you ,  bye .  
bye .  
good night .  
night .   
 
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s gonna say yes to david .  she &apos;s clearly in love with mike .  
you know ,  it &apos;s very hard to take you seriously when you look like that .   
uh ,  phoebe ,  uh ,  i have .  .  .  something i wanna say .  
oh my god ,  he &apos;s gonna do it now .  please ,  i cannot watch this ,  let &apos;s go .  
i think we have some time .  have you ever heard him talk ?    &quot; uh ,  phoebe ,  uh ,  i would be honoured ,  uh .  .  .  &quot;  spit it out ,  david !  
uh ,  phoebe ,  uh .  .  .   you &apos;re an amazing woman ,  and the time we spent apart was ,  was unbearable .  of course the sanitation strikes in minsk didn &apos;t help !  
sure ,  ok ,  yeah .  
but well ,  now that we &apos;re together again ,  i don &apos;t ever want to be apart .  so ,  to that end .  .  .   
oh my god ,  mike !  
it &apos;s david ,  actually !  
no ,  mike &apos;s here .  
 hi mike !  
hi david .  chandler .  monica .  .  .   oh !  
it &apos;s the humidity !  
hi phoebe .  
what are you ,  what are you doing here ?  
i have a question i need to ask you .  
i have a question i was kinda gonna ask her myself .  
yeah ,  i understand ,  but before you do ,  she really needs to hear this .  
 ok ,  would you care for my seat as well ?  
actually yeah ,  that &apos;ll be great .  
that &apos;s fair ,  you &apos;ve had a long trip .   
phoebe ,  i love you .  i mean ,  i missed you so much these last few months and i thought we were apart for a good reason ,  but then i suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you .  
kinda stepped on the toes of what i was going to say .  
sorry david ,  but she really has to know this .  
alright ,  but after this i want to see you outside .  if the rain stops .  
you &apos;re the most incredible woman i &apos;ve ever met .  how can i lose you ?   now ,  i don &apos;t actually have a ring .  .  .  
i have a ring .  
i wouldn &apos;t brag too much about that thing ,  big guy .  
phoebe ,  will you marry me ?  
 no !  
uhm .  .  .  ha ha !  
i love you .  but i never needed a proposal from you .  i just needed to know that we were headed somewhere ,  you know ,  that we had a future .  
we can have any future you want .   
ok ,  i &apos;m gonna take off .  
david ,  i &apos;m so sorry ,  i &apos;m sorry .  
just so i know ,  if i had asked first .  .  .  
yeah ,  i might have said yes ,  but that would have been wrong .  
please ,  you don &apos;t have to explain .  i mean ,  perhaps if i hadn &apos;t gone to minsk things would have worked out for us .  and i wouldn &apos;t have ruined my career ,  or lost that toe to frostbite .  it was a good trip !   
is it ok if i hug you now ?  
yes !   
oh ,  ain &apos;t this nice ?  it &apos;s so quiet ,  i could just lie here all day .  
i know   
 open your drapes !  open your drapes !  
i &apos;m so glad we &apos;ve got adjoining rooms !   
the sun is out !  
hey !  remember when i had corneas ?  
ok listen ,  you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs ,  and i &apos;ll get the magazines and the lotion .  
ladies ?  ross &apos;s speech is in 45 minutes .  
nooo !  
damn it !  
then we have to await the data from recent mri scans and dna testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating .  
look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan .  .  .  so leathery and wrinkled ,  i &apos;m so jealous !  
finally ,  factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered 
 not to mention the cold sores .   
and that &apos;s just the herbivores .  i &apos;m not even gonna discuss the carnivores ,  their heads are already too big .  which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development .   
 really ?  
but all kidding aside ,  in much the same way that homo ergaster  is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus .  .  .   
what ?  
he said  &quot; erectus &quot;  !  
you &apos;re .  .  .  you &apos;re kidding ,  right ?  
no ,  he really said it .  
 .  .  .  and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus .  .  .   
erectus ?  
 .  .  .  in a very real way we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century .   thank you !   
oh ,  thanks guys !  
oh !  
 ok .  .  .  now .  .  .  now we &apos;re just holding hands !   
all right !  well ,  uh .  .  .   we &apos;re gonna hit the beach ?  
yeah !  
 it was really .  .  .  great !  
oh ,  thank you so much !  
yeah ,  and so funny !  
oh !   
 ok !  .  .  .  all right ,  thanks !  thank you so much ,  you guys !   oh ,  i can &apos;t tell you how much it means to me that you were here !  
 you &apos;re kidding ,  we wouldn &apos;t have missed it !   
oh .  .  .  i &apos;m back !  
 ok !  .  .  .  uh .  .  .  excuse me ?  yeah ?   
hey !   well .  .  .  ?   
you were incredible !  
yeah ?  
you blew them away !  
oh ,  i can &apos;t tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face !  i mean .  .  .  uh ,  did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me ?  
 i was not !  
no ,  it &apos;s ok !  made me feel like a rock star !  
oh my god !   i &apos;m your groupie !  
 i &apos;d better not found you naked in my hotel room !   
 i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s raining again !  oh ,  it &apos;s so unfair !  !  !   
well ,  on the bright side ,  now you won &apos;t have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off .   not you guys .  you got it going on !   
so ,  what are we gonna do today ?  
they have a game room downstairs !  ping pong and stuff .  
 ping pong ?   honey ,  they have ping pong !  let &apos;s play !  
i don &apos;t think so !

because you know how competitive you get and well ,  i say it &apos;s cute ,  others disagree ,  and i &apos;m lying !  
i &apos;m not always that bad !  
oh ,  yeah ?  what happened when we played last time ?  
 i punched you .  .  .  ?  
and .  .  .  ?

i clunked your heads together !   
 
 hey !  there you are !  
hey !   as soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling !  some kid told me about the sea turtle and ,  if you blow bubbles in its face ,  it chases ya !   
i &apos;m sorry ,  i can &apos;t !  i &apos;m running a discussion group all afternoon .  
 oh .  .  .  oh ,  but that &apos;s ok ,  i &apos;ll find someone else to do it .  .  .  i &apos;ll do it alone ,  but .  .  .  i don &apos;t know what happens if the sea turtle catches you .  .  .  
you know .  .  .  i feel so bad !  i haven &apos;t seen you this whole trip and  especially last night .  .  .  
 hey !  don &apos;t worry about it !  it was fine !  i ended up having the best time with rachel !  i just felt bad for you ,  stuck in that room ,  working on ross &apos;s speech .  .  .   
actually ,  it turned out to be a lot of fun !  
 oh !  oh ,  well !  at least we &apos;re both having fun !  
yeah .  .  .   
 .  .  .  is it weird that it &apos;s not with each other ?

c &apos;mon guys ,  it &apos;ll be fun !

i knew that was him !  
anyway i just ,  uh ,  i think it &apos;s for the best .  
 hey ,  you ok ?  
i guess .  there was hum .  .  .   there was another reason that i thought it was time to end it with joey .  i started to realize that i was having feelings for someone  else .   
 ok geller .  last day of the conference ,  you know what happens to the keynote speaker .  
oh ,  professor clerk we &apos;re kind of in the middle of a conversation ,  here .  
yeah ,  can you guys just throw him in the pool later ?  
 ok ,  gentlemen !  please !  aren &apos;t we a little old for this ?  i mean ,  we &apos;re scientists ,  right ?  we &apos;re academics .  and most importantly i .  .  .  you - you will have to catch us first .   .  go ,  go ,  go !   
 
ok ,  so it &apos;s a tie again ,  41 to 41 .  
 ok ,  look !  enough is enough !  
no ,  i have just to have two more points to beat him !  
monica ,  that was also true an hour ago !  i mean ,  please ,  look at you !  your hand is blistered ,  you can barely stand ,  your hair is inexplicable !  ok ,  you &apos;ve already proven you are just as good as he is ,  now we &apos;ve missed our dinner reservations ,  so now let &apos;s just go upstairs ,  order room service ,  take a shower and shave your head !  
i can &apos;t just walk away !  i &apos;ve put in four hours !  
but .  .  .  
look !  you knew this about me when you married me !  you agreed to take me in sickness and in health .  well ,  this is my sickness !

because i &apos;m gonna play for ya .  
you can &apos;t do that !  
oh ,  that &apos;s ok .  i don &apos;t care which of them i beat .  
ok ,  we &apos;re taking that paddle home ,  mister .  
 honey ,  you don &apos;t have to do this .  
 yes ,  i do .  now ,  i may not understand why you have to win so badly ,  but if it &apos;s important to you then it &apos;s important to me ,  because i love you .  
but .  .  .  you suck !  
 you &apos;re welcome ,  sweetheart .   
all right mike ,  let &apos;s get this over with .  sudden death .  whoever wins this point ,  wins .

 oh my god .  that was so amazing !  when did you  hold on !  i almost forgot  loser !   when did you stop sucking ?  
i never sucked ,  i actually didn &apos;t want you to know how good i was !  
why ?  
i don &apos;t know .  
this is so great !  now we can enter into doubles tournaments !  
thanks !  
hi .  
are they still looking for us ?  
yeah .  the bartender said that they split up into two search parties ,  the herbivores and the carnivores .   you know ,  we as a group are not the coolest .   
i don &apos;t think they saw us .  
i don &apos;t think they did .   
hum ,  so ,  i started to say you something earlier ,  hum .  .  .   there was another reason i realized it was time to end it with joey .  i kind of realized i .  .  .  was starting to have feelings .  .  .  for someone else .  
 oh .  can i .  .  .  can i ask who ?  
i think you know .  
i think i know too but i &apos;ve been really wrong about this stuff in the past ,  so .  .  .   
i &apos;m sorry .  .  .  we .  .  .  we can &apos;t .  
all right ,  all right .  
i mean ,  you just went out with my best friend ,  and i just think it &apos;d be a really really bad idea .   or - or not !    
 hey !  i &apos;m all packed and ready to go !  
oh ,  that &apos;s right !   daddy and uncle joey are going on a trip today .  we &apos;re going to a conference in barbados ,  right ?  
mmh - mmh .  
 can you say barbados ?  
barbados !  
ok ,  i gotta say .  i mean ,  it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech !  uh !  and i &apos;ve a surprise ,  uh .  .  .  i had to pull some strings but i was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference !  that &apos;s right !   this babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars .  
do you have anything that would .  .  .  get us out of them ?  
yeah ross ,  i mean .  .  .  we &apos;re excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we &apos;re gonna wanna do ,  you know ,   &quot; island &apos;s stuff &quot;  .  
i think david would probably wanna hear a few lectures .  
oh ,  right ,  because he &apos;s a scientist !  
no ,  no ,  because ,  you know ,  he &apos;s been in minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight ,  he &apos;ll die .  
ok ,  we gotta go ,  yeah ?  so ,  we &apos;ll see you guys tomorrow .  
all right ,  let &apos;s do it !  5 hour flight with charlie ,  have a couple of drinks ,  get under that blanket and do what comes naturally .  
it &apos;s a blanket joe ,  not a cloak of invisibility !  
wow !  this place is beautiful !  
 look at all these paleontologists !  !  
i know ,  there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow !   
oh my god ,  i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re here !  
 i think i &apos;ve been recognized ,  this happens all the time !  
doctor geller ,  i &apos;m such a huge fan !  
that .  .  .  never happens .  .  .  
i &apos;ve been following your career for years ,  i - i can &apos;t wait for your keynote speech .  
wow !  this is very flattering ,  uh .  .  .  
i would love your autograph .

yeah ,  oh and sarah .  .  .  i &apos;d like to introduce you to my colleague ,  uh ,  professor wheeler ,  a - and this is joey tribbiani .  
 are you a paleontologist ?  
no ,  god ,  no !  no !  no no ,  i &apos;m an actor .  you &apos;d probably recognize me from a little show called  &quot; the days of our lives &quot;  .  
dude ,  it &apos;s just  &quot; days of our lives &quot;  .  .  .  there &apos;s no the .  
 ok ,  ross !  it &apos;s .  .  .  it &apos;s fun ,  yeah !  no ,  i - i play doctor drake ramoray .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  i don &apos;t own a tv .  
david ,  can you help me ?  !  i &apos;m trying to explain to chandler how a plane stays in the air .  
oh ,  certainly .  that &apos;s a combination of bernoulli &apos;s principle and newton &apos;s third law of motion .  
 see ?  
yeah ,  that &apos;s the same as  &quot; it has something to do with wind &quot;  .  
alright ,  i &apos;m gonna go pick up a few things for the trip .  
oh ,  i should go ,  too .  oh ,  now .  .  .  tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should mike and i just meet you there .   
mike ?  ?  who &apos;s mike ?  
mike is your ex .  .  .  uh .  .  .  boyfriend !  
that &apos;s right !  oh ,  yeah .  .  .  well ,  i &apos;ve totally forgotten about im !  ah !  that &apos;s - that &apos;s .  .  .  a blast from the past !  
it &apos;s ok .  ho - honest mistake .  
really ,  it doesn &apos;t mean anything .  i mean ,  you know ,  monica refers to chandler as richard all the time !  
 she does ?  
 let &apos;s get you out of here !  !    
at least you took me down with you !  
i &apos;m sooo sorry !  !  i just .  .  .  i keep thinking about mike !  i &apos;m crazy about david ,  and we &apos;re having so much fun together .  why - why do i miss mike ?  that &apos;s - that &apos;s gonna go away ,  right ?  
i guess ,  in time .  
yeah .  
i mean ,  my feelings for richard are certainly gone .  
 well ,  phoebe &apos;s still pretty hung up on that mike ,  uh ?  
i wouldn &apos;t read too much into it .  
still you know ,  a girl calls you by your ex - boyfriend &apos;s name ,  that - that &apos;s not a good thing ,  right ?  
david ,  let me stop you there  &apos;cause i think i see where this is going .  i &apos;m not very good at giving advice .  so if you want advice ,  go to ross ,  monica ,  or .  .  .  joey ,  if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee .  
sorry ,  i just .  .  .  i wish there was something i could do ,  you know ?  well ,  you know phoebe .  .  .  
seriously ,  we &apos;re gonna do this ?  
i &apos;m sorry ,  uh .  .  .  i just wish i could make her forget about mike already ,  you know .  .  .  why did phoebe and mike break up ?  
oh ,  because his penis was too big .   oh ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  that &apos;s the kind of thing i do .   they broke up because mike didn &apos;t want to get married .  hey ,  what if you just let phoebe know you &apos;d be open to marriage ?  
that &apos;s great !  that &apos;s great !  i - i &apos;ll propose to her !  
what ?  
well ,  i was probably going to do it at some point .  
i didn &apos;t mean now .  .  .  
why not ?  it &apos;s brilliant !   goodbye mike ,  we &apos;ll see you at the wedding ,  fella !   well ,  we probably won &apos;t invite you to the wedding .  .  .   thank you ,  chandler .  sincerely .  
well ,  you &apos;re welcome !  glad i could help .  
 how do you think i should propose ?  
david ,  i &apos;m pretending to read here !  !  
 
yeah !  how you doin &apos; ?  yeah alright !   
hey ,  hey !  you said you &apos;re gonna wear a thong ,  where &apos;s the thong ?  
 i didn &apos;t mean a thong .  .  .  i meant thongs .  .  .  
you really should have been more clear about that !   
hey !  
hey !  
 you &apos;re never going to guess who i just saw downstairs !  
oh !  ah !  eh .  .  .  britney spears !  ?  
yeah ,  she never misses these conferences !   no ,  i just saw dr .  kenneth schwartz !  
oh my god !  did you talk to him ?  
yeah .  .  .  what am i going to say to kenneth schwartz ?  
you could say 
 ready to go ?  
yeah !  
wha .  .  .  ?  you &apos;re gonna go now ?  i thought we could hang out ?  
oh i can &apos;t .  .  .  i have seminars all day and i promised ross i would look at his speech .  
yeah .  
but maybe we can have dinner later ?  on the balcony ?  will be romantic .  
 will you wear a thong ?  
i will if you will .  
oh .  .  .  you got yourself a very weird deal !  
 i &apos;m good ,  i have dinner plans  .  
so you &apos;ll be ok ?  
yeah ,  yeah .  i &apos;ve got tons of stuff i could do .  i &apos;m gonna hit the beach ,  go swimming .  .  .  
uh ,  joe ,  have you looked outside ?  
no ,  why ?   
oh man !  
there &apos;s an indoor pool ,  you can swim there !   
wow !  that mike thing was interesting !  i don &apos;t know what &apos;s gonna happen with phoebe and david .  
 i do !  want a hint ?  huh ?   &quot; i do &quot;    &quot; i do &quot;  .  
ok ,  i &apos;m sensing that this is some kind of word play ,  because you are pink with barely controlled glee .  
david is going to propose to phoebe .  
what ?   why ?  
be - cause ,  we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married .  
chandler ,  we have talked about this .  you are not supposed to give people advice !  now couldn &apos;t you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke ?  
i did !  a penis one !  look ,  just so i know ,  what was so wrong about what i said ?  
they &apos;ve only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike !  she &apos;ll say  &quot; no &quot;  ,  david &apos;s heart will be broken ,  it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again .  
man ,  that &apos;s some bad advice !  
 
oh !  hey !  thank god you guys are here !  
hey !  hey what &apos;s going on ?  
everything is upside down here !  it rains all day long ,  nobody watches tv and ross is famous !   
alright ,  i don &apos;t wanna alarm anybody ,  but monica &apos;s hair is twice as big as it was when we landed !   
ok !  when i go places with high humidity ,  it gets a little extra body ,  ok ?  !  
that &apos;s why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross !  
come on ,  i &apos;ll show you guys where to check in  
 oh ,  honey ,  can you make sure we get a king size bed !  
 oh !  david ,  get one for us too !  oh ,  oh ,  and see if they have a heart - shaped one !  and with mirrors on the ceiling !  
 and make sure our room isn &apos;t next to theirs  .  
ooh !  you guys are so lucky you are here with people ,  you known it &apos;s such a romantic place .  that &apos;s all ,  i just wish i could  share that with a guy .  
not joey .  
not joey ,  no ,  i was just lusting after chandler .  
yeah ,  right !   
so ,  ehm .  .  .  i &apos;m proposing to pheobe tonight .   
tonight ?  !   isn &apos;t an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond ?   oh ,  there it is !  
yeah ,  well ,  being a failed scientist doesn &apos;t pay quite as well as you might think .  that &apos;s uhm .  .  .  one seventieth of a karat .  and the clarity is uhm .  .  .  is quite poor .  
 nice !   
monica ,  can i talk to you for a sec ?   
ok !  
david is going to propose to phoebe tonight !  
see what happens when you give people advice ?  i hope you told him not to ?  
that would be advice !  !  
ok fine .  i &apos;ll handle this .   phoebe ?  
yeah ?  
 i need to talk to you .  
are you leaving  &quot; the supremes &quot;  ?   
ok ,  my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice .  look ,  david is going to propose to you tonight .  
wow ?  really ?  that &apos;s fantastic !  
what are you serious ?  you wanna marry him ?  wha .  .  .  what about mike ?  
oh ,  ok ,  you want me to marry mike ?  alright ,  well ,  let &apos;s just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle .  i can just see it 
do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer ?  
by using ct scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way ,  bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century .  
it &apos;s great .  you &apos;re gonna be the hit of the conference .  
oh and you know what ,  it will be even better tomorrow ,  because i won &apos;t be constantly interrupted by joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet .   .

the chocolates aren &apos;t here yet .  
damnit !  
ross just read me his speech .  it &apos;s fantastic !

someone i don &apos;t know sent me an e - mail and i opened it .  
why ,  why would you open it ?  
well ,  it didn &apos;t say  &quot; this is a virus &quot;  !  !

what .  .  .  what am i gonna do ?  my speech is gone ,  chandler !  
it &apos;s not gone !  i mean ,  i &apos;m sure you printed out a copy .  you have a hard copy ,  right ?  
no !  i don &apos;t !  !  
well ,  you must be pretty mad at yourself right now .  .  .  !  
it &apos;s really gone ?  
yep !  i &apos;d like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career !  
i just feel awful .  
yeah ,  well you should !  i mean ,  nude pictures of anna kournikova ?  i mean ,  she &apos;s never even won a major tournament !  
well ,  i tried billy jean king ,  but .  .  .   you know ,  you and monica have the same  &quot; i &apos;m gonna kill you &quot;  look .  .  .  ?  i can usually make it go away by kissing her .  .  .   
get out !   
you know ,  this happens all the time to my computer at work .  
well ,  what do you do ?  
well ,  i usually go .  .  .  play tetris on somebody else &apos;s computer .  
i can &apos;t believe this .  i can &apos;t believe this is happening .  i have to give the keynote speech tomorrow !  ok ?  i have to stand up in front of all these people .  what am i gonna say ?  
i could teach you a speech that i memorized for auditions .  
i don &apos;t think that your monologue from star wars is gonna help me right now ,  joe !  
ross ,  we can solve this .  i just heard your speech .  we can recreate it !  we &apos;ve got all night !  
wha .  .  .  what you really think we can do that ?  
oh wait ,  joey and i are supposed to have dinner  .  
hey don &apos;t worry about that !  i mean ,  ross needs you !  and rachel and i will stay and help anyway we can .  
ugh .  
alright ,  ok ,  let &apos;s do it .   uhm ,  i know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating .  .  .  uhm ,  and then ,  then i move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the mesozoic era ,  the breakup of pangea ,  hello !   and then ,  there &apos;s the .  .  .  eh .  .  .  there &apos;s the overview of the triassic .  
hello ?  
ok ,  mike ,  enough is enough ,  now you love phoebe and she loves you ,  so you need to get over your whole  &quot; i never want to get married &quot;  thing and step up !

this is monica !  i &apos;m phoebe &apos;s friend .  listen ,  phoebe is back with david and he &apos;s going to propose to her ,  and she is going to say  &quot; yes &quot;  but i know she really wants to be with you !  
 he .  .  .  he &apos;s gonna propose ?  
i .  .  .  i &apos;m sorry ,  did you say something ?  i can &apos;t hear through all this damned hair !   
look ,  if phoebe wants to marry david ,  she should ,  i &apos;m not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you .  
you don &apos;t tell me what to do !  i tell you what to do !  just call her .  she &apos;s at the paradise hotel in barbados .  and while i &apos;ve got you ,  you &apos;ve got curly hair .  what do you do in humidity ?   damnit !

phoebe is going to say  &quot; yes &quot;  ?  that &apos;s ,  that &apos;s great !

you know ,  it &apos;s very hard to take you seriously when you look like that .   
uh ,  phoebe ,  uh ,  i have .  .  .  something i wanna say .  
oh my god ,  he &apos;s gonna do it now .  please ,  i cannot watch this ,  let &apos;s go .  
i think we have some time .  have you ever heard him talk ?    &quot; uh ,  phoebe ,  uh ,  i would be honoured ,  uh .  .  .  &quot;  spit it out ,  david !  
uh ,  phoebe ,  uh .  .  .   you &apos;re an amazing woman ,  and the time we spent apart was ,  was unbearable .  of course the sanitation strikes in minsk didn &apos;t help !  
sure ,  ok ,  yeah .  
but well ,  now that we &apos;re together again ,  i don &apos;t ever want to be apart .  so ,  to that end .  .  .   
oh my god ,  mike !  
it &apos;s david ,  actually !  
no ,  mike &apos;s here .  
 hi mike !  
hi david .  chandler .  monica .  .  .   oh !  
it &apos;s the humidity !  
hi phoebe .  
what are you ,  what are you doing here ?  
i have a question i need to ask you .  
i have a question i was kinda gonna ask her myself .  
yeah ,  i understand ,  but before you do ,  she really needs to hear this .  
 ok ,  would you care for my seat as well ?  
actually yeah ,  that &apos;ll be great .  
that &apos;s fair ,  you &apos;ve had a long trip .   
phoebe ,  i love you .  i mean ,  i missed you so much these last few months and i thought we were apart for a good reason ,  but then i suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you .  
kinda stepped on the toes of what i was going to say .  
sorry david ,  but she really has to know this .  
alright ,  but after this i want to see you outside .  if the rain stops .  
you &apos;re the most incredible woman i &apos;ve ever met .  how can i lose you ?   now ,  i don &apos;t actually have a ring .  .  .  
i have a ring .  
i wouldn &apos;t brag too much about that thing ,  big guy .  
phoebe ,  will you marry me ?  
 no !  
uhm .  .  .  ha ha !  
i love you .  but i never needed a proposal from you .  i just needed to know that we were headed somewhere ,  you know ,  that we had a future .  
we can have any future you want .   
ok ,  i &apos;m gonna take off .  
david ,  i &apos;m so sorry ,  i &apos;m sorry .  
just so i know ,  if i had asked first .  .  .  
yeah ,  i might have said yes ,  but that would have been wrong .  
please ,  you don &apos;t have to explain .  i mean ,  perhaps if i hadn &apos;t gone to minsk things would have worked out for us .  and i wouldn &apos;t have ruined my career ,  or lost that toe to frostbite .  it was a good trip !   
is it ok if i hug you now ?  
yes !   
oh ,  ain &apos;t this nice ?  it &apos;s so quiet ,  i could just lie here all day .  
i know   
 open your drapes !  open your drapes !  
i &apos;m so glad we &apos;ve got adjoining rooms !   
the sun is out !  
hey !  remember when i had corneas ?  
ok listen ,  you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs ,  and i &apos;ll get the magazines and the lotion .  
ladies ?  ross &apos;s speech is in 45 minutes .  
nooo !  
damn it !  
then we have to await the data from recent mri scans and dna testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating .  
look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan .  .  .  so leathery and wrinkled ,  i &apos;m so jealous !  
finally ,  factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered 
 not to mention the cold sores .   
and that &apos;s just the herbivores .  i &apos;m not even gonna discuss the carnivores ,  their heads are already too big .  which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development .   
 really ?  
but all kidding aside ,  in much the same way that homo ergaster  is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus .  .  .   
what ?  
he said  &quot; erectus &quot;  !  
you &apos;re .  .  .  you &apos;re kidding ,  right ?  
no ,  he really said it .  
 .  .  .  and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus .  .  .   
erectus ?  
 .  .  .  in a very real way we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century .   thank you !   
oh ,  thanks guys !  
oh !  
 ok .  .  .  now .  .  .  now we &apos;re just holding hands !   
all right !  well ,  uh .  .  .   we &apos;re gonna hit the beach ?  
yeah !  
 it was really .  .  .  great !  
oh ,  thank you so much !  
yeah ,  and so funny !  
oh !   
 ok !  .  .  .  all right ,  thanks !  thank you so much ,  you guys !   oh ,  i can &apos;t tell you how much it means to me that you were here !  
 you &apos;re kidding ,  we wouldn &apos;t have missed it !   
oh .  .  .  i &apos;m back !  
 ok !  .  .  .  uh .  .  .  excuse me ?  yeah ?   
hey !   well .  .  .  ?   
you were incredible !  
yeah ?  
you blew them away !  
oh ,  i can &apos;t tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face !  i mean .  .  .  uh ,  did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me ?  
 i was not !  
no ,  it &apos;s ok !  made me feel like a rock star !  
oh my god !   i &apos;m your groupie !  
 i &apos;d better not found you naked in my hotel room !   
 i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s raining again !  oh ,  it &apos;s so unfair !  !  !   
well ,  on the bright side ,  now you won &apos;t have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off .   not you guys .  you got it going on !   
so ,  what are we gonna do today ?  
they have a game room downstairs !  ping pong and stuff .  
 ping pong ?   honey ,  they have ping pong !  let &apos;s play !  
i don &apos;t think so !  
 why not ?  
because you know how competitive you get and well ,  i say it &apos;s cute ,  others disagree ,  and i &apos;m lying !  
i &apos;m not always that bad !  
oh ,  yeah ?  what happened when we played last time ?  
 i punched you .  .  .  ?  
and .  .  .  ?  
 .  .  .  phoebe .  .  .  ?  
 .  .  .  and .  .  .  ?  
i clunked your heads together !   
 
 hey !  there you are !  
hey !   as soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling !  some kid told me about the sea turtle and ,  if you blow bubbles in its face ,  it chases ya !   
i &apos;m sorry ,  i can &apos;t !  i &apos;m running a discussion group all afternoon .  
 oh .  .  .  oh ,  but that &apos;s ok ,  i &apos;ll find someone else to do it .  .  .  i &apos;ll do it alone ,  but .  .  .  i don &apos;t know what happens if the sea turtle catches you .  .  .  
you know .  .  .  i feel so bad !  i haven &apos;t seen you this whole trip and  especially last night .  .  .  
 hey !  don &apos;t worry about it !  it was fine !  i ended up having the best time with rachel !  i just felt bad for you ,  stuck in that room ,  working on ross &apos;s speech .  .  .   
actually ,  it turned out to be a lot of fun !  
 oh !  oh ,  well !  at least we &apos;re both having fun !  
yeah .  .  .   
 .  .  .  is it weird that it &apos;s not with each other ?  
yeah !  a little bit ,  yeah .  .  .  
 i think we need to talk .  .  .  !   
c &apos;mon guys ,  it &apos;ll be fun !  
all right ,  all right .  .  .  i &apos;ll play if we don &apos;t keep score !  
but then how do we know who wins ?

but can it .  .  .  just .  .  .  happen a little bit ?  
 no ,  no !  it can &apos;t happen at all !  
but why ,  why not ?  
because .  .  .  look ,  no one wants this to happen more than me ,  ok ?   i have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did i ever say no !   i couldn &apos;t do it to ross !  
but that wasn &apos;t gonna stop you before !  
i know ,  i know !  but i &apos;ve thought about it a lot since ,  and it just wouldn &apos;t be right .  .  .   i &apos;m sorry .  .  .  !

do you ?  
ah ,  yeah !  
do you ?  
ah ,  yeaaah !  
do you ?  
ah yeaaaah !  
 do you really find this attractive on him ?  
 oh ,  yeah !   are you telling me you .  .  .  you &apos;re not even .  .  .  a little turned on by monica ,  right now ?   
i think this is the first time in our marriage that i &apos;ve felt like the more attractive one .  
c &apos;mon mike ,  you can beat her !  knock that dog off her head !   
oh ,  damn it !  
 i sleep with him !  
 game ,  point !  
 don &apos;t get too cocky !  remember i won the last one !  oh ,  by the way ,  how did that feel ,  losing to a girl ?  
you know ,  you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that .   
no ,  no ,  nooo !  
and that &apos;s how it &apos;s done !   
okay - dokay ,  you &apos;ve each won a game and i &apos;ve lost what &apos;s felt like a year of my life .  so everybody goes home a winner .  
best out of three ?  
that &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking .  
should i use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil ?  
 serve the ball ,  chump !  
serve the ball ,  chump .  
i &apos;m just saying ,  i have a cabin in the adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city ,  well ,  that &apos;d be  just nifty !  
ooh ,  well .  ah ,  i kinda have got a lot on my plate right now ,  not that i wouldn &apos;t love a weekend in the country with a strange man .   
jarvis ?  
 oh ,  you &apos;re back .  .  .   this is my wife ,  nancy .  
get out !   
ross ,  can i talk to you for a minute ?  
yes ,  please !   so ,  what &apos;s going on ?  
uh ,  well .  .  .  joey and i broke up .  
oh my god ,  wh - what happened ?  
joey is a great guy ,  but we &apos;re just .  .  .  so different !  i mean ,  during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus !  
i knew that was him !  
anyway i just ,  uh ,  i think it &apos;s for the best .  
 hey ,  you ok ?  
i guess .  there was hum .  .  .   there was another reason that i thought it was time to end it with joey .  i started to realize that i was having feelings for someone  else .   
 ok geller .  last day of the conference ,  you know what happens to the keynote speaker .  
oh ,  professor clerk we &apos;re kind of in the middle of a conversation ,  here .  
yeah ,  can you guys just throw him in the pool later ?  
 ok ,  gentlemen !  please !  aren &apos;t we a little old for this ?  i mean ,  we &apos;re scientists ,  right ?  we &apos;re academics .  and most importantly i .  .  .  you - you will have to catch us first .   .  go ,  go ,  go !   
 
ok ,  so it &apos;s a tie again ,  41 to 41 .  
 ok ,  look !  enough is enough !  
no ,  i have just to have two more points to beat him !  
monica ,  that was also true an hour ago !  i mean ,  please ,  look at you !  your hand is blistered ,  you can barely stand ,  your hair is inexplicable !  ok ,  you &apos;ve already proven you are just as good as he is ,  now we &apos;ve missed our dinner reservations ,  so now let &apos;s just go upstairs ,  order room service ,  take a shower and shave your head !  
i can &apos;t just walk away !  i &apos;ve put in four hours !  
but .  .  .  
look !  you knew this about me when you married me !  you agreed to take me in sickness and in health .  well ,  this is my sickness !  
what about the obsessive cleaning ?  
that &apos;s just good sense !   
 aww !   
you ok ?  
no ,  no ,  no .  honey ,  i &apos;m ok .  shake it off !   oh ,  no !  no shaking ,  no shaking !  ooh !  ooh !   oh my god !  i can &apos;t play !

i can &apos;t believe it !   i lost !  
no ,  you didn &apos;t .  
what ?  
because i &apos;m gonna play for ya .  
you can &apos;t do that !  
oh ,  that &apos;s ok .  i don &apos;t care which of them i beat .  
ok ,  we &apos;re taking that paddle home ,  mister .  
 honey ,  you don &apos;t have to do this .  
 yes ,  i do .  now ,  i may not understand why you have to win so badly ,  but if it &apos;s important to you then it &apos;s important to me ,  because i love you .  
but .  .  .  you suck !  
 you &apos;re welcome ,  sweetheart .   
all right mike ,  let &apos;s get this over with .  sudden death .  whoever wins this point ,  wins .  
ok !   
oh my god !  you &apos;re good !

and that &apos;s .  .  .  how .  .  .  it &apos;s done !  
 oh my god .  that was so amazing !  when did you  hold on !  i almost forgot  loser !   when did you stop sucking ?  
i never sucked ,  i actually didn &apos;t want you to know how good i was !  
why ?  
i don &apos;t know .

i don &apos;t think they saw us .  
i don &apos;t think they did .   
hum ,  so ,  i started to say you something earlier ,  hum .  .  .   there was another reason i realized it was time to end it with joey .  i kind of realized i .  .  .  was starting to have feelings .  .  .  for someone else .  
 oh .  can i .  .  .  can i ask who ?  
i think you know .  
i think i know too but i &apos;ve been really wrong about this stuff in the past ,  so .  .  .   
i &apos;m sorry .  .  .  we .  .  .  we can &apos;t .  
all right ,  all right .  
i mean ,  you just went out with my best friend ,  and i just think it &apos;d be a really really bad idea .   or - or not !    
oh ,  the way you crushed mike at ping pong was such a turn - on . you wanna .  .  .  ?

oh ,  ju - ju - just stay calm .  just be calm .  for all he knows we &apos;re just hanging out together .  right ?  just be nonchalant .   that &apos;s not nonchalant !  
no idea what it means .  
oh .  .  .  okay ,  just hide !  
 rach ?  
coming !  try under the bed ,  try under the bed !   
there &apos;s no room under the bed .

yeah .  .  .   
hey .  
hi .  .  .  
you know where joey is ?  
 .  .  . i really don &apos;t .  .  .   
can i talk to you for a minute ?  
yeah ,  sure .  .  .    
i don &apos;t believe this .  .  .  have you guys been .  .  .  
shhh .  .  .  this is the listening side of the wall .   
and then she told me that she and joey had broken up ,  and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me .  
 uh - huh .  .  .  right .  .  .  yeah .  .  .  
and you know i wanted to ask charlie out since the day i met her .  
 oh ,  i know .  .  .  i know it &apos;s been really hard for you .  
anyway ,  one thing lead to another ,  and .  .  .  oh .  .  .  before you know it ,  we were kissing .  i mean ,  how angry do you think joey is gonna be ?  
 that is hard to say ,  ross .  that is hard to say .  
you know ,  i gotta go find him .  he &apos;s gotta be here someplace .  
you would think !   
joey !  
is he gone ?  
 how are you doing this ?   
pssst .  .  .  
how .  .  .  wha .  .  .  hey !  what are you .  .  .  what is this ?  have you guys been listening this entire time ?  
now ,  what is this ?  
ah ,  what is this ?  well ,  lets see ,  we kissed for ten minutes and now we &apos;re talking to our friends about it ,  so i guess this is sixth grade !  
oh no .  .  .  have you thought about it how complicated this could get ?  what about ross ?  
well ,  he &apos;s with charlie now .  
yeah ,  but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her .  and as his friend ,  i mean ,  don &apos;t you think he deserves the same from you ?  
 you &apos;re a pain in my ass ,  geller !  
all right ,  look you guys .  .  .  look ,  we appreciate all the advice ,  but this is between joey and me and i think we can handle it .  .  .  
okay ,  well we &apos;ll go back in there ,  but will you do one thing for us ?  the people that care about you ?  
sure .  .  .  
enunciate !  
get out !   
are they right ?  
probably ,  yeah .  .  .  i mean ,  maybe we should .  .  .  hold off until we talk to ross .  
yeah .  .  .  yeah ,  we can wait ,  we don &apos;t have to do anything tonight .  
yeah ,  i think that &apos;d be best .  .  .  so ,  so i &apos;m gonna .  .  .  i &apos;m gonna take off .  .  .

i thought so .  
and listen to this .  .  .   
whoo ,  whoo .  wow ,  it &apos;s uhm .  .  .  kinda weird that i &apos;m sitting next to charlie after we broke up .  
yeah ,  it &apos;s almost if air barbados doesn &apos;t care about your social life .  
look ,  does someone mind switching to sit with charlie ?  
oh ,  i uh ,  i mean ,  i .  .  .  dude ,  i spent the whole conference with charlie .  
i understand .  .  .  
no ,  i &apos;ll do it .   
wish i could switch with someone .  i really don &apos;t wanna sit with allen iverson over there .   
uhm .  .  .  you know ,  once we &apos;re in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign .  .  .  you feel free to roam about my cabin .  .  .  
you should be careful when checking your overhead bins ,   &apos;cause items may shift during .  .  .  
aaah .  .  .  you &apos;re not good at this .  .  .  
you don &apos;t have to go home tonight ,  do you ?  
no ,  i think i can come over .  it &apos;s saturday ,  right ?  
oh .  .  .  
what ?  
uhm .  .  .  i can &apos;t do anything tonight .  
why not ?  
i have a date .  
you have a .  .  .  you have a date ?  with who ?  
oh ,  it &apos;s .  .  .  my girlfriend .  
 you have .  .  .  have a girlfriend ?  
yeah .  .  .  well ,  when .  .  .  you and i broke up i started seeing someone .  
for how long ?  
three months .  
three months ?  okay .  .  .  this is probably none of my business ,  but uhm ,  how long do you think you &apos;re gonna keep seeing her ?  
i &apos;ll tell her that it &apos;s over tonight at dinner .  i promise .  
oh ,  okay .  .  .  good .  you do that .  and then when you get home ,  maybe there &apos;ll be a special delivery package waiting for you .  
maybe i &apos;ll sign for it .  tear it open .  pull out the packing material .  .  .  
you know what ,  we &apos;re gonna have sex .  let &apos;s just leave it there .   
right ,  i &apos;m gonna go talk to joey .  i think this is the right time .  he &apos;s always in a good mood after the flight attendant says  &quot; duty free &quot;  .  
okay .  .  .  good luck .   
ross is coming over .  i think now would be a really good time to talk to him .  
i guess so .  i &apos;m just .  .  .  really nervous .  
okay ,  well keep in mind that by the time you &apos;re done ,  they &apos;ll probably be serving dinner .  
ooh .  .  .

excuse me !   you didn &apos;t tell him ,  did you ?  
i couldn &apos;t .  he was saying all these really nice things about me .  i didn &apos;t want him to get mad and take  &apos;em all back .  i &apos;m on a edge on chandler .  
oh god !  alright ,  fine .  you know what joey ,  forget it .  when we go back to new york ,  i will tell him .  
hi ,  mike &apos;s place .  
hey ,  it &apos;s mike .  
ooh ,  that was fast .  
oh ,  err .  .  .  no ,  she &apos;s not here yet .  you know ,  i think i &apos;m just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone .  .  .  
yeah ,  you can &apos;t do that !  oh ,  come on mike ,  strap on a pair . why don &apos;t you just tell her that we got back together .  you know ,  women appreciate honesty .  we also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while .  just f . y . i .  
one more thing .  .  .  there .  .  .  might be a picture of precious on my coffee table .  
her name is precious ?  is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound ?  
anyway ,  i just wanna give you a heads up .  
okay ,  oh and you know ,  if she gets upset ,  just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout .    
hi ,  i &apos;m precious ,  who are you ?  
 i .  .  .  i &apos;m phoebe .  
phoebe ?  mike &apos;s ex - girlfriend phoebe ,  the love of his life ?  that phoebe ?  
oh ,  i can &apos;t wait for everyone at work to see these .  .  .   ow !  
you go back to work tomorrow night ,  right ?  
yeah !  
so if you want people to see them ,  then by definition you &apos;re not having them taken out .  .  .  say ,  at the break of dawn ?  
well ,  if i had them taken out ,  then i wouldn &apos;t be able to do this .   you like that ,  right ?   
what are you singing ?  
it &apos;s  &quot; bolero &quot;  from  &quot; 10 &quot;  .  
it &apos;s  &quot; ride of the valkyries &quot;  from  &quot; apocalypse now &quot;  .  .  .  hair problem .  and now that we &apos;re home ,  we don &apos;t have that problem anymore ,  so if you think about it .  .  .  i hate them !  
you what ?  you said you liked them .  
did i ?  let &apos;s refresh .  i believe what i said was that i could see your scalp .  
fine ,  so you don &apos;t like them .  everybody else does .  
again ,  let &apos;s journey back .  .  .  as i recall what rachel said ,  was she had never notice the shape of your skull before .  and joey .  .  .  well ,  joey didn &apos;t realise that there was anything different .  
you know what ?  i don &apos;t care .  i like it like this ,  and i &apos;m gonna keep it .  you &apos;re just jealous because your hair can &apos;t do this .  .  .   ouch !  
hit yourself in the tooth ?  
 hi .  .  .  there she is .  hi emma .  oh my god ,  i missed you .   oh emma ,  i missed you so much .  hey .  .  .  did you have a good time with grandma green ?  huh ?  did she give you a bottle of anti - depressants again to use as a rattle ?   
that was one time ,  ross ,  and they were only like 5 milligrams .  
ooh hey ,  emma ,  daddy has some presents for you okay ?  okay ?  i want you to wait right here .  come here sweetie .  
aaah .  .  .  ross ,  actually there &apos;s something that i really need to talk to you about .  
 okay ,  shoot !  
okay ,  uhm .  .  .  alright ,  here &apos;s the deal .  
 oh no !  
what ?  what is it ?  
oh ,  major shampoo explosion !  
uh ,  look ross ,  this really isn &apos;t easy .  
oh ,  it &apos;s all over everything .  why ?  why me ?   
because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo ?  
i &apos;m sorry ,  i &apos;m sorry .  you were saying ?  
well ,  yeah .  .  .  okay ,  look it &apos;s about me and .  .  .  
oh ,  not another one !  oh my g .  .  .  and this is moisturiser .  it &apos;s even harder to clean !  why ?  why do bad things happen to good people ?  
wow !  well ,  clearly this is not a good time .  
okay ,  bye .  alright ,  so mike &apos;s on his way over .  see ,  you thought you guys were meeting here ,  and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant ,  so you know .  .  .  doesn &apos;t really matter who &apos;s right or wrong .  point is .  .  .  i &apos;m gonna take off .  
i &apos;m not letting you leave until you tell me what &apos;s going on here .  i mean ,  are you guys getting back together or something ?  
alright .  .  .  susie ,  can i call you susie ?  
my name is precious .  
yeah ,  i can &apos;t say that .  uhm .  .  .  susie ,  i &apos;m gonna be straight with you .  .  .  mike and i are back together .  .  .  and uhm .  .  .  unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him .  and he &apos;s very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours .  
i just can &apos;t believe this .  .  .  why ?  
well ,  i don &apos;t .  .  .  
oh ,  why would he do this ?  i mean ,  what &apos;s wrong with me ?  
nothing ,  there &apos;s nothing wrong with you .  
i mean ,  what the hell am i supposed to do now ?  
damn it woman ,  pull yourself together !  have some pride ,  for the love of god .   
okay ,  not a fan of the tough love .  
i just can &apos;t believe that mike didn &apos;t give me any warning .  
but he didn &apos;t really know ,  you know .  he wasn &apos;t planning on coming to barbados and proposing to me .  .  .  
he proposed to you ?  this is the worst birthday ever .   
look ,  precious .  .  .  mike &apos;s not worth this .  you &apos;re an attractive ,  intelligent woman and let &apos;s face it ,  mike &apos;s kind of a wang .  i mean ,  he proposed to me while he was still seeing you .  .  .  he was gonna break - up with you on your birthday ?  and ,  i don &apos;t like to kiss - and - tell ,  but he cheated on you a lot this weekend .  
oh ,  my god ,  maybe you &apos;re right .  maybe i don &apos;t need him .  i deserve to be treated with respect .   
screw you ,  mike .  you &apos;re a coward and a bastard ,  and i hope you rot in hell .   
honey ,  you &apos;ve been in there for a long time .  .  .  is everything okay ?  
not really .   
i have a problem .  
really ?  what happened ?  
well ,  i was dancing around ,  and singing  &quot; no woman ,  no cry &quot;  and i got stuck .  
you can &apos;t move at all ?  
oh ,  well ,  i can move .  .  .   
if i untangle you ,  will you please get rid of the corn rose ?  
 i guess so .  .  .  
 some of these look a little frayed .  
hey !  
hi !  
so ,  did you err .  .  .  did you tell ross ?  
well ,  i tried ,  but then he had a shampoo related emergency .  so i guess now it &apos;s your turn again .  
no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no .  .  .  i think it &apos;s better if you tell him ,  you know .  it &apos;s easier for a woman .  that way ,  you know ,  if he gets mad ,  all you have to do is go .  .  .  i didn &apos;t mean it .  i &apos;m so so -  - ooory .   
yeah ,   &apos;cause that &apos;s what we do .  
alright ,  alright ,  okay ,  uhm .  .  .  how  &apos;bout this ,  how about this ?  tomorrow .  .  .  tomorrow we &apos;ll both go and we &apos;ll tell him together .  
okay ,  that sounds fair .  it just means that once again we can &apos;t .  .  .  
i know ,  i know .  .  .  ,  but that &apos;s okay .  i mean ,  we can control ourselves ,  we &apos;re not animals .  
no !  of course we can wait .  alright ,  so i guess that means good night then ?  
yeah !  good night !   
goo -  - ood night !  
good night !   
seriously ,  good night !  
stop saying good night .  
look what i found in the drawer .  .  .   and you said i &apos;d never wear this .  .  .  
now that i untangled you ,  how  &apos;bout you doing a little something for me ?  
sure ,  what do you have in mind ?  
i think you know .  
really ?  i don &apos;t really feel like it .  
this is what i want to do .  
okay ,  i just don &apos;t get why you like it so much .  
 she &apos;s an fbi agent ,  posing as a beauty contestant .   with ross seeing joey and rachel kissing .  rosss tares at them . ] 
okay ,  ross ,  i realise that you didn &apos;t expect to walk in and see that ,  but .  .  let me explain ,  okay ?  
we weren &apos;t doing anything !  
rach ,  he just saw us .  
shhh .  
but what you saw ,  that is the extent of it ,  okay ?  one kiss .  
no ,  come on ,  that is a lie .  we also kissed in barbados .  okay ,  we also kissed in barbados ,  but we didn &apos;t plan it ,  okay ?  and the only reason that that happened was because i saw you kissing charlie .  
yeah ,  you started it !  i &apos;ve got to chill .  
look ,  we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened ,  but .  .  
we feel so terrible about this ,  ross .  
yeah ,  but it did happen ,  so .  .  .   
ross ?  
ross ,  say something .  anything .  
so you two are .  .  ?  
and have you  .  .  ed ?  
no ,  no ,  no !  
no ,  no ,  no !  
but if i hadn &apos;t walked in here ,  would you .  .  ?  
probably .   
no ,  no !  
ross ,  this is not how we wanted you to find out about this .  you have every right to go nuts .  
i &apos;m not going nuts .  do you see me go nuts ?  
no ,  but you know what i mean .  
hey ,  hey ,  hey .  .  .  if you two are happy ,  then i &apos;m happy for you .   i &apos;m fine !  
really ?  
absolutely .   i &apos;m fine !  totally fine .  i don &apos;t know why it &apos;s coming out all loud and squeaky ,   &apos;cause really ,   i &apos;m fine .  i &apos;m not saying i wasn &apos;t a little surprised to see you guys kissing .  i mean ,  at first i was like .  .   but now that i &apos;ve had time to absorb it; lovin &apos; this .  
ross .  .  
it &apos;s all working out !  me & charlie ,  and you two .  you know what we should do ?  
calm ourselves ?  
no .  we should all have dinner .  yes ,  we &apos;ll do it tomorrow night .  i &apos;ll cook !  !  
look ,  don &apos;t you think that will be a little weird ?  
weird ?  what ?  what &apos;s weird ?  the only thing weird would be if someone didn &apos;t like mexican food ,  because i &apos;m making fajitas !  !   
god ,  this adoption stuff is so overwhelming .  there &apos;s inter - country adoption ,  dependency adoption .  .  there are so many ways to go ,  and this is like the biggest decision of our lives .

oh my god ,  frank ,  are you thinking of leaving ?  because i didn &apos;t have those triplets so you could just run out on them !  that .  no .  i just was thinking that ,  you know ,  maybe you could take one .  
thank you so much for seeing us .  phoebe has told us such great things about you guys .  
oh ,  please ,  we &apos;re happy to help .  
we went through the same thing when we were adopting .  
so ,  a lot of malfunctioning wee - wees and hoo - hoos in this room ,  huh ?   
i mean ,  you have a lovely home .  
well ,  we appreciate anything you can tell us .  
well ,  actually ,  i think this might help .   
it &apos;s pretty much all the information you need .  
oh my god !  
everything is broken down into categories ,  and then cross - referenced ,  and then colour - coded to correspond with the forms in the back .  
thank you .   i think i just had a tiny orgasm .  
i know the process is frustrating ,  but it &apos;s so worth it .  adopting owen was the best thing that ever happened to us .  
that &apos;s great .   can i see the book ?   
you want me to wash my hands first ,  don &apos;t you ?  
it &apos;s .  .  it &apos;s just so pretty and white .  
the bathroom is down the hall ,  to your left .   
i would have told him to do it too .  
can i adopt you ?   
hey ,  you must be owen .  
yeah .  
i &apos;m chandler .  hey ,  i was in the scouts too .  
you were ?  
yeah ,  in fact my father was a den - mother .  
huh ?  
you know how to use a compass ?  
i have a badge in it .  
you do ?  that &apos;s fantastic !  
you wanna see it ?  
i &apos;d love to ,  but i gotta get back to talking to your parents .  they &apos;re telling us all about how they adopted you .  
what ?  !  ?  
what ?  
i &apos;m adopted ?   
the first batch of margaritas was not so great ,  but the second batch is gooooood .  
well ,  maybe the next batch ,  we could all get some .  
oh ,  guys ,  this is fun ,  isn &apos;t it ?  you know ?  just the four of us .  just hangin &apos; .  
dude ,  are you okay ?  and when are the fajitas gonna be ready ?  
i &apos;m fine !  hey ,  i &apos;m great !  i &apos;m just .  .  i &apos;m just proud of us .  there &apos;s no weirdness ,  no tension .  
no awareness .  
we make a great foursome .  we should do more stuff together .  ooh !  let &apos;s take a trip .  okay ,  where do you think we  -  we can go ?   
my fajitas !  !   
look ,  charlie ,  i just want you to know .  ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of joey and me .  you know ,  he normally doesn &apos;t drink like this .  
oh ,  you know what ?  this is nothing .  my father is a raging alcoholic .   
oh ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  have i made this evening uncomfortable ?   
fajitas !  be careful ,  very hot plate ,  very hot plate !  !  
ross ,  you don &apos;t even have oven mitts on !   
okay ,  well ,  this is crazy .  can &apos;t seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids ,  can we ?  
insane .  
alice would never go for it ,  right ?  tired ,  too ,  i think we &apos;ve got her onboard .  
well ,  just you know ,  for argument &apos;s sake ,  you know ,  hypothetically .  which one would you be willing to give up ?  
frank jr . jr .  ?  good one .  i mean ,  you know ,  he &apos;s really funny .  like ,  the other day he made up this joke .  
uh - huh .  i &apos;m a frog &quot;  ?  a talking frog !   oh ,  no ,  you can &apos;t have him ,  he &apos;s too funny .  
well ,  alright ,  that &apos;s fine .  what about leslie ?  she &apos;s ,  she &apos;s the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet .  
alright ,  so that leaves chandler .  chandler ,  no .  no ,  no .  she &apos;s my little genius .  i got big hopes for her .  she &apos;s gonna be a doctor or a realtor .  .  
wow ,  frank .  i think we just ran out of kids .  oh ,  wow .  phoebe ,  i don &apos;t think i can give one of them up .  i mean ,  you know ,  they drive me crazy ,  but they &apos;re my babies .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  frank .  i didn &apos;t realise things were so bad .  you know ,  i &apos;ll help out more .  i can  -  i can babysit any time you want .  you name the day ,  and i &apos;ll be there .  
well ,  that &apos;s not good .  but you know ,  i can move some stuff around ,  and i &apos;ll be there .  you and alice just take the whole day together .  
where are bill and colleen ?  
they &apos;re in the kitchen getting something to eat .  can you believe how nice they are ?  
we have to leave !  !  
why ?  what did you do in the bathroom ?  
i didn &apos;t get to the bathroom .  i bumped into owen on the way ,  and he didn &apos;t know he was adopted .  and there &apos;s a slight chance i may have told him .  
oh my god ,  where &apos;s my purse ?  no ,  you know what ?  i can replace everything in there .  get that binder ,  and let &apos;s go !   
hey .  
some little snacks for everybody .  oh ,  you don &apos;t have to eat the sour worms .  those are for owen .  
i &apos;ll go get him in a second .  by the way ,  you should know we haven &apos;t told him he &apos;s adopted yet .  
but kids are so intuitive .  don &apos;t you think on some level he already knows ?   
i &apos;m adopted ?  !  
see ?  intuitive !  
what ?  where did you hear that ?  
he told me !  and he paid me 50 dollars not to tell .  
which technically now you should give back !  
you told him he &apos;s adopted ?  
i &apos;m so sorry ,  but you should have a sign out there or something .  or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door .   &quot; owen doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s adopted ,  and he also thinks that santa is real .  &quot;  
everyone ?  i would like to make a toast to rachel and joey .  
ooy .  
and to love .  ah ,  love .  l - o - v - e ,  love .  l is for life .  and what is life without love ?  
oh my god ,  are we supposed to answer ?  
o is for  &quot; oh ,  wow !  &quot;  the v is for this very surprising turn of events ,  which i &apos;m still fine with by the way .  e is for how extremely normal i find it .  that you two are together .  and now one day you might get married and have children of your own .   
dude ,  are you okay ?  
totally .  
ross ,  you don &apos;t seem okay .  it must be the pressure of entertaining .  i think everyone would feel better if we had some flan .  
wait ,  ross .  ross .  i  -  i have to take off .  
no !  
i &apos;m sorry ,  i have a really early class in the morning ,  but this has been lovely .  
wasn &apos;t it ?  and you thought it would be awkward with joey and that you never really liked rachel .  
you &apos;re on fire !  i &apos;ll call you in the morning ,  okay ?  
okay .  
alright .   
god ,  rachel ,  what ross just said that is just so .  .  
oh ,  that &apos;s okay ,  girls tend not to like me .  
bye .   
okay ,  i guess it &apos;s just flan for three !  hey ,  hey ,  that rhymed !  
you know what ,  ross ?  i think we &apos;re gonna take off too .  
oh ,  oh .  of course .  god ,  i &apos;m so stupid .  you guys are a couple now .  i mean ,  you probably just want to be alone .  
no ,  no ,  it &apos;s just that it &apos;s getting late .  .  .  
hey ,  hey ,  it &apos;s fine .  it &apos;s totally fine .  we &apos;ve got plenty of margaritas .  it &apos;s all good .   
i don &apos;t even know what that &apos;s for .   
you know what ?  i think i &apos;m gonna stay here and make sure he &apos;s okay .  
yeah ,  that &apos;s probably a good idea .  
yeah .  i &apos;ll see you in the morning .  
uh - huh .  okay .  you know what ,  joey ,  i don &apos;t think he &apos;s ever gonna be okay with this .  
morning .  here you go .  
thanks .  did you stay here all night ?  
yeah .  
so you took off my pants and shoes ?  
no ,  no ,  no .  you actually did that when you were dancing to the chicago - soundtrack .  look ,  ross ,  about ,  about rachel and i .  listen ,  you don &apos;t have to worry about that ,  okay ?  because nothing is gonna happen .  
what do you mean ?  
well ,  she and i said from the beginning that we weren &apos;t gonna do anything unless you were okay with it .  and clearly .  .  
hey ,  what are you talking about ?  i &apos;m fine !  
it &apos;s okay ,  ross ,  alright ?  i totally understand .  of course you &apos;re not fine .  you &apos;re .  .  you &apos;re ross and rachel .  
except we &apos;re not .  i mean ,  we haven &apos;t been a couple in like ,  six years .  oh my god ,  is that right ?  has it been that long ?  
that &apos;s what i hear ,  yeah .  
this is crazy .  i mean ,  six years ?  and because of me you guys aren &apos;t gonna be together ?  can i ask you something ?  really ,  what is this thing with you and rachel ?  
come on ,  i mean ,  you know me ,  you know .  .  .  
joey .  
i &apos;m crazy about her .  
and she feels the same way ?  
i think so .  
well ,  then ,  maybe it &apos;s time we all moved on .  
yeah ,  but ,  ross ,  i mean ,  you &apos;re not okay with it .  
no ,  but i wanna be .  hey ,  i will be .  besides ,  i &apos;m with charlie ,  right ?  oh my god ,  i &apos;m still with charlie ,  aren &apos;t i ?  i mean ,  she didn &apos;t see the dance ,  did she ?

no ,  no ,  no .  .  .  no ,  i mean .  .  .  se - x - u - ally .  .  .  
yeah ,  was there a part of you that .  .  .  felt like it was .  .  .  really wrong ?  
actually ,  no .  no ,  it felt right .  you know ,  it felt like uhm .  .  .  i can &apos;t believe we haven &apos;t been doing this the whole time .   
i can tell from your expressions that that &apos;s the good news you were hoping for .  .  .  well ,  i &apos;m gonna go continue to .  .  .  spread the joy .  
well ,  just because it happened that way for them doesn &apos;t mean it has to happen that way for us .  
yeah ,  yeah .  .  .  absolutely .  i mean ,  just because something &apos;s difficult doesn &apos;t mean that you quit .  
right ,  totally .  
yeah ,  so we just keep trying and trying until we .  .  .  do it .  
yeah ,  and if doesn &apos;t work ,  then we &apos;ll be just one of those couples that never have sex .  
that &apos;s a .  .  .  pla - an .   
 wow .  .  .  i did not see this coming .  
i know .  
i don &apos;t get it .  i mean ,  i was so sure this was what i wanted .  
hmmm .  .  .  me too .  .  .   
i wonder how monica and chandler could do it ?  
i guess they weren &apos;t as good friends as we are .   
aah .  .  .  i bet you &apos;re right .   
so .  .  .  
yeah .  
i love ya .  
love you too .  .  .  alright ,  i &apos;m going to bed .  
yeah ,  me too .   
ooh ,  yeah ,  i &apos;m not going anywhere for a while .   ending credits 
 
dude ,  it &apos;s chandler .  let me in .   
go away !  i don &apos;t want to see anybody .  
i know ,  i went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me .  you have to let me in .  
really ?  did you count mississipily ?   
dude ,  you &apos;re not tanned .  
no ,  i just had to get a picture of this .   
 hey guys !  ross ,  rachel 
honey ,  i got us that room at the woodford inn this weekend .  
that place in vermont ?  you can take a hint !  
wait ,  you can &apos;t go away this weekend !  it &apos;s emma &apos;s birthday !  
yeah !  
we &apos;re having a party .  
well ,  can &apos;t you just have the party when we get back ?  
no .  
no ,  that day .  .  .  that won &apos;t be her real birthday !  
gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was !  
c &apos;mon you guys ,  this is really important to us .  
well ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  but chandler and i could really use a weekend away .  you know ,  to reconnect .  .  .  emotionally .  
there &apos;s this thing i really want us to do .  i read about it in maxim .  .  .  
well ,  can &apos;t you just go to vermont the next day ?  
yeah ,  we want everyone to be there .  as much as i hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister .  
and i mean ,  you know ,  you guys .  .  .  this is a big deal .  i mean ,  how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle !  
all right ,  we &apos;ll stay .  we can just drive up after the party .  
fine ,  but if we end up not doing this maxim thing because of this party .  .  .  
you know pheebs ,  when i was little ,  on my birthday ,  my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house ,  and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find  &apos;em all .  
oooh ,  i love family traditions like that .  when uhm .  .  .  when ursula and i were kids ,  on our birthday ,  our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food !  
 hey guys !  rachel 
hey ,  i brought the camera for emma &apos;s video .  
oh ,  good ,  good !  we had this idea to make a birthday video for emma and we &apos;ll give it to her when she is 18 .  
oh ,  cool !  !  wow ,  it &apos;s like a time capsule !  
yeah !  
oh ,  just think .  .  .  she &apos;s gonna be watching that video on a tv that hasn &apos;t even been invented yet !  with friends who right now are just like babies !  and they &apos;ll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people !  
that &apos;s the hope !  so ,  is emma awake yet ?  
oh no ,  it &apos;s still nap time .  but she &apos;ll be up soon .  
ah ,  and where is joey ?  
i said it &apos;s still nap time .   
 hey ,  there is uncle joey !  
hey !  
hey ,  say something to emma on her 18th birthday !  
18 ,  uh ?   
joey ,  no !  
what ,  what !  ?  it &apos;s for her hot friends !  
when they see this you &apos;ll be 52 !  
and starting to think about settling down !  
hey joey ,  will you please set this up for people to put emma &apos;s presents on ?  
i &apos;d love to !  yeah !  
 we were supposed to bring presents ?  
yeah !  i wrote emma a song .  
oh ,  yeah !  how was i supposed to know ?  
joey ,  it &apos;s a birthday party .  
yeah ,  but for a one - year - old .  what &apos;s the point .  .  .  the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup .  just a cup with a picture of elmo on it dressed as a farmer .  and he &apos;s standing next to this cow and the cow says  &quot; el - moo &quot;  !   yeah .  .  .  that &apos;s a funny cup !   
hey !  
hey hey !  where &apos;s the birthday girl ?  
oh ,  she &apos;s still napping 
oh ,  sure ,  she was probably up all night ,  excited about the party she knows is happening .  
look ,  i know that you guys really want to get to vermont and this isn &apos;t a really big deal to you ,  but it really is to us ,  ok ?  emma will never have a first birthday again .  
all right .  .  .  you &apos;re right .  we &apos;re sorry .  now let &apos;s wake up emma and get the fun time started !  
no really ,  she didn &apos;t sleep well last night ,  so we can &apos;t wake her up .  
are you freaking kidding me ,  green ?   jack and 
hi !  
 hey !  
so glad you came !  
i can &apos;t believe emma is already one !  
 i remember your first birthday !  ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you .  he pulled on his testicles so hard !  we had to take him to the emergency room !  
 there &apos;s something you didn &apos;t know about your dad !  
hey mr .  and mrs . _geller !  let me help you with that .  
thank you !  
oh man ,  this is great ,  uh ?  the three of us together again !  you know what would be fun ?  if we gave this present to emma from all of us !  
which one are you ?   
i can &apos;t believe emma is still asleep !  
i know ,  what are we gonna do ?  
i &apos;ve got a plan .  i &apos;ve got a plan .  i &apos;m going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs .  you &apos;re gonna scream out and that &apos;ll wake her up !  
i &apos;m not going to vermont with this monica !  
hey pheebs ,  you know what ?  i was thinking .  .  .  since you wrote a song ,  maybe i could do something for emma using my talents !  
so youre gonna .  .  .  hit on her ?  
no ,  no ,  no !  my talents as an actor !  
oh !  
you know ,  i could like maybe .  .  .  i could do a dramatic reading of one of her books !  
or you could stick a fork in an apple !  
hey ,  i think emma might like it !  
oh !  emma might like what ?  
um ,  my present !  
what did you get her ?  
actually we prepared performances .  
separate performances .  
but equally real !  
well ,  this sounds like fun !  well ,  you know what ?  actually ?  people are getting a little antsy waiting emma to wake up from her nap ,  so would you mind performing them once now ?  
sure ,  yeah !  
 o k .  
 all right ,  lets get this party started ,  huh ?  joey and phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us .  
oh ,  great !  
 are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared ?  
hey ,  i do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting !  
so ,  joey ,  what are you gonna do for us ?  
i will be doing a dramatic reading of one of emmas books .  
oh ,  ok ,  which one ?  
uh ,  why ,  its a .  .  .   one of her favorites ,  uh ,   riding the storm out .  coping with post - partum depression eesh !   love you forever .  love you forever .  by robert munsch .  published by firefly books .  printed  in mexico .  a mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth ,  back and forth ,  back and forth ,  and while she held him she sang ill love you forever ,  ill like you for always ,  as long as i &apos;m living ,  my baby youll be .   .  and while he rocked her ,  he sang ill love you forever ,  ill like you for always ,  as long as i &apos;m living ,  my baby youll be .  
 wow !  that was amazing !  
thank you so much for that gift !  chandler 
amazing .  .  .  amazing .  
oh ,  phoebe ,  im sorry !  phoebe has prepared something as well .  
thats right ,  i &apos;ve prepared a song for emma .  from my heart to hers .  for theres no greater gift ,  than the gift of music .   emma !  your name poses a dilemma .   &apos;cause not much else rhymes with emma !  maybe the actor richard crenna ,  he played the commanding officer in rambo .  happy birthday emma !  
is that it ?  
no ,  of course not !  i also ,  you know ,  prepared a reading  .  sex and the single mother .   finding your g - spot .  
hello emma .  happy eighteenth birthday .  
right now that seems so far away ,  seventeen years .  
yes ,  youll be all grown up by then .  well be .  .  .  well your grandfather and i might not be here .  
thats true !  this message could becoming to you from beyond the grave ,  emma !  
after all ,  my parents died very young .  
and my cholesterols off the charts !  
remember ,  emma ,  heart disease kills women too !  ross (stops

oh ,  you &apos;re gonna love this cake .  i got it from a bakery in new jersey ,  corinos .  
oh my god ,  that place has the creamiest frosting !  i use to hitchhike there when i was a kid .  
well ,  anyway ,  they make these great novelty cakes ,  in all different shapes ,  and if you give them a photo ,  theyll copy it in icing !  
oh ,  did you do a picture of emma ?  
yes !  on a cake shaped like a bunny .  
uh ,  rach ?  does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes ?  say for bachelorette parties ?  
ross ,  what are you talking about ?   oh !  oh my god !  they put my babys face on a penis !  phoebe 
why you guys this isn &apos;t funny ,  all right ?  if i wanted this cake to be a disaster i would have baked it myself !  joey (staring looks delicious ?  
jack ,  look at this .  
i know what you &apos;re thinking judy ,  the resemblance is uncanny !  
i am this close to tugging on my testicles again .  rachel ok ?  i went all the way to new jersey so that i could have the perfect cake for my daughters birthday and i need a bunny cake ,  right now !  
ask them if it would be faster if we cut the babys face off the penis ,  so we can put it on the bunny .   .  that is a weird sentence !  
oh !  believe you me !  i am going to bring this cake back ,  i don &apos;t even want it in my home .  .  .   joey ,  don &apos;t touch it !  !  
i &apos;m so confused !  
 yes ,  yes .  i still want my daughters picture ,  but on a bunny cake .  yellow cake ,  chocolate frosting with nuts !  
to be fair this one does have nuts .    
hey mon ,  that was really nice of you to loan rachel your car so she could go and get the cake .  
oh .  so nice of her to pull my hair ,   &apos;till i dropped the key !  
well ,  you know what ?  while we &apos;re waiting ,  you guys could tape your message to emma for her 18th birthday ,  huh ?   ok !  
hi emma !  it &apos;s the year 2020 .  are you still enjoying your nap ?  
we &apos;re aunt monica and uncle chandler ,  by the way .  you may not recognize us ,  because we haven &apos;t spoken to your parents in seventeen years !

well ,  oh ,  ok now .  .  .  only one of us has to stay with emma .  ok ,  and as the person who realized that ,  i get to go !

oh !  i got it !  ok ,  everyone pick a number from one to ten .  alright ?  whoever gets the highest number gets to go first .  
 ok ,  ten .  
okay ,  monica picks ten ,  i call nine !  anyone else ?

i &apos;m begging you stop .  
right .  
her birthday .  we can make them race ,  and whoever comes in last ,  stays !  
 yeah !  !  let &apos;s do that !

everybody get your toys !   
ok !  i want the dolphin !  
thats a bear .  
i &apos;m too excited !  
phoebe ,  you get the bear ,  uhm ,  joey ,  you get the robot ,  and chandler and i get the dog .  ok ,  and the race is going to go  from here to here .  now the one who comes in last ,  stays !

good job alan !  
hey ,  good race you guys .  
yeah ,  see you later !

they left .   the freeway .  rachel is driving monica &apos;s porsche ,  while using her mobile phone .  ross is sitting next to her . ] 
 no ,  there isn &apos;t time to go to the bakery .  we &apos;re just gonna come home .  .  .  everybody left ?  alright ,  well just tell emma we &apos;re gonna be there as soon as we can .   bye .  .  .   
rachel !  
ooh !  god !  sorry !  
 i can &apos;t believe they gave you a ticket .  you &apos;re such a good driver .   
emma &apos;s awake .  
yeah ?  
i can &apos;t believe this .  this is her first birthday .  she &apos;s awake .  we &apos;re not even there .  everybody left .  we still have this stupid obscene cake .  
hey ,  maybe i can fix that ,  you know .  try to turn it into something else .   
oh ,  why do you even bother ?  i already ruined her first birthday .  .  .  and do you know how important these early experiences are ross ?  very !  according to the back cover of that book that you gave me .  
rach ,  she &apos;s not going to remember this .  
 i guess .  .  .  oh ,  i just had such an idea of what this day would be like ,  you know ?  emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing  &quot; happy birthday &quot;  .  then we would all go into .  .  .  hey get out of the road you stupid student driver !  !  !   they have to learn !  
 hey !  
what ?  
it &apos;s not bad .  
 oh my god !  look what .  .  .  you made it into a bunny .  how did you do that ?  
well ,  i just made these two things uhm .  .  .  cheeks .  and then i split this to make ears .  
well ,  i &apos;m very impressed .  
some can sing ,  some can dance .  i apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures .  rachel and joey &apos;s apartment .  chandler ,  monica and emma are sitting on the floor ,  and emma &apos;s stuffed animals are lined up in front of them . ] 
now another way to organise your stuffed animals ,  is by size .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  is this a game for emma or for monica ?  
game ?  
emma ,  you even know it &apos;s your birthday today ?  you &apos;re one !  one - year - old ,  that &apos;s little .   
ooh !  that &apos;s my girl !  
that &apos;s how old you are .  
did i teach her that ?  did i just .  .  .  impart wisdom ?  
 ooh ,  i want one .  .  .  
me too .  .  .   
there &apos;s no - one around .  why don &apos;t we just take this one ?  
 .  .  . and head to canada !  
i was kidding .  
i wasn &apos;t .  let &apos;s get going !   
hey ,  are ross and rachel back ?  
no ,  not yet .  
oh good ,  i didn &apos;t miss the party .  
what about your massage client ?  
i just felt so bad ,  missing this .  so i just slipped him a little something ,  you know .  as long as i &apos;m back in five or six hours ,  it will be alright .   
okay ,  if ross and rachel ask ,  i &apos;ve been here the whole time .  the whole time !   
 i &apos;ve been here the whole time !  
joey ,  we just saw you come in .  you ran past us on the stairs .  
i don &apos;t care that you left .  i &apos;m just glad that you &apos;re here .  thanks you guys !

oh ,  i cant ,  honey .  im gonna go get my eyebrows shaped .   i am not happy .   oh .  .  .  sure you wanna eat that ?

seriously ?  
word !  
well ,  mine was worse than that .  
well ,  what happened ?  
we were at the game ,  and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing .  .  .  
oh ,  that is so tacky .  
well ,  thats what i said ,  but it turns out ,  mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night !  
oh my god ,  mike was gonna propose ?  
phoebe ,  thats huge !  
well ,  do you wanna marry him ?  
yeah ,  i really do !  yes ,  but ,  after i dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me ,  i dont think hes ever gonna ask again !  i mean ,  i said no in barbados and now this !  
she &apos;s right !  if i were a guy and .  .  .   did i just say if i were a guy .  .  ?  
maybe you don &apos;t need him to propose to you ,  maybe you can propose to him !  
oh ,  i don &apos;t know ,  i don &apos;t know ,  isn &apos;t that a little desperate ?  
i proposed to chandler !   alright ,  moving on .  .  .  
oh ,  i don &apos;t think it was desperate ,  i think it was amazing !  
thank you .  
 well ,  do you think i should propose ?  
i think it could be kind of great !

ok ,  ok ,  so how should i do it ?  
how about at a game ,  on the big screen ?  
 uuuh !  !  how about at a footlocker ?   
what ?  what ?  he obviously thinks that &apos;s a nice way to be proposed to ,  plus he &apos;d never suspect it !  
yeah ,  that does make sense .  ok ,  now ,  would .  .  .  would you two  like that ?  
sounds good to me .  .  .  but what would a guy think ?

just tell joey that you watched the tape and you liked it ,  but your bosses didn &apos;t .  then that way ,  you &apos;re the good guy and they &apos;re the bad guys .  
that &apos;s good !  i liked it ,  they didn &apos;t .   joey ,  for god &apos;s sake ,  go to work !   .

interview room .  ross and two other professors  are sitting on one side of a long desk .  benjamin hobart is sitting on the other side] 
the selection committee has chosen the three of you as our finalists today .  the ultimate decision will be based upon the answers you give to the questions i ask here .  i &apos;m gonna start with dr .  li .  dr .  li ,  you claim the field is too reliant on the linnaean taxonomic system .  how do you propose to correct this problem ?  osteological evidence .  i plan to begin there .  
 interesting .  
 i guess !  
dr .  biely ,  your proposal includes some field work .  where might that take place ?  south dakota .  
certainly .  very well .  and dr .  geller ,  when is my birthday ?  
 what ?  i .  .  .  i .  .  .   
care to venture a guess ?  
 may 12th ?  
 that &apos;s not even kinda close !   dr .  li ,  how many graduate students you &apos;d be needing ?  
i see ,  and dr .  biely ?  
certainly .  dr .  geller ,  which 1965 shirelles hit was later covered by a popular british invasion band ?  
 wha .  .  ?  i need 6 graduate students .  
no !  i &apos;m sorry ,  we were looking for  &quot; baby it &apos;s you &quot;  .  baby it &apos;s you .  
wha .  .  .  ?  wait ,  wait ,  wait ,  just a minute .  none of my questions have anything to do with paleontology .  
you &apos;re right ,  i apologize .  scratch the last question .  spell  &quot; boscodictiasaur &quot;  .  
 um .  .  .  i &apos;ve never heard of a  &quot; boscodictiasaur &quot;  .  
yeah ,  i just made it up .  spell it .  
 ok .   b  -  o  -  s  .  .  .  
no ,  it starts with a silent  &quot; m &quot;  .  
oh come on !  !  
joey and rachel &apos;s apartment .  chandler and rachel are talking . ] 
i can &apos;t believe joey .  i hate being called a liar !  
but you are a liar .  
what did i just say ?   
you still here ?  
yes ,  and i have to say ,  i am not just hurt .  i am insulted .  when i tell somebody i did something .  .  .  
ok whoah - hey .  .  .  let me just stop you right there ,  ok ?  first ,  you lied ,  right ?  then ,  you lied about lying ,  ok ?  then you lied about lying about lying ,  ok ?  so before you lie about lying about lying about lying about .  .  .  lying .  .  .   stop lying !  
why are you so sure i didn &apos;t watch this tape ?  
 you wanna know wh .  .  .  ?  you wanna know why ?   
well ,  this is going well .   
 here &apos;s how i know you didn &apos;t watch the tape ,  ok ?   if you had seen what was on this tape ,  believe me ,  you would have some comments .  alright ,  now remember ,  i got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in japan .   joey says  &quot; ichiban &quot;  .  it displays a few girls dancing around and joey fills most of the screen ,  he puts something blue on his lips and smacks them saying  &quot; lipstick for men !  &quot;  it goes on to show him playing a guitar and putting on more blue lipstick .  in the end he says seductively  &quot; ichiban .  .  .  lipstick for men &quot;  and  &quot; sahiko &quot;  and it ends .  chandler and rachel are speechless . ) 
 and that &apos;s how i know you didn &apos;t watch the tape !   .

i &apos;ve come here to apologize .  i think i may have let my feelings for charlie interfere with the interview process .  
 no !  stop !  
anyway ,  i &apos;ve decided to offer you the grant .  
 really ?  
well .  .  .  there is just one small .  .  .  stipulation .  .  .

i got it from monica .  she sold it to me for a very reasonable price .  
joey ,  we &apos;re not keeping this !  
but it &apos;s an original buffay .  .  .  
alright ,  fine .  you can keep it .  as long as you don &apos;t mind that she &apos;s haunted .  
hey ?  what ?  what ?  wey !  whoo !  what ?  what !  ?  
well ,  legend has it joey ,  that .  .  .  she comes alive when you &apos;re asleep .   
she climbs out of the frame ,  and then drags her half - a - body across the floor ,  just looking for legs to steal .   and then with her one good hand ,  she slo - o - owly re - e - a - aches up and turns your doorknob .  
get that legless witch out of here !

rachel and joey &apos;s .  joey &apos;s home alone ,  reading a sports illustrated magazine when chandler enters . ] 
look ,  i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t give them your tape .  and i promise ,  next time to submit you whether i think you are right for the part or not .  
that &apos;s not the point chandler .  the point is that you lied .  
i know .  you &apos;re right .  what &apos;s it gonna take for you to forgive me ?  
central perk .  monica ,  phoebe and rachel are on the couch . ]

central perk .  some time later that day .  the group has left and charlie is there when ross enters . ] 
your ex - boyfriend is insane .  
did you get the grant ?  
no i didn &apos;t ,  and you want to know why ?  because your ex - boyfriend is still in love with you .  
what ?  
yeah .  he wouldn &apos;t give me the grant ,  because i wouldn &apos;t give you up .  
benji isn &apos;t in love with me .  i mean ,  he broke up with me .  and besides ,  he &apos;s a very ethical man .  
really ?  is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review ,  who was the voice of  &quot; underdog &quot;  ?  
i &apos;m sure he was just joking ,  ross .  
if you don &apos;t believe me ,  let &apos;s go talk to him ,  okay ?  i &apos;m telling you ,  he didn &apos;t ask me one paleontological question .  
seriously ?  
oh ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  no .  he did ask me one .  uhm .  .  .  how do you spell mboscodictiosaur ?  
well ,  if it &apos;s like the lake mbosco in congo ,  then m - b - o .  .  .  
damnit !  
benjamin &apos;s office .  ross and charlie are entering . ] 
dr .  geller .  .  .  ?  charlie .  .  .  what are you .  .  .  what are you doing here ?  
i want you to tell her everything .  about the deal you tried to make with me ,  about the crazy questions you .  .  .  wally cox !  that &apos;s the voice of underdog !  
like i tried to tell you in the interview ross ,  this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia .  
no ,  no ,  no .  don &apos;t do that !  i want you to look her in the eyes ,  and tell her the truth .  
benji ?  
alright ,  it &apos;s true .  i behaved horribly .  but it &apos;s only because i still love you .  and i would do anything to have you back in my life .  
too little ,  too late ,  benji !  
i can &apos;t believe this .  
i never should have broken up with you .  i think about you all the time .  i mean ,  do you ever still think about me ?  
 no !  
yes !  
what ?  
i don &apos;t know what to say ,  benji .  this is all so .  .  .  .  romantic .  
or .  .  .  
listen ,  i know ,  i may be way out of bounds here ,  but is there any chance you will take me back ?  
maybe .  .  .  
sweetie ,  this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable .  
oh god !  i am so sorry ,  but .  .  .   i mean it &apos;s .  .  .  there &apos;s so much history between us ,  you know .  .  .  
 i &apos;m sorry too .  .  .   
i love you !  
i love you too !   
okay ,  that &apos;s it .  we are seeing other people !  commercial break

gladys ?   
ha ha ha ,  third time this week .  man ,  this does not get old .  
you &apos;re mean !  
oh ,  don &apos;t be such a baby !    
 
hey you guys !  
hey !  
hey ,  what are you doing ?  
oh ,  figuring out our wedding plans .  
that &apos;s funny ,  we were doing the same thing !  
yeah !  
it &apos;s really crazy !  the hall ,  the dress ,  the food .  .  .  i - i had no idea how expensive this stuff was !  
yeah it is really pricey .  i mean ,  i freaked when i first heard the numbers .  
so what did you two do about it ?  
it was pretty simple actually ,  i came up with a couple of cost - cutting solutions ,  wrote out a list and monica told me to go to hell .  
there &apos;s no way around it pheebs ,  you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money .  
i heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry .  
yeah ,  and i &apos;m responsible for just like half of that .  
but really ,  it does seem like this money could be put to better use ?  
are you serious ?  
yeah !  now ,  how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at city hall ?  
i think it would make me wanna marry you even more .   
i &apos;ve got to say you guys ,  that &apos;s an incredible gesture !  
 maybe you do that next time you get married !  
no ,  no ,  no .  the next time it &apos;s gonna be a hawaii at sunset .   but maybe the time after that !  opening credits 
 
hey !  
hey !  
what &apos;s going on ?  
our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment .  
 we ?  
you know you don &apos;t want me to help .  you can &apos;t have it both ways !  
hey ,  is this person who decides whether or not you .  .  .  get a baby ?  
kind of .  she &apos;s coming by to interview us and see where we live .  
and it has to go perfectly ,  because if she doesn &apos;t like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state .  
hey ,  maybe i should stop by !  she could be a soap opera fan !  it &apos;s very impressive when the little people know a celebrity .  
 little people ?  
 celebrity .  
ok ,  so i think i &apos;m just about done here ,  unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere ,  like .  .  .  porn or cigarettes ?  
what .  .  .  ?  no !  
chandler ?  
 i don &apos;t ,  and i &apos;m offended by the insinuation !  
ok ,  so there &apos;s not a magazine under the couch ,  or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank ,  or a filthy video in the vcr ?  
i &apos;ll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine ,  but that tape is not mine .  
it isn &apos;t mine !  
yes .  we &apos;re here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children .  is always appreciated .

so ,  uhm .  .  .  what are you gonna do today ?

yes ,  i was 4 years old and i was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain .  and to get me out my mom had to - had to cut a big chunk of my hair !   and it was uneven for weeks !  
 and you made it through that ?  i wonder who &apos;s gonna play you in the movie !  
ok ,  fine !  you can make fun of me .  i do not want emma going there .  and i was thinking claire danes .  
look ,  i &apos;m sorry to hear about your tragedy ,  ok ?  but the swings are perfectly safe ,  and besides emma loves them .  you know what ,  you should come with us and you &apos;ll see !  
ross ,  those things go like 40 miles an hour !  ok ?  when you &apos;re .  .  .  and there is that moment when you are at the top ,  when you just don &apos;t know if you &apos;re gonna return back to earth !  
space is filled with orbiting children .   look ,  please ,  just come on ,  you know ,  when youll see the look on emmas face ,  i swear you wont regret it .  
all right !  
good ,  you dont want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children ,  do you ?  
irrational ,  huh ?  all right ,  well ,  ill remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment !

monica and chandler &apos;s .  they are preparing to show laura around .  laura is standing with her back to the window ,  chandler and monica are standing on either side of her ,  facing each other .  
well ,  i must say ,  this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child in .  
oh ,  by the way ,  you are more than welcome to look under any of the furniture ,  because ,  believe me ,  you won &apos;t find any porn or cigarettes under there !  
oh !  well ,  actually ,  before we look around ,  let me make sure i have everything i need up to here .  .  .   
 why don &apos;t i show you the baby &apos;s room ?

hey !  
are you kidding ?  
well ,  it &apos;s just with uhm ,  work and the stress of adoption ,  we just don &apos;t feel like we have the energy .  plus ,  we don &apos;t think it &apos;s fair that every year the burden falls on us .  
 that doesn &apos;t sound like you .  .  .  that &apos;s monica talking !  
no ,  no !  we made this decision together .  
she &apos;s putting words in your mouth !  
don &apos;t you put words in people &apos;s mouths ,  you put turkey in people &apos;s mouths !

well ,  i wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant .  
oh my god !  that &apos;s the creepiest thing i &apos;ve ever heard !  
okay ,  but ,  well ,  before you say no ,  my friend susanne is entering her kid and compared to emma she &apos;s a real dog !  
oh !  phoebe ,  all babies are beautiful !  
 oh .  .  .  okay .  
phoebe ,  just the idea of pitting one baby against another ,  i mean ,  you know ,  and judging who &apos;s cuter just for a trophy .  .  .  
and a thousand dollars .  
 .  .  . is something i &apos;m very interested in !  oh please ,  do not tell ross .  he still believes that  what &apos;s in the inside is important .  .  .  
okay ,  oh ,  and emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition .  
where am i gonna get a cowgirl outfit on thanksgiving ?  
well ,  i was thinking .  .  .  
oh ,  take the clothes of joey &apos;s cabbage patch kid .  
 did someone drop the baton again ?  
why come all the way from kansas to do that ?  
 i don &apos;t get older .  i just get better !  
you know what just occurred to me ?  this could be our last thanksgiving just the two of us .  i mean ,  we could be getting a baby soon !  
you don &apos;t know that .  
somebody is gonna pick us .  
yeah ,  but we haven &apos;t heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks !  
i &apos;m telling ya !  it &apos;s gonna happen .  next year it &apos;s gonna be you ,  me and the little hemingway bing .   what ,  he &apos;s my favourite author !  
name one of his books .  
  &quot; the firm &quot;  ?  
ok ,  let &apos;s see .  .  .  uhm ,  okay ,  the turkey is in the oven ,  the stuffing is ready .  .  .  
you know ,  you always cook this meal all by yourself .  let me help this year .  
oh ,  chandler ,  that &apos;s sweet .  but you don &apos;t have to do everything doctor phil tells you to do .  
i &apos;m serious ,  let me do something ,  just not the turkey or the stuffing ,  nothing  &quot; high profile &quot;  .  
ok ,  let &apos;s see .  .  .  oh ,  the cranberry sauce ,  it is easy to make and no - one really cares about it .  
tell me more .  
okay ,  i &apos;m gonna go check on something across the hall .  you start by washing these  not with soap !  !   
you obviously haven &apos;t tasted my palmolive potatoes !   
hey !  hey ,  guess what joey has !  
three tickets to today &apos;s rangers game !  !  
dude ,  i wanted him to guess .  
oh .

center ice .  
did i do something to you ?  
hmm ,  the game &apos;s at one .  
so ?  
dinner is at four ,  we &apos;ll never gonna make it back .  
so we &apos;ll leave before it &apos;s over ,  we &apos;ll be back in time .  
you say that now ,  but it could take us a long time to get back home .  plus joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up .  
dude ,  two times that happened !  
look ,  monica has been working hard all day ,  she didn &apos;t wanna host this thing in the first place ,  we shouldn &apos;t go !  
he &apos;s right ,  man .  
right ,  i guess .  alright ,  so see you at four .  
okay .   and get ready to taste my very special cranberries .  or should i say .  .  .  chanberries !  
that &apos;s some gentle comedy ,  dude .   
we &apos;re still going at the game ,  right ?  
yeah !  
this is contestant number sixteen ,  rebecca .  .  .  
hey .  
oh phoebe ,  listen .  well ,  i think we gotta go .  this place is really freaking me out .  i &apos;ve been watching this guy over there ,  i don &apos;t think he came with a kid !  
we can &apos;t leave now !  there was this one baby ,  haley ,  who was favourite to win and she got croup ,  so she had to stay home !  this competition just blew wide open ,  folks !  
phoebe ,  i think .  .  .  it &apos;s just too weird ,  i just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on !  
oh ,  i know ,  we should have been more prepared .   it &apos;s okay .  now ,  the way i see it ,  our real competition now is cameron .  oh my god ,  they just took her sweater off .  look at those arms !  hello michelin man .  
oh ,  phoebe !  come on !  you know what ,  it &apos;s already three o &apos;clock and they haven &apos;t even gotten to emma &apos;s group yet .  we gotta go ,  we got dinner !  
 but emma &apos;s got what it takes ,  she could go all the way !  
phoebe ,  you have to calm down .  
okay .  rachel ,  the hottest babies in the tri - state area are in this room right now !  i overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to emma !  
really ?  
yeah !  
you heard them say that ?  
yeah !  
all right ,  okay .  alright ,  let &apos;s give to these babies something to cry about !  
good !  oh yay !  let &apos;s get down to business !  emma needs some makeup !  
no ,  what ?  
well ,  she &apos;s gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants !

yeah .  i am sorry he &apos;s not here too ,  but i got to say ,   i am really enjoying nacho chair .

ohhhh !  these seats are great !  
i know ,  i know !  when i was here for holidays on ice  i was sitting so far away michelle kwan couldn &apos;t read my banner !  
 wow ,  hey ,  we &apos;d better get going .  if we don &apos;t leave right now ,  we &apos;ll be late for dinner .

that was the adoption agency .  .  .  
and ?  
we &apos;re getting a baby !  
are you serious ?   
there &apos;s a pregnant woman in ohio ,  and she picked us !   
i &apos;m so happy for you !  
to monica and chandler .  .  .  and that knocked up girl in ohio .  
i &apos;m just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid .  
i know .  have you considered pageanting ?  
i can &apos;t believe they called ,  and we &apos;re actually getting a baby .   
oh ,  i know how you feel .  .  .   
really ?  
sure .  i went through the exact same thing with alicia mae emory .  .  .  the waiting ,  the wandering .  .  .  then one day .  .  .  i get that call from toys  &quot; r &quot;  us .  .  .  she was in stock !  
hi !  
hey !  
hey !  
we &apos;re just here to say goodbye ,  we &apos;re off to ohio .  
oh ,  right !  your adoption interview !  
yep ,  we &apos;re gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby .  
i can &apos;t believe it .  when you guys come back ,  you &apos;re gonna have a baby !  that is so weird !  
and so incorrect !  
she &apos;s only a couple of months pregnant .  she liked our application but who knows if she &apos;s gonna like us .  
come on ,  she &apos;s gonna love you guys !  
uhm ,  thank you ,  but we &apos;re really trying not to get our hopes up .  
and a lot could still get in our way .  
yeah .  i mean ,  this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better .  .  
what are you gonna name the baby ?  
i can develop a condition in which i talk and talk and no one hears a word .  
but just think ,  ok ?  what if everything goes right ?  what if this woman does pick you guys ?  
oh my god .  she &apos;s gonna pick us !  
so we &apos;re standing firm on the  &apos;not getting our hopes up &apos; ?  
you know ,  i know that things could still go wrong but if they don &apos;t ?  if this works out ,  we &apos;re gonna have a baby chandler ,  a baby !  
yes ,  but .  .  .  
oh my god ,  it &apos;s gonna work !  we &apos;re gonna make it work !  i &apos;m gonna be a mummy and  you &apos;re gonna be a daddy !  all right ,  i &apos;ll see you suckers .  i &apos;m gonna get me .  .  .  a baby !

that &apos;s what our friends call us .  
gosh ,  you know ,  you &apos;re just such an amazing couple .  it &apos;s .  .  .  kind of intimidating .  
i don &apos;t know about that .  
you &apos;re kidding me ?  i mean ,  it &apos;s enough that you are a doctor .  but on top of it ,  you &apos;re married to a reverend ?  
 i don &apos;t think that &apos;s exactly .  .  .  
hey !  
hey .  
oh ,  my friend sarah had a great time last night .  
well .  .  .  
yeah !  so you &apos;re gonna call this one back ?

oh ,  really ?  you know what your great friend did ?  we &apos;re out to dinner ,  ok ?   we &apos;re getting along ,  having a really nice time .  i was thinking she was really cool .  and then ,  out of nowhere .  .  .   
thats it ?  thats why you wont go out with her again ?  so ,  she took some fries ,  big deal !  
hey ,  hey ,  look !  its not about a few fries .  .  .  its about what the fries represent .  
what ?  
all food !  
im sorry ,  i cant believe i set you up with such a monster !  
hey ,  hey ,  hey ,  hey .  look .  i take a girl out ,  she can order whatever she wants !  the more ,  the better !  all right ?  just dont order a garden salad and then eat my food !  thats a good way to lose some fingers !   
 oh 
hi 
thank god youre here .  listen to this !  
what ?  
joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries .  .  .  
oh !  oh ,  no !   
what ?  you know about the plate thing ?  
oh ,  yeah .  joey doesnt share food .  i mean ,  just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and  .  .  .  
 you wouldnt let her have a grape ?  
oh no !  not me !  emma !   
 joey doesnt share food !  
well ,  i still think that its a stupid reason not to call someone again .  you are calling her !  and if you need to ,  just get an extra plate of fries for the table !  
 this place is awesome !  
you know ,  we should just go ,  im not gonna find anything here !  this stuff is ridiculous !   
ah ,  this place is great !  
wow !  
rach ,  come on ,  im not gonna wear any of this !   nothing silver .   .  ok ?  nothing with hair !   and nothing with padlocks on it !   .  
ross ,  look ,  i know that some of this stuff is out there ,  but i mean ,  come on ,  look at this ,  look at this sweater !   .  i mean ,  this is just beautiful !  
 wow ,  this is really soft  .  three hundred and fifty dollars ?  
yeah ,  down from seven hundred ,  you are saving like two hundred bucks !  
both logic and math are taking a serious hit today .  
 hey ,  check this out !  its totally you !  
wow !  
yeah !   
actually this looks like pretty good !  yeah !  boys will be boys ?  
what ?  they will be !  
all right ,  thats it ,  im getting out of here .  
no ,  no ,  no ,  no !  ross ,  wait !  come on !  you know ,  theres other stuff .  heres a nice shirt ,  look at these nice pants .  .  .  
uh ,  actually these might look pretty good on me .  
yes ,  they will !  you know what you should do ?  just go take a walk ,  all right ?  i know your size and im .  .  .  im gonna pick up some really good stuff for you .  
really ?  
yes !  and i know what looks sexy on guys .  please ,  just wear what i suggest ,  and shes gonna go nuts for you .  
so ,  youre saying ,  uh ,  if i wear these pants i might be getting into hers ?  
so ,  the fact that i am a doctor ,  and my wifes a reverend ,  thats important to you ?  
yeah ,  i read some great applications ,  but then i thought who better then a minister to raise a child !  
amen .  
plus i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor !  
uh ,  good hands .   healing hands .  
reverend ,  can i ask ?  does the bible say anything about adoption ?  
it says  &quot; do it !  &quot;  and behold she did adopt unto them a baby .  and it was good .  
wow .  
yeah ,  wow .  
i was wondering you both have such serious jobs .   would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock ?  
oh ,  you know ,  my flock is good ,  i mean ,  yeah ,  my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point .  good flock .  flock ,  flock ,  flock .  
 being a doctor must take up a lot of time .  
not for me it doesnt .   
were great ,  i think i may have asked all my questions .  
yeah ,  actually .  so ,  you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us ?  were very proud of it .  
you should be .  youre really on top of stuff .  .  nothing else ,  then the two of us should talk .  
actually ,  i dont think we have to .  
we dont ?  
yeah ,  when i read about you two ,  i was pretty sure i wanted you ,  but i just thought we should meet face to face .   .  i &apos;ve made my decision .  i choose them .  
oh my god ,  this is great !  this is so great !   .  did you hear that ?  
yeah ,  i did .  
we got some really great stuff !  
yeah ,  yeah but i am not sure about some of the bra &apos;s i got .  
oh !  really ?  do you wanna try some of them on for me ?  
oh !  okay .  wait ,  are we in joey &apos;s imagination ?  
 oh no !  i took one of ross &apos; bags by mistake ,  and one of mine is missing .  
 so ?  what do you think ?   
i think were not wearing the same shirt anymore !  !  
 yeah !  yeah !  rachel picked it out for me .  she told me to trust her and you know what ?  i &apos;m glad i did !  i turned quite a few heads on my way over here .  
 dude ,  i really don &apos;t think you should be wearing that .  
oh ,  i see ,  somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies ?  
 looks like someone is the ladies !  !  
we are not signing those papers .  
why not ?  
it &apos;s wrong .  they made a mistake .  they think we &apos;re somebody else .  
god works in mysterious ways .  
you have gotta stop !  
but she liked us .  
she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica .  
well ,  if you think about it ,  i am kind of like a reverend .  i mean ,  as a chef ,  i serve god ,  by feeing the hungry and poor .   
your veal chop is $34 . 95 !  
c &apos;mon chandler ,  i think we have been given an opportunity .  i mean ,  the mistake has already been made .  they are writing up the paper right now .  
but we are not the one she chose !  how can you feel okay about this ?  
 because .  .  .  we may not be who she thinks we are but no - one will ever love that baby more than us .  
i know .  .  
i mean ,  who knows how long it &apos;s gonna take for someone else to give us a baby ?  what if ,  what if no one ever picks us ?  
oh ,  honey .  .  
 please .  .  please ,  we are so close .  
monica ,  i want a baby too ,  but this woman is giving away her child .  she deserves to know who it &apos;s going to .  
 okay ,  right .   
so ,  we &apos;ll tell the truth and who knows ,  maybe she &apos;ll like us for us .  
 maybe she will .  uh !  why couldn &apos;t i have been a reverend ?  
you &apos;re jewish .  
a garden salad for the lady  
oh ,  that looks great !  good ordering !  
seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries .  enjoy !  
mmmh ,  those fries look delicious .  
oh ,  i didn &apos;t know you liked french fries .  help yourself !  what &apos;s mine is yours .   
 oh wow ,  are those stuffed clams ?  
uuuh .  .  yes ,  they are my stuffed clams .   
how about those fries though ,  huh ?   
they are delicious  
 you are beautiful ,  you know that ?  
oh ,  that is so sweet .  .  
oh  okay .  .    
 now look what you did !  !  
what ?  what is the matter with you ?  
i don &apos;t like it when people take food off of my plate ,  okay ?  
but you just said  &quot; what &apos;s mine is yours &quot;  ?  
well ,  i didn &apos;t mean it !  
fine ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  i didn &apos;t think it was that big a deal .  
wow ,  this place looks great .  
oh !  you are gonna love it !   and i &apos;m so glad ,  we &apos;re finally doing this .  
me too !   
i really am sorry about ,  you know .  . before .  i just want to make sure you know that i really do like you .  
sure  just not as much as clams .  
 well ,  stuffed clams .   
chocolate torte for the lady ,  cheesecake for the gentleman .  
uh ,  excuse me sir ,  there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake .  
yes ,  that &apos;s raspberry coule .  
 so stupid ,  ordering cheesecake ,  trying to be healthy .   
 oh my god !   
oh ,  all right ,  i &apos;ll just have what she &apos;s having instead .  
oh ,  i &apos;m sorry sir ,  that was our last piece .  
mmmm !  mmm !   
oh ,  no !  this is work .  i should call in .  can you excuse me ?  
oh yeah ,  sure .  no problem .   
what are you doing ?  i thought you don &apos;t share food .  
sure i do .   coule ?  
 no .  if i can &apos;t have your clams ,  you can &apos;t have my dessert .  this is a two way street .  
 really ?  
really !  now this all better be here when i come back .   
yeah ,  of course .  i can control myself .    
 stop staring at me !   
why ,  just a tiny little .  .  .   
oh - oh !  time lapse  
hi !  
hey .  an open adoption .  there &apos;s a lot to go over ,  but i &apos;ll explain everything as we go through it .  
 i - is .  .  .  is that a picture ?  
yeah .  it &apos;s a sonogram they took of the baby last week .  i thought you might want to see it .   
look ,  doctor !   look ,  before we sign anything we really have to talk .  .  .  we &apos;re not who you think we are .  
the agency must have made some mistake .  my wife is not a reverend and i &apos;m not a doctor .  
what ?  
i could perform an operation on you and prove it if you &apos;d like .  
so who are you ?  
well ,  our names really are monica and chandler .  we &apos;re from new york .  
yeah ,  but the important thing to know about us ,  is how much we would care for this little baby .   
so you lied to me before ?  
well ,  we .  .  .    &quot; bore false witness &quot;  .  .  .  see i could be a reverend .  
i can &apos;t believe this .  
but we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider .  .  .  
giving you my baby ?  you think i &apos;d give you my child after this ?  
well ,  you don &apos;t have to decide right now ,  but if you could just look at our file .  .  .  
i don &apos;t want to look at your file !  this is over .   
erica wait !  
i &apos;ve nothing to say to you .   
you have every reason to be upset .  we did lie .  but only because we &apos;ve been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long .  now we don &apos;t know how long it &apos;s gonna be before we can get another chance again .  
why don &apos;t you ask the reverend to pray on it ?  
erica ,  please .  just consider us .  ask them to see our file .  our last name &apos;s bing .  my wife &apos;s a chef and i &apos;m in advertising .  
oh yeah .  i actually liked you guys .  but it doesn &apos;t matter ,  because what you did was wrong .   
but you did like us .  and you should .  my wife &apos;s an incredible woman .  she &apos;s loving and devoted and caring .  and don &apos;t tell her i said this but the woman &apos;s always right .  .  .  i love my wife more than anything in this world .  and i .  .  .  it kills me that i can &apos;t give her a baby .  .  .  i really want a kid .  and when that day finally comes ,  i &apos;ll learn how to be a good dad .  but my wife .  .  .  she &apos;s already there .  she &apos;s a mother .  .  .  without a baby .  .  .  please ?   
you still want that baby ?   
turns out this sweater is made for a woman .  
 so ,  why are you still wearing it ?  
because it &apos;s soft .  .  .  hey ,  so how was your date ?  
ooh .  .  .  not so good .

oh ,  i &apos;m sorry honey ,  you know ,  but when she said  &quot; sex &quot;  i wasn &apos;t thinking about  &quot; sex with you &quot;  !

ross ,  how about you .  what would you give up ,  sex or food ?  
food .

you know ,  i &apos;m always right about these things .  
no ,  you &apos;re not !  last week you thought ross was trying to kill you !  
well ,  i &apos;m sorry but it &apos;s hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it !   see ,  there &apos;s something going on with them .  look ,  he &apos;s getting into the car with her !  
oh ,  that doesn &apos;t mean anything .

i was in the car with nancy all day .  
nancy doesnt smoke !  
well ,  at least the perfume is not mine ,  be thankful for that !  
so ?  what do you think of the house ?  
its perfect .  its everything weve been looking for .  
isnt it ?  then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic ?  
and the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps ?   what were the things you said ?  
dont you love the huge yard ?  
and the fireplace in the bedroom .  
and nancy said that it &apos;s really under price ,  because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents !  
this is bringing out a lovely color in you !  
so ?  do you think we should get it ?  
i dont know .  what do you think ?  
i think we should .  
i do too .  
this is huge !  
i know .  
how bad you wanna smoke ,  right now .  
i dont know what you mean ,  giant talking cigarette !  oh ,  by the way ,  phoebe called just as i was getting into nancys car ,  so if she asks you ,  i was at work all day .  
gotcha .  when do we tell them about this ?  
we dont .  not until it &apos;s a hundred percent .  i mean ,  why upset everybody over nothing .  
okay .  right .  oh my god that is gonna be so hard .  
i just cant see chandler cheating !  
im telling you guys ,  we followed them out to a house in westchester ,  the went in for like forty - five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy !  
chandler ?  forty - five minutes ?  well ,  something is not right .  i just cant believe he would do this to monica !  
i know ,  and with the baby coming ?  
so ,  should we tell her ?  
i dont know .  phoebe ,  if one of us saw mike with another woman would you want us to tell you ?  
why ?  whod you seen him with ?  
no one ,  im just saying if .  .  .   
tell me what you know !  
 i know nothing !  mikes a great guy ,  it was hypothetical !  
all right .   .  he is a good guy .  youre right ,  he wouldnt cheat .  
oh ,  look at her ,  so happy !  
if only there were a smaller one to clean this one !  
hey ,  is uhm .  .  .  is chandler here ?  
no ,  hes picking up dinner ,  why ,  whats up ?  
well ,  look ,  whatever happens ,  were here for you and we love you .  
we think chandler might be having an affair .  
what ?  
phoebe and i saw chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in westchester .  
they went in together .  so sorry .  
oh my god !  oh my god thats awful !  what did you think of the house ?   
what ?  
 monica ,  you understand what we are saying ,  right ?  
yeah ,  sure .  .  .  uhm ,  i &apos;m devastated ,  obviously .  .  .   did you think the neighborhood was homey ?   
hey !  
 you son of a bitch !  
is it me ,  or have the greetings gone downhill around here ?  
 phoebe and rachel saw you with nancy today and .  .  .  em .  .  .  they think you &apos;re having an affair .  
who &apos;s nancy ?  
what &apos;s going on ?  
 ok ,  alright ,  you guys ,  you &apos;d better sit down ,  this is pretty big .  
yeah  i &apos;m not having an affair .  nancy is our realtor .  
i knew he couldn &apos;t be with a woman for 45 minutes !  !  
why do you have a realtor ?  
uhm ,  she has been showing us houses outside of the city .  
 what ?  
are you serious ?  
when we found out that we &apos;re gonna get this baby ,  chandler and i started talking and we decided that we didn &apos;t want to raise a kid in the city .  
so you &apos;re gonna move ?  
oh my god .  
shouldn &apos;t we all vote on stuff like this ?  !  
what is wrong with raising a kid in the city ?  i &apos;m doing it ,  ross is doing it ,  sarah jessica parker is doing it !  
and that &apos;s great for you guys ,  but we want a lawn and a swingset .  .  .  
 .  .  . and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice - cream truck can go by .  
 so you wanna buy a house in the 50 &apos;s ?  
have you thought about what you would be giving up ?  you can &apos;t move out of the city ,  what if you want chinese food at 5am ?  or a fake rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an asian hooker sent right to your door ?  
you know what ,  if you wanna look for a house ,  that &apos;s okay .  
no ,  no ,  it &apos;s not ,  don &apos;t listen to him !   i &apos;m gonna thump you !   
 it &apos;s ok ,  because they have to get it out of their system ,  okay  ,  but you &apos;re going to realize ,  this is the only place ,  you wanna be .   
actually ,  we already found a house we love .  
what ?  
and about an hour ago ,  we made an offer .   
bet you wish i was having an affair now ,  huh ?  time lapse 
you put an offer on a house ?  
 it &apos;s so sweet .  it really is .  it has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there &apos;s these old maple trees .  .  .   
wha .  .  ?  again with the nature ,  what are you ?  beavers ?  
i know this is really hard and we &apos;re really sorry .  
is this because i come over here without knocking and eat your food ?   because i can stop doing that ,   i really ,  really think i can !  
 you know that &apos;s not the reason joe .   
we think if you saw it ,  you &apos;d understand .  i mean you guys were there .   it is beautiful ,  isn &apos;t it ?  
yeah it is .  
what the hell are you doin &apos; ?  
well ,  it is ,  all right ?  when we were out there is screwing this woman ,  but man this would be a nice place to live !  
yeah ,  but so is this .  
yeah ,  i mean ,  if you moved there ,  you have to leave here .  i mean ,  how can you leave this place ?    
 c &apos;mon daddy ,  listen to me !  all of my life ,  everyone has always told me ,   &apos;you &apos;re a shoe !  you &apos;re a shoe ,  you &apos;re a shoe ,  you &apos;re a shoe !  &apos; .  and today i just stopped and i said ,   &apos;what if i don &apos;t wanna be a shoe ?  what if i wanna be a -  a purse ,  y &apos;know ?  or a -  or a hat !  no ,  i don &apos;t want you to buy me a hat ,  i &apos;m saying that i am a ha -  it &apos;s a metaphor ,  daddy !  
you can see where he &apos;d have trouble .

nineteen eighty seven .  the weekend you guys visited me at school .  
oh my god !  that &apos;s wild !  
yeah ,  but it was like a million years ago ,  so it doesn &apos;t matter .  
well ,  it matters to me .  
why ?  
because .  .  .  the night you kissed rachel was the night i kissed rachel for the very first time .  
you kissed her that night too ?  
two guys in one night ?  wow ,  i thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed .  
seriously ,  where did this happen ?  
okay ,  after you told me she was passed out in our room ,  i went in there to make sure she was all right .  she was lying on my bed ,  all buried in peoples &apos; coats .  well ,  i went to kiss her on the forehead ,  you know .  but it was so dark ,  i accidentally got her lips .  i started to pull away ,  but then i felt her start to kiss me back .  it was only for a second ,  but .  .  .  it was amazing .  and now ,  now i find out that you kissed her first .  
oh wait .  .  .  what bed did you say she was on ?  
mine .  
i &apos;m pretty sure i put her on my bed .  
no ,  she was definitely on my bed .  
why would i kiss a girl ,  and then put her on your bed ?  
well ,  then who was on my bed ?  
 oh !  oh ,  oh !   
 no !  no ,  no !  
yes !   
you were under the pile of coats ?  
i was the pile of coats !

so he can &apos;t come ?  
no ,  and so there &apos;s no one to walk me down the aisle and .  .  .  well ,  i would just really love it if you would do it .

what harpist ?  my friend marjorie is playing the steel drums .  
ooh .  .  .  she backed out .  
she did ?  why ?

 you know what i just realized ?  we have no idea what we &apos;re doing in the wedding tomorrow .

oh ,  hey ,  my pleasure .   so what are your intentions with my phoebe ?  
i intend to marry her .

you &apos;re right .  she probably will support me .  hey ,  unless we move in with you ,  dad ?  
strike three !  you only get one more ,  mike !   
so ,  what did you decide ?  
i decided to pee .  
mike didn &apos;t tell you ?  you have to choose one of us to be in your wedding .  one of his groomsmen fell out .  
oh no ,  no .  i can &apos;t choose between you two !  i love you both so much !  
just not enough to put us in the original wedding party .  
oh ,  i don &apos;t wanna choose !  it &apos;s  .  oh okay ,  wait .  rach !  listen i have a very special bridesmaid task for you today .  
 goody ,  what is it !  
well ,  there &apos;s a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between ross and chandler .  so good luck with that .  
what ,  what ,  what ,  no ,  i don &apos;t wanna do that .  
all right ,  i guess i &apos;ll have to find a new bridesmaid .  
i &apos;ll do it !   
ok ,  it &apos;s 2100 hours .   time for your toast .   
do i have a minute to go to the bathroom ?  
you had a bathroom break at 2030 .  pee on your own time ,  mike !   .  now ,  in regard to the toast ,  okay ,  you wanna keep them short ,  nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches .  okay .  you just get in ,  do your thing and get out !  
is that what you say to chandler ?  
 it &apos;s 2101 and i am not amused .   .  ok ,  the bride and groom have a few words they &apos;d like to say .   
ok .  hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight .  so tomorrow &apos;s the big event and some of you might not know ,  but mike and i didn &apos;t get off to the best start .   .  my friend joey and i decided to fix each other up with friends so i ,  i .  .  .   oh i .  .  .  hum .  .  .  i gave it a lot of thought and i fixed him up with my friend mary ellen who couldn &apos;t be here tonight because .  .  .   it &apos;s not important .  .  .  she is in rehab .  anyway ,  so ,  ok ,  joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend mike ,  only he didn &apos;t have a friend mike so he just brought ,  uhm ,  my mike and ,  and  but despite ,  you know .  .  .  it got .  .  .  it got good .  ok ,  i wanna take a moment to mention my mother ,  who couldn &apos;t be here .  .  .  
and .  .  .  moment &apos;s over !   so ,  ok ,  uh ,  i can forget that .  i can forget that and uhm .  .  .   oh this is funny !  oh ,  but you need to know that to .  .  .  that ,  to .  .  .  oh ,  ok ,  well ,  uhm ,  i  .  ok ,  ok ,  i ,  ok ,  i .  .  .  .  monica i can &apos;t do it like this !  this is my wedding !  okay ,  i don &apos;t want this  or this  or this  ok ?  i just wanted a simple wedding !  where my fiancee can go to the bathroom anytime he wants !   you know what ?  you &apos;re done .

 joe ,  i love phoebe .  she &apos;s the single most important thing in my life .  i &apos;d die before i let anything happen to her .  
 that &apos;s what i wanted to hear !  because she &apos;s family ,  ok ,  and now you &apos;re gonna be family ,  and there is nothing more important in the whole world ,  than family .  
that must have been one lousy movie .  
hi 
hey ,  can i talk to you about this groomsman thing ?  if you pick ross ,  he &apos;ll walk you down the isle just fine .  but if you choose me ,  you &apos;ll be getting some comedy !  
even so ,  i think i &apos;m gonna pick ross .  
let me tell you why you need to pick me .   see ,  when i was a kid ,  i was always left out of everything ,  you know ,  and it really made me feel .  .  .  insecure .  you know ,  i was always picked last in gym .  even behind that big fat exchange student who didn &apos;t even know the rules to baseball .  i mean ,  this guy would strike out and then run to third .  anyway ,  if i &apos;m the only one left out of this wedding ,  i just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back .  
all right fine ,  i pick you .  
 y - y - yeeesss !  make  &quot; groom &quot;  for chandler .  
no !  we &apos;re gonna do it my way .   because your way is stupid !  alright i gotta go ,  i have another call ,  reverend .   hello ?   
i &apos;m glad we had this little talk .  
yes .  yeah and thanks for all the wedding night advice .   that didn &apos;t make me uncomfortable at all !  alright ,  so i &apos;ll see everybody tonight ?  
okay .  
bye .   
uhm ,  did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall ?  
oh my god ,  what &apos;s it doing here ?  
 ugh ,  i guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address .   uh !  what a pickle .  
 oh my god ,  everything is such a mess .  why is this happening to me ?  
how &apos;s it going ?  
 good .  i &apos;m just getting some coffee .  so i &apos;m alert for the wedding .  
 that &apos;s what i was doing too .  
 well ,  you have fun tonight .  
you too .  
oh ,  i will .  
me too .   
wait a minute ,  i know why i &apos;m being such an ass ,  why are you ?  
i &apos;m not supposed to tell you .  
i &apos;m not supposed to tell you !   
you told us both we could be in the wedding ?   
well ,  in my defense ,  you were not supposed to tell each other .  
rachel ,  only one of us can do it ,  you have to choose .  you and me together again .   
rach ,  rach ,  knock knock .  
who &apos;s there ?  
i &apos;ll tell you at the wedding .  
uh .   
hey ,  i forgot my scarf .  
you know what ,  i can &apos;t do this .  i don &apos;t know which one of you guys to pick .  
oh ,  you haven &apos;t picked yet .  oh good ,   &apos;cause i had an idea .  i thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog .  chappy .  
what ?  a dog ?  no !  rachel gets to choose .   
 wow ,  this is a tough one .  i think i &apos;m gonna have to go with the dog .    
alright ,  wait ,  so what you &apos;re saying is that the chef is at the hamilton club ,  but the food is not and the drinks are there ,  but the bartender is not ?  are you ,  are you freaking kidding me !  ?  
 how &apos;s it going ?  
 help me .  
what ?

hey ,  what are you guys gonna do ?

the blizzard .  i just saw on the news ,  it &apos;s like the worst snow storm in 20 years !  they already closed all the bridges and tunnels .   
ooh !  but the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from new jersey !  
i don &apos;t think they are .  
 well ,  the club lost it &apos;s power .  
yeah according to the news ,  most of the city did .  
since when do you watch the news ?  
uh ,  for your information ,  since they hired a very hot weather girl .  
 i can &apos;t believe you guys aren &apos;t going to be able to get married today .  
i know .  
wow ,  you know ,  it &apos;s so beautiful out there .  you always wanted to get married outside .  why don &apos;t you guys just do it on the street ?  
what ?  
well ,  look ,  it &apos;s hardly snowing anymore .  i mean you couldn &apos;t ask for a more romantic setting .  this could be the simple wedding you &apos;ve always wanted !  
 what do you think ?  
i think i wanna get married to you today .  
me too !   monica ,  do you think we could do it ?  
 ok let &apos;s get these chairs out here !  gunther ,  hit the christmas lights .   okay ,  who left the ice sculpture  on the steam grate ?   
hey !  you made it .  great !  chappy !  hi !   hi !   mom ,  i know getting married in the street isn &apos;t something you approve of .  .  .  i could look at them forever .  and put it in her drink .  .  .   come on ,  sweetheart .  
 you know ,  chappy &apos;s too small to handle all this snow .  someone &apos;s gonna have to walk him down the aisle .  
so technically ,  would this person be in the wedding ?  
i guess .  
no ,  but chandler ,  hello .  .  .  aren &apos;t you scared of dogs ?  
i &apos;m not scared .   i &apos;ll just take little chappy and .  .  .   he can sense my fear .  my throat is exposed .  
 well ,  i guess i &apos;m in the wedding then .  ha haaa .  .  .   he stinks !  
level 1 alert .  i repeat ,  level 1 .  this is not a drill .  okay we &apos;ve got a situation .  the minister just called .  he &apos;s snowed in .  he can &apos;t make it .  
oh ,  no !  
oh hey ,  don &apos;t worry .  i &apos;m still ordained from your wedding .  
really ?  
yeah ,  you &apos;d think i &apos;d give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway ?  uhh - uh .  .  .  
uhm ,  ministers don &apos;t ride the subway for free .  
i had to read the bible pretty carefully ,  but .  .  .  yeah we do .

oh ,  uhm ,  okay ,  uhm ,  do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father ?  
oh ,  sure .  yeah ,  well ,  he was my high school boyfriend .  captain of the football team ,  really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college .   
that &apos;s great .  
yeah .  .  .  it &apos;s almost definitely him .   
how &apos;s that now ?  
well ,  there is a chance it &apos;s another guy .  i mean ,  i have only ever been with two guys ,  but they sorta overlapped .  
so ,  what does the other guy do ?  does he go to college too ?  
no ,  he &apos;s in prison .   
was he falsely accused of something ?   
no .  .  .  he killed his father with a shovel .   but other than that ,  he &apos;s a great guy .  
i &apos;ll bet his dad doesn &apos;t think so .   
are you awake ?  
of course i &apos;m awake .  assume from now on that i &apos;m always awake !   
alright ,  we don &apos;t know that it &apos;s him .  i mean ,  it could be the football guy .  
honey ,  it &apos;s us .  of course it &apos;s the shovel - killer .  
alright ,  lets say that it is him ,  would we not want the baby ?  no !  would we treat him any differently ?  
i &apos;d keep an eye on him !  we have to find out which one the father is .  
how ?  
i dunno ,  aren &apos;t there tests for these things ,  right ?  
yeah ,  but maybe we &apos;re just over - reacting .  
we will now count from one to five .  un ,  deux ,  trois ,  quatre ,  cinq .  
huh ,  un ,  blu ,  bla ,  flu ,  flenk !  
good job .  
thank you .   
hey joey .  
hey !  
listen ,  i feel really badly about yesterday and i thought about it a lot and ,  and i know ,  i was too impatient .  so lets try it again .  
oh ,  no ,  that &apos;s okay ,  i don &apos;t need your help .  i worked on it myself and i gotta say ,  i am pretty good !  
really ,  can i hear some of it .  
sure ,  sure .  ok ,    &quot; bleu de la bleu ,  de la blu bla bleu &quot;   see ?  
well ,  you &apos;re not ,   you &apos;re not .  .  .  you &apos;re not .  .  .  again ,  you &apos;re not speaking french !  
 oh well i think i am ,  yeah and i think i &apos;m definitely gonna get the part .  
how could you possibly think that ?  
hey rach ,  can you grab me a cup of coffee ?

you &apos;ve been quiet all morning .  is everything okay ?  
hmm - hmm .   
you sure you &apos;re alright ?  
 yep .  
 o - kay .  well ,  i &apos;m gonna go grab us some breakfast .   
fyi .  .  
 there it is .  .  .   
in the future ,  when a girl asks for some ill - advised sympathy sex .  .  .  just do it .   
 wait ,  wait ,   you &apos;re mad at me about last night ?  i was just trying to do the right thing .  
 really ?  well ,  it seems to me if you &apos;d done the right thing ,  i would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed ,  i would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied !  
 well .  .  .  
oh stop that !  
i can &apos;t believe this .  i was just being a good guy .  i treated you with respect and understanding .  
 oh ,  that is so hot .   
hey ,  i was looking out for you .  
oh ,  really ,  well ross ,  you know what ?  i am a big girl .  i don &apos;t need someone telling me what is best for me .  
i gotta say ,  i have not had sex a lot of times before ,  this is the worst ever .  
oh ,  really ,  really ?  well ,  it wasn &apos;t very good for me either .   
hey you know what ?  you know what ?  to avoid this little thing in the future ,  let &apos;s just say ,  you and me ,  never having sex again .  
what ?  
hey !  how was lunch ?  
 we had a good time .  by the way ,  i wanted to ask you something .  it would really mean a lot to me ,  if the baby was a boy ,  that you name him after my father ,  jiminy billy bob  
 oh ,  really ?  
no !   you we &apos;re right ,  that was fun !  i &apos;m gonna go finish packing .  
o - okay .   so ,  is she gonna take the test ?  
nope ,  she doesn &apos;t have to ,  i found out who the father is .  
oh god .  it &apos;s shovely - joe ,  isn &apos;t it ?  
 no it &apos;s not .  
how do you know ?  
well ,  it turns out that erica didn &apos;t pay much attention in sex ed class ,  because the thing she did with that prison guy .  .  .  it &apos;d be pretty hard to make a baby that way .

we close escrow tomorrow ,  so seeing another house can only confuse us ,  and we &apos;re easily confused .  we &apos;re not very bright .  
but what if it is better than ours ?  should we at least look ?  
what do you think pheebs ?  
well ,  i think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a baskin robbins .  .  .  anyway .  .  .  hey ,  isn &apos;t joey &apos;s agent estelle leonard ?  
yeah .  
she died .  
you &apos;re kidding !  
that &apos;s terrible !  
yeah ,  last saturday .  wow !  she was the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic .   oh ,  wait a minute ,  i read the wrong one .  
oh yeah ?  
yeah ,  she was just an agent .  
joey &apos;s gonna be *so* upset .  
i know .  *he* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the atlantic .  
well ,  we cannot tell joey about this .  he &apos;s already flipping out about everything that &apos;s changing .  this will push him over the edge .  
seriously ,  you don &apos;t think we should tell him ?  
well ,  not for a little while .  let &apos;s just give him a few days to get used to everything else .  
what if he reads it in the paper ?  
may i help you ?  
yeah ,  i &apos;m a friend of rachel green &apos;s .  uhm ,  actually we met at the christmas party about two years ago .  
oh right ,  uhm ,  don ?  
close .  ron .   
uh .  .  .  what can i do for you ?  
uhm ,  well .  .  .  i &apos;m here to see if you &apos;ll give rachel her job back .  
ah ,  did she ask you to come here and do this ?  
oh ,  no .  at first i have to get you to agree .  then we &apos;ll see if she wants to come back .  
wow ,  that is tempting .  
look ,  she loved her job here .  and let &apos;s face 
you &apos;re not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it .  isn &apos;t that true ?  
she is good !  
 huh ,  i took a shot there .  
but i &apos;m sorry .  there &apos;s nothing i can do .  .  .  ah ,  it &apos;s not true ,  there is .  .  .  nothing i want to do .  
i see .  .  .  thanks very much .   is this your son ?  
yeah ,  his name is ross .   what ?  
oh ,  nothing ,  its just ,  its close to ron .  does he .  .  does little ross like dinosaurs by any chance ?  
yeah ,  they &apos;re all he talks about ,  why ?  
how would he like to come with me to the museum of natural history after everyone else has left ,  just the two of us ,  and he can touch anything he wants .   .  i just heard it as you must have heard it and thats not good .  let me start again .  im a paleontologist ,  youll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones fossils !  
you can really arrange that ?  
you let rachel come back ,  and its done .  
well ,  i guess having rachel back wouldnt be the worst thing in the world .  
yeah !  yes !  thank you !  this is great .  thank you so much .  and i swear ,  your kid is going to have the time of his life .  
thats great .  i worry about little ross .  hes always reading ,  he &apos;s collecting rocks and hes obsessed with dinosaurs .  
hey phoebe .  
hey .  everything ok ?  
im just mad at my agent .  
estelle ?  why ?  
theres a part in a tv movie that i would be perfect for and i didnt even be put up for it !  shed better have a good reason .  
im guessing she does .  
well  im wanna hear it ,  because she keeps doing this .  
well ,  no ,  no ,  wait ,  wait ,  wait .  all right ,  i gotta go .  just listen .  promise me ,  that you will wait a minute before you call her .  
ok .  why ?  
because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason .   
i love that saying !   .  
hello ?  
i was just gonna call you !  thats weird .  
its a little coincidental ,  but believable .   .  listen ,  im sure youre wondering why i didnt get you an audition for that tv movie .  
yeah ,  actually i am !  
i guess i dropped the ball there .  whoopsie !  
thats it ?  you know ,  it seems all you do lately is drop the ball .  
dont take that tone with me .  who you think you are ?  alan lemond ,  the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic ?  
no ,  no ,  look .  all im saying is that youre my agent ,  ok ?  and youre not getting me into any auditions and im tired of it .  
what are you saying ?  
im saying that  .  this isn &apos;t working for me anymore ,  ok ?  estelle ,  youre fired .  goodbye .   .  
hi .  
hi .  
emma left her stuffed t - rex at my house .  you know she cant sleep without it .  
oh ,  well ,  shes asleep now .  stop forcing that thing on her .  
ok .  
oh ,  youre not gonna believe what happened to me today !  ralph lauren called ,  and gave me my job back !  
nooo !  
yee .  i mean ,  it was so weirdest thing .  they fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back !  i mean ,  that place must have been falling apart without me .  
so ,  youre not going to paris .  
no ,  im still going .  
wh whwhat ?  
when the louis vuitton people found out that ralph lauren wanted me back ,  the offered me more money !  isnt that great ?  
hi .  were buying the house next door ,  and we were wondering if we could just take a look around .  
oh ,  sure .  im showing it to someone else right now ,  but please ,  look around .  
thanks .  
it feels like were cheating on our house .  and if were gonna cheat ,  shouldnt it be with like a hot ,  younger house ,  that does stuff that our house wont do ?  
ours is so much better !  this living room is smaller ,  the dining room looks like a cave !  what a hole !  
so ?  what do you think ?  
love it !  
well ,  we already have one offer on it ,  and i think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one .  
they could be our neighbors ,  what are they like ?  
oh ,  the woman upstairs is very nice .  she and her husband have two kids ,  he &apos;s on wall street and she 
hey joey ,  want come with me to are you ok ?  
yeah ,  i just i just feel bad about firing estelle .  this is got to be killing her .  
no ,  that wouldnt kill her .  ordinary embolism might .  
i dont know .  shes got to be taking it hard ,  i was like her only client .  except for this guy who eats paper .  and im guessing he eats more money than he makes .  look ,  i know shes not a great agent ,  but she did stick with me for ten years .  im gonna call her and hire her again .  
no ,  no ,  no !  don &apos;t call her !  you wait for her to call you  
why ?  
because patience is the road to understanding  which  .  .  .  is the key .  .  .  to a happy heart .  
 you blow me away .  
 all right ,  so promise you &apos;re gonna wait for her to call you ?  
what a small world !  
and yet i never run into beyonce !  
you two know each other ?  
oh ,  we go way back .  before monica made an honest man out of him ,  chandler used to be my little love muffin !   .  so ?  are you guys thinking of getting this house too ?  ooh !  are we gonna have a bidding war ?  i &apos;d better warn you ,  i &apos;m a toughie  
 don &apos;t ,  don &apos;t !   
no ,  actually ,  we &apos;re buying the house next door .   
 why !  ?  
 i don &apos;t know why .  
ooh ,  that decides it then .  i was on the fence .  but knowing that you two would be our neighbors ?  ah !  now we have to get it !   ellen ,  we &apos;re going to talk numbers .   
this can not be happening !  
okay ,  the realtor said another couple made an offer .  maybe the janice &apos;s won &apos;t get it !  maybe the other couple will .  
the only way that that is going to happen ,  is if the other couple are the hitlers .  
 okay ,  okay ,   all right .  what if we got both houses ?  huh ?  we can turn this house into a guest house .  
that is a great idea !  and by the way ,  i don &apos;t mean to sound distasteful ,  but when did you start crapping money !  ?  
okay ,  you come up with an idea .  
alright alright ,  we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house .  we can still get out .  
but we love our house .  
will we love it so much with her next door ?  and she &apos;s gonna be louder out here too .  just the crickets and   &quot; oh my god &quot;  !  
okay ,  but if we don &apos;t get this house ,  she &apos;s stil gonna show up wherever we go !  i mean ,  at least if she &apos;s here ,  it eliminates the element of suprise .  i mean ,  never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body .   
 it &apos;s me .  ron .   look ,  i um ,  i now rachel turned you down but i think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back .  
this may surprise you ,  but re - hiring fired employees ,  is not my main job .  
just hear me out .  how would you feel about offering her a raise ?   
 not good ,  ron .  
perhaps i can persuade you .  what if you can give your son this  genuine pterodactyl egg  replica .  
 wow ,  that &apos;s pretty cool  
huh ?  so ?  we have a deal ?  
okay ,  you got it .  
yes !  yes !  
this is gonna make me very popular .  
oh ,   believe me ,  the ladies ,  they love it !  
 i meant with my son .  
joey ,  this is al t .  booker ,   the guy who eats paper .  i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve heard that estelle passed away .   i wanted to let you know there &apos;s a memorial for her at the westside chapel ,  tomorrow at ten .  hope you can make it .  
oh my god .   hello ?  
 joey ,  it &apos;s estelle .   
estelle ?  
yeah ,  i wanted to call and tell you that there &apos;s no hard feelings for firing me .  
 ok - ay .  i just ,  i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re calling me ?  
well ,  i didn &apos;t think i should just drop by .  .  .  
no ,  no ,  no !   don &apos;t drop by ,  don &apos;t drop by !  
anyway ,  you did what you had to do .  i &apos;m okay .  
can i ask you something ?  uhm ,  what &apos;s it like there ?  
 it &apos;s alright .  look kiddo ,  i gotta go .  good luck with the career .  you &apos;re gonna be huge .  
well .  .  .  i just talked to sid ,  we are definitely putting in an offer on the house .  .  .  a - a - and i &apos;ll bet we get it .  
the hitlers will be so disappointed .  
all right ,  i got to run .  tell monica i say goodbye .  and .  .  .  i &apos;ll see you later ,  neighbor .   
wait !  i just want you to know that .  .  .  i &apos;m so happy you &apos;re going to be here .  
oh ,  me too .  .  .   
because .  .  .  that way .  .  .  we can pick up where we left off .  
huh ?  
i never stopped loving you .  
oh .  .  .  my .  .  .  
yeah ,  yeah ,  yeah !  i want you .  .  .  i need you .  .  .  i must have you janice litman goralnik neihosenstein .  
chandler ,  what are you talking about ?  
now that you live next door ,  we can be together every day .  sid and monica never have to know a thing .  
i don &apos;t know what to say .  .  .  i mean ,  you know ,  obviously we have this .  .  .  heat between us .  
 obviously .  
but i love my husband .  and i know you love your wife .  now ,  i don &apos;t think we should get this house now .  
don &apos;t say that .  don &apos;t tangle the dream and take it away .  
chandler ,  one of us has got to be strong .  
i understand .  
although ,  maybe just .  .  .  one last moment of weakness .  .  .   goodbye chandler bing .   
hi !  
hey !  
you are never going to believe what happened to me today .  
what ?  
ralph lauren called again and they offered me more money .  
they did ?  
yeah .  it was the weirdest thing .  zelner called me and he said we &apos;ll do everything we can to get you back .  and that i should thank some ron .  .  .  i don &apos;t even know what department that guy &apos;s in .  
so ,  what are you gonna do ?

uhm ,  i hadn &apos;t no you .  .  .  i had no idea you were so excited about paris .  uhm ,  i mean ,  you said you were scared .  
well yeah ,  but i mean ,  it was good scared though ,  you know ?  like when i - moved - to - new - york scared .  or uhm ,  when i - found - out - i - was - gonna - have - emma scared .  .  .  but this is .  .  .  fine .  this is gonna be good .   
 you should go .  
what ?  
it &apos;s what you want .  you should go .  
you really think so ?  
i really do .  
but i already told zelner that i would come back .  .  .  
 i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll understand .  
all right .  all right !  i &apos;m gonna do it .  i &apos;m gonna go to paris .  
yeah .  .  .

here ,  let me help you .   
oh ,  wow ,  can you believe you &apos;re like three weeks away ?  
i know .  
you don &apos;t mind me touching your belly ,  do you ?  
no ,  i don &apos;t mind you touching my belly ,  but right now your hand is kind of blocking the part where the baby is gonna come out .   
hey !  
hi .  
hey erica ,  welcome back to town !   wow ,  look how big you &apos;ve gotten .  
that &apos;s because i &apos;m pregnant !

no ,  no ,  i knew  .  staring at them .  
she brought them up !   i didn &apos;t realize you were coming back so soon !  
hey ,  well ,  in a couple of weeks i won &apos;t be able to travel .  
yeah ,  and i wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel .  
hotel ?  why isn &apos;t she staying with you guys ?  
because we &apos;re moving in a couple of days and it just didn &apos;t make sense .  
plus hotels are fun !  my room has this little fridge full of free snacks !  
erica ,  those things aren &apos;t free .  in fact they have one of the highest mark - ups of any consumer product .  .  .  
ross !  she &apos;s giving us her baby .  she can eat you if she wants .  back .  
oh man ,  i can &apos;t believe you guys are leaving this place .  
oh ,  i know .  i know .  hey ,  you know ,  you can take it if you want !  the lease is still in nana &apos;s name .  
no ,  no .  this will always be your place .  it would be too sad .  plus ,  how much a month does it cost to feed joey ?  
yeah ,  it takes two incomes .  
hey ,  is chandler here ?  we talked about catching a movie .  
oh ,  no .  he doesn &apos;t have time for that .  but if you want ,  you can go help him and joey pack up the guest room .  
mhm ,   packing  -  sexy cheerleader comedy .  
what are you guys doing ?  
try it ,  i can &apos;t feel a thing !   you kidding ?  this is packing ?  
we &apos;re taking a break !  
from ?  
jumping on the bed ?  
all right ,  rachel &apos;s party is in a couple of hours and there &apos;s a lot to do .  now ,  ross ,  you got geller blood ,  you &apos;re in charge of these yahoos !  
you got it !   .  all right ,  she &apos;s right ,  we gotta get serious .   let &apos;s put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him !  
no ,  no ,  no ,  guys .  she &apos;s right .  we should get to work .  i &apos;ll take stuff out of the closet ,  joey you pack  &apos;em and ross you re - pack whatever joey packs .

 what the hell is this ?  
hey !  handcuffs !  and fur line ,  nice !  i didn &apos;t know you guys had it in ya !  
chandler ,  you don &apos;t have a sister so you can &apos;t understand how much this bums me out .  
i didn &apos;t know monica had these !  
mhm ,  maybe she used them with another boyfriend .  maybe richard !  
why would she use them with richard and not me ?  i can be kinky !  i once did a naked dance for her .  .  .  with scarves !  
hey !  
hey !  where &apos;s mike ?  
oh ,  he has a gig .  i kinda like being married to a rock star ,  you know .  my husband has a gig .  
yeah ?  yeah ,  where is it ?  
oh ,  he &apos;s playing organ for a children &apos;s roller - skating party .  
rock on !  wow ,  this is quite a spread !   what is all this stuff ?  
well ,  i thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that i smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust ,  kidney beans in their own juices ,  and for dessert ,  a questionable orange .  
 hey .  
hey .  
hey ,  where &apos;s rach ?  
oh ,  she &apos;s putting emma down ,  she &apos;ll be over in a second .  
great .  
now it just hit her that she &apos;s leaving and she &apos;s kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off ,  ok ?  
yeah .   
hey rach ,  hey you .  
here she is !  
what did i just say ?  
no ,  no ,  no .  it &apos;s ok .  i &apos;m gonna be fine .  
come here ,  i &apos;ll make you a drink .  
oh ,  man !  i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s actually leaving .  how am i gonna say goodbye to rachel ?  
i know ,  she &apos;s been such a big part of my life .  and it feels like when melrose place got cancelled .   i mean .  .  .  oh ,  forget it .  i miss melrose place !  chance to stop her too !  
yeah ?  
who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row ?  head she wins ,  tails i lose .   wait a minute .  .  .

i &apos;m gonna miss you so much .  
i know .  
you know what ?  uhm ,  i have some goodbye stuff that i wanted to say to each of you and i was gonna save it until the end of the night ,  but come here  .  
hey ,  what do you think they &apos;re doing in there ?  
oh ,  pheebs ,  i don &apos;t even know where to start .  
ok well ,  before you do ,  i know we weren &apos;t supposed to get you going away presents ,   but i do have something for you .  
oh ,  oh .   .  what is this ?  
it &apos;s a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it ,  so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there ,  you can use the dna to create your own pheebs !  
chandler ?  i was just in our bedroom and i found these  on my pillow .  
oh ,  yes .  i decided to leave these out for you in case richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play !  
what are you talking about ?  these aren &apos;t mine .  
oh yeah ,  right !  good luck getting another scarf dance from me !  
that would be a terrible punishment .  but ,  i &apos;m serious ,  i &apos;ve never seen these before .  
really ?  then what are they doing in our guestroom ?  
rachel used to live in that room .  
rachel .  .  .  with handcuffs !  interesting !

yeah ,  i know ,  it &apos;s gonna be even worse for you .  .  .  god .  .  .  ross ,  get ready to do some serious crying .  
mon .  .  .  okay .  .  .  i &apos;ve gotta .  .  .  just say what it is i &apos;m gonna say .  .  .  none of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years ,  would have happened if it wasn &apos;t for you .  no - one has been more like a sister to me .  .  .  
i know what you mean .  you &apos;re like a sister to me too .  
 i wouldn &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna do without you .  .  .  
 you &apos;re the best friend i ever had .  
 
what ?  
i .  .  .  i .  .  .  i .  .  .   
 oh no ,  she took down monica .  .  .  and i &apos;m the crier in the family .  oh god !  i could be next .  maybe she won &apos;t talk with me if it looks like we &apos;re deep in converstation .  oh ,  so that thing you said about the thing .  it really made me think about that other thing .  
uh ,  rach ?  
well it &apos;s okay .  chandler is talking to her .  
i really made you think about that thing uh ?  
 uh ,  rach .  .  .  i think i have something that belongs to you .   
 oh ,  i &apos;m sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that i don &apos;t get .  
no ,  no ,  no .  .  .  they &apos;re really yours .  we .  .  .  found them in your old room .  
well ,  these aren &apos;t mine .  maybe monica used to use them with .  .  .  
don &apos;t say richard !  well ,  if they &apos;re not monica &apos;s and they &apos;re not yours ,  then whose are they ?  
well ,  i think you &apos;re forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room .  
pheebs !  
 yeah !  
i think these are yours .  
these are not mine .  .  .  look how flimsy they are ,  come on !  good god !  you try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these ,  they &apos;ll snap like a piece of licorice .  
 can i talk to you alone for a minute ?  
sure .   you don &apos;t really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you ?  
oh honey .  .  .  
let me just say something .  .  .  because once we get into this ,  i &apos;m gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke .  .  .  i just want to say that i .  .  .  i love you .  .  .  and ,  i &apos;m gonna miss you .  and i &apos;m so sad that you &apos;re leaving .  
 oh ,  you know what ?  let &apos;s not say anything else .  i love you .   
ooh ,  not so tight .  .  .   i &apos;m sorry ,  just give me one more chance .  
okay .  oh .  .  .   
oh !  
 so ,  i guess you &apos;re next .  you &apos;re ready ?  
i don &apos;t think so .  
oh ,  you &apos;re definately not .  i haven &apos;t cried like that in years .  
you cried yesterday at the six o &apos;clock news .  
that old woman was being scammed by her mechanic .

oh .  .  .   well .  .  .

oh ,  you guys .  this was an amazing night .  thank you so much .  i love you .  good night .   
what ?  i don &apos;t get a goodbye ?  
unbelievable .  she says goodbye to everyone but me .  
well ,  maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be ,  you know ,  implicit .  
well ,  it needs to be plicit .  
all right ,  let &apos;s think about this .  i mean ,  there &apos;s got to be an explanation .  uh .  .  .  did you do anything to make her mad ?  
no ,  i don &apos;t think so .  
you know ,  maybe she was just really spent from our talk .  it was pretty intense .  
yeah .  mine too .  
mine was a humdinger 
 o - kay .  .  .  i mean ,  don &apos;t i deserve anything ?  i mean ,  a few tears ,  a cursory hug ?   not from you !   
ross ,  if you &apos;re this upset ,  you should go and talk to her .  
and say what ?   &quot; you owe me a goodbye &quot;  ,  i mean ,  he &apos;s got more pride than that .  
the hell i do !   
i don &apos;t get a goodbye ?  
what ?  
 everyone gets a goodbye but me ?  what have i got to do to get a goodbye ,  huh ?  be best friends with you ?  uh ,  go out with you ?  have a baby with you ?  oh wait a minute ,  wait a minute ,  i did all those things .  
ross .  .  .  
i hope ross isn &apos;t too upset .  
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s not more bummed out than i am .  
tell me about it .  
well ,  you can &apos;t say we don &apos;t know how to throw a party .  
all right ,  i think i &apos;m gonna head out .  
uh ,  where do you think you &apos;re going ?  
i thought i was going home to go to bed ,  but i &apos;m sensing there &apos;s something less fun for me to do here .  
we &apos;re moving in a couple of days and we &apos;ve got a lot of packing to do .  it would be great if you guys could pitch in .  
joey and i can finish up in the guest room .  
oh ,  yeah ,  yeah ,  good idea .   
oh no !  you and phoebe are gonna help me in here .  
 you couldn &apos;t be cool .   
okay ,  we &apos;re gonna start in the kitchen .  plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box .  the silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped .  got it ?  
good !  now i need you to be careful and efficient .  and remember ,  if i am harsh with you ,  it is only because you are doing it wrong .  
hey mon ,  i think i figured out whose handcuffs they are .  
you did ?  how ?  
well ,  i was cleaning out the closet and i found some pictures of them .  .  .  being used .  
oh my god !  let me see .   
who &apos;s that dirty old lady ?  
monica &apos;s grandmother .  
nana liked it rough !

erica ,  are you okay ?  
yeah ,  you know ,  maybe i ate too much .  i keep getting these stomach aches .  they come and go like every few minutes .  
oh my god !

chandler ,  wait ,  wait ,  wait .  .  .  
what ?  
you really think i didn &apos;t say goodbye to you because i don &apos;t care ?  
that &apos;s what it seemed like .  
i cannot believe that after ten years ,  you do not know one thing about me .  
fine ,  then why didn &apos;t you say something ?  
because it is too damn hard ross .  i can &apos;t even begin to explain to you how much i &apos;m gonna miss you .  when i think about not seeing you every day ,  it makes me not want to go .  .  .  okay ,  so if you think that i didn &apos;t say goodbye to you because you don &apos;t mean as much to me as everybody else ,  you &apos;re wrong .  it &apos;s because you mean more to me .  so there ,  all right ,  there &apos;s your goodbye .  .  .  oh !  
rach !  
what ?  
you keep ,  you keep .  .  .  you can &apos;t .  .  .

all right ,  ready ?  
yeah .  all right ,  now give me your best shot .  
all right ,  here it goes .  .  .

yeah ,  you know ,  maybe i ate too much .  i keep getting these stomach - aches .  they come and go like every few minutes .  
oh my god !  
relax !  we &apos;ll just get her some antacids .  
she doesn &apos;t have a stomach - ache .  she &apos;s in labor !  
oh my god !   
so if you think i didn &apos;t say goodbye to you because you don &apos;t mean as much to me as everybody else ,  you &apos;re wrong .  it &apos;s because you mean more to me .  
rach !

you can &apos;t leave me alone with her .  
what ?  
this is exactly the kind of social situation that i am not comfortable with !  
what kind of social situation are you comfortable with ?  
it &apos;s just that we &apos;ve never spent any time ,  you know ,  alone together .  
you &apos;ll be fine .  nah ,  you won &apos;t ,  but i &apos;ll be back in two minutes .  
okay .   
so ,  ah .  .  .  any plans for the summer ?  
i don &apos;t know .  maybe church - camp ?  
hah .  may not wanna mention this .  so ,  you ever wonder which is worse ,  you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts ?  
what ?  
well ,  it &apos;s just interesting .  you know ,  because no one will ever know ,  because no one can experience both .   
morning .

it &apos;s my house - warming present for monica and chandler .  
it &apos;s a baby chick and duck !  
uh - huh .  and i named them chick jr .  and duck jr .  
i did not see that coming .  
yeah ,  i figure they &apos;ll love it at the new house ,  you know ?  it has that big backyard .  and then ,  when they get old ,  they can go to that special farm that chandler took the other chick and duck to .  
yes .  
yeah .  it &apos;s a shame people can &apos;t visit there .  
that is the rule ,  though .

oh my god .  you and rachel ?  
i know ,  it &apos;s pretty great .  
so what does that mean ?  are you guys getting back together ?

well ,  gosh .  that makes me feel so special and good .  
 wait ,  did you know it was twins ?  
yeah ,  it &apos;s here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in ohio .  
 anybody tell you ?  
i don &apos;t think so .  although ,  they did mention something about two heartbeats .  but i thought that was just mine and the baby &apos;s .  they kept saying both heartbeats are really strong ,  and i thought well ,  that &apos;s good  &apos;cause i &apos;m having a baby .  
this is unbelievable .  
twins actually run in my family .  
interesting !   can i see you for a second ?   
what do we do ?

 twins !  twins !  !  
chandler ,  you &apos;re panicking !  
uh - huh !  join me ,  won &apos;t you ?  !  okay ,  what do you say we keep one ,  and then just like have an option on the other one ?  
we can &apos;t split them up !  
why not ?  we could give each of them half a medallion ,  and then years later ,  they &apos;ll find each other and be reunited .  i mean ,  that &apos;s a great day for everybody .  
okay ,  what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible ?  
what if they &apos;re not ?  what if it &apos;s adopted by a king ?  
yeah ,  because i hear the king is looking to adopt .  
monica ,  we are not ready to have two babies !  
that doesn &apos;t matter !  we have waited so long for this .  i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s two babies .  i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s three babies !  i don &apos;t care if the entire cast of  &quot; eight is enough &quot;  comes out of there !  we are taking them home ,  because they are our children !  
 okay .  shhh .  .  .   
okay .  
okay !

come on ,  erica ,  start pushing again now .  
ow !   
here she comes !  
 she ?  it &apos;s a girl ?  
yeah .  
and then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye .  
oh my god !  what did you say ?  
nothing !  what do you say to that ?  
ross ,  you &apos;ve got to tell her how you feel !  
no way !  
you can &apos;t just give up !  is that what a dinosaur would do ?  
what ?  
dude ,  i &apos;m just trying to speak your language .  
ross ,  rachel doesn &apos;t know that you wanna get back together .  if she did ,  she might feel differently .  she might not even go .  
you really think so ?  
i &apos;m telling you !  oh ,  okay !  this is the part of the musical where there &apos;d be a really good convincing song .    &quot; bam - bam ,  don &apos;t take no for an answer .  bam - bam ,  don &apos;t let love fly away .  bam - bam - bam - bam .  .  .  &quot;

hey !  
hi !  so i just dropped emma off at my mom &apos;s .  
okay .  
oh ,  you &apos;re not taking her with you tonight ?  
no ,  we decided that i would go ahead and set up first ,  and then my mom would bring emma to paris on sunday .  
wow ,  eight hour flight with a one - year old ?  good luck ,  mom .  
are you kidding ?  eight hours with my mother talking about atkins ?  good luck ,  emma !

 gunther .  .  .  oh .  .  .  i love you too .  probably not in the same way ,  but i do .  and ,  and when i &apos;m in a caf ,  having coffee ,  or i see a man with hair brighter than the sun ,  i &apos;ll think of you .  aw .   
oh .  .  .  bye guys .   
oh my god !  
unbelievable !  
hey ,  you know what might help ?  
do you think they recognize each other from in there ?  
maybe .  unless they &apos;re like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years ,  and then one day they &apos;re pushed through a vagina and they meet .  
we &apos;re going to take erica to recovery now .  
there &apos;s something that we wanna tell you .  we decided to name the girl - baby erica .

if that falls off the truck ,  it wouldn &apos;t be the worst thing .   
wow .  
i know .  it seems smaller somehow .  
has it always been purple ?  
 look around ,  you guys .  this was your first home .  and it was a happy place ,  filled with love and laughter .  but more important ,  because of rent control ,  it was a friggin &apos; steal !   
hey ,  do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment ?  
oh ,  yeah ,  that &apos;s true .  
uh ,  i haven &apos;t .  
wait a minute .  what about that summer during college that you lived with grandma ,  and you tried to make it as a dancer ?  
do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up ?  
oh ,  honey ,  i forgot .  i promised treeger that we &apos;d leave our keys .  
oh ,  okay .   
so ,  i guess this is it .  
yeah .  i guess so .  
 this is harder than i thought it would be .  
oh ,  it &apos;s gonna be okay .   
 do you guys have to go to the new house right away ,  or do you have some time ?  
we got some time .  
okay ,  should we get some coffee ?

oh my god !  
relax !  we &apos;ll just get her some antacids .  
she doesn &apos;t have a stomach - ache .  she &apos;s in labor !  
oh my god !   
so if you think i didn &apos;t say goodbye to you because you don &apos;t mean as much to me as everybody else ,  you &apos;re wrong .  it &apos;s because you mean more to me .  
rach !  
hey .

oh .  this was amazing .  
it really was .  you &apos;ve learned some new moves !

alright ,  i &apos;ll be right back .  
where are you going ?  
to use the bathroom .  
you can &apos;t leave me alone with her .  
what ?  
this is exactly the kind of social situation that i am not comfortable with !  
what kind of social situation are you comfortable with ?  
it &apos;s just that we &apos;ve never spent any time ,  you know ,  alone together .  
you &apos;ll be fine .  nah ,  you won &apos;t ,  but i &apos;ll be back in two minutes .  
okay .   
so ,  ah .  .  .  any plans for the summer ?  
i don &apos;t know .  maybe church - camp ?  
hah .  may not wanna mention this .  so ,  you ever wonder which is worse ,  you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts ?  
what ?  
well ,  it &apos;s just interesting .  you know ,  because no one will ever know ,  because no one can experience both .   
morning .  
hey !  
what &apos;s that ?  
it &apos;s my house - warming present for monica and chandler .  
it &apos;s a baby chick and duck !  
uh - huh .  and i named them chick jr .  and duck jr .  
i did not see that coming .  
yeah ,  i figure they &apos;ll love it at the new house ,  you know ?  it has that big backyard .  and then ,  when they get old ,  they can go to that special farm that chandler took the other chick and duck to .  
yes .  
yeah .  it &apos;s a shame people can &apos;t visit there .  
that is the rule ,  though .

oh my god .  you and rachel ?  
i know ,  it &apos;s pretty great .  
so what does that mean ?  are you guys getting back together ?

it &apos;s just a little bit more ,  honey .

well ,  gosh .  that makes me feel so special and good .  
 wait ,  did you know it was twins ?  
yeah ,  it &apos;s here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in ohio .  
 anybody tell you ?  
i don &apos;t think so .  although ,  they did mention something about two heartbeats .  but i thought that was just mine and the baby &apos;s .  they kept saying both heartbeats are really strong ,  and i thought well ,  that &apos;s good  &apos;cause i &apos;m having a baby .  
this is unbelievable .  
twins actually run in my family .  
interesting !   can i see you for a second ?   
what do we do ?

 twins !  twins !  !  
chandler ,  you &apos;re panicking !  
uh - huh !  join me ,  won &apos;t you ?  !  okay ,  what do you say we keep one ,  and then just like have an option on the other one ?  
we can &apos;t split them up !  
why not ?  we could give each of them half a medallion ,  and then years later ,  they &apos;ll find each other and be reunited .  i mean ,  that &apos;s a great day for everybody .  
okay ,  what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible ?  
what if they &apos;re not ?  what if it &apos;s adopted by a king ?  
yeah ,  because i hear the king is looking to adopt .  
monica ,  we are not ready to have two babies !  
that doesn &apos;t matter !  we have waited so long for this .  i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s two babies .  i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s three babies !  i don &apos;t care if the entire cast of  &quot; eight is enough &quot;  comes out of there !  we are taking them home ,  because they are our children !  
 okay .  shhh .  .  .   
okay .  
okay !

come on ,  erica ,  start pushing again now .  
ow !   
here she comes !  
 she ?  it &apos;s a girl ?  
yeah .  
and then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye .  
oh my god !  what did you say ?  
nothing !  what do you say to that ?  
ross ,  you &apos;ve got to tell her how you feel !  
no way !  
you can &apos;t just give up !  is that what a dinosaur would do ?  
what ?  
dude ,  i &apos;m just trying to speak your language .  
ross ,  rachel doesn &apos;t know that you wanna get back together .  if she did ,  she might feel differently .  she might not even go .  
you really think so ?  
i &apos;m telling you !  oh ,  okay !  this is the part of the musical where there &apos;d be a really good convincing song .    &quot; bam - bam ,  don &apos;t take no for an answer .  bam - bam ,  don &apos;t let love fly away .  bam - bam - bam - bam .  .  .  &quot;   
hi !  
can &apos;t a girl finish a song around here ?  
hey !  
hi !  so i just dropped emma off at my mom &apos;s .  
okay .  
oh ,  you &apos;re not taking her with you tonight ?  
no ,  we decided that i would go ahead and set up first ,  and then my mom would bring emma to paris on sunday .  
wow ,  eight hour flight with a one - year old ?  good luck ,  mom .  
are you kidding ?  eight hours with my mother talking about atkins ?  good luck ,  emma !   
alright ,  you know what ?  you &apos;re right .  i should at least tell her how i feel .   
ross ,  wait !

rachel ?  
yeah ?  
i .  .  .  i know you &apos;re leaving tonight ,  but i just have to tell you .  i love you .   
i .  .  .  i don &apos;t know if that changes your plans at all ,  but i thought you should know .  
 gunther .  .  .  oh .  .  .  i love you too .  probably not in the same way ,  but i do .  and ,  and when i &apos;m in a caf ,  having coffee ,  or i see a man with hair brighter than the sun ,  i &apos;ll think of you .  aw .   
oh .  .  .  bye guys .   
oh my god !  
unbelievable !  
hey ,  you know what might help ?  
do you think they recognize each other from in there ?  
maybe .  unless they &apos;re like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years ,  and then one day they &apos;re pushed through a vagina and they meet .
