uh ,  no .  loosely translated  &apos;we should do this again &apos; means  &apos;you will never see me naked &apos; .  
since when ?  
since always .  it &apos;s like dating language .  y &apos;know ,  like  &apos;it &apos;s not you &apos; means  &apos;it is you &apos; .  
or  &apos;you &apos;re such a nice guy &apos; means  &apos;i &apos;m gonna be dating leather - wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you &apos; .  
or ,  or ,  y &apos;know ,  um ,   &apos;i think we should see other people &apos; means  &apos;ha ,  ha ,  i already am &apos; .  
and everybody knows this ?  
yeah .  cushions the blow .  
yeah ,  it &apos;s like when you &apos;re a kid ,  and your parents put your dog to sleep ,  and they tell you it went off to live on some farm .  
that &apos;s funny ,  that ,  no ,  because ,  uh ,  our parents actually did ,  uh ,  send our dog off to live on a farm .  
uh ,  ross .  
 &quot; so how does it feel knowing you &apos;re about to die ?  &quot;
