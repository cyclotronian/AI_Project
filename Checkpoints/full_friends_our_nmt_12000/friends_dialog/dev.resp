<ross> well ,  carol says she and susan want me to be involved ,  but if i &apos;m not comfortable with it ,  i don &apos;t have to be involved .  .  basically it &apos;s entirely up to me .  
<phoebe> she is so great !  i miss her .

<monica> i know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish ,  but ,  were you planning on bringing up the whole baby / lesbian thing ?  because i think it might take some of the heat off me .

<s> i &apos;m not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding .  .  .  but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money !

<monica> what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?  
<s> nothing !  it &apos;s an expression .  
<monica> no it &apos;s not .  
<s> don &apos;t listen to your mother .  you &apos;re independent ,  and you always have been !  even when you were a kid .  .  .  and you were chubby ,  and you had no friends ,  you were just fine !  and you would read alone in your room ,  and your puzzles .  .  .  
<s> look ,  there are people like ross who need to shoot for the stars ,  with his museum ,  and his papers getting published .  other people are satisfied with staying where they are -  i &apos;m telling you ,  these are the people who never get cancer .  
<s>  .  .  . and i read about these women trying to have it all ,  and i thank god  &apos;our little harmonica &apos; doesn &apos;t seem to have that problem .  
<monica>  so ,  ross ,  what &apos;s going on with you ?  any stories ?   no news ,  no little anecdotes to share with the folks ?  
<ross>  okay !  okay .   look ,  i ,  uh -  i realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between carol and me ,  and ,  so ,  well ,  here &apos;s the deal .  carol &apos;s a lesbian .  she &apos;s living with a woman named susan .  she &apos;s pregnant with my child ,  and she and susan are going to raise the baby .
