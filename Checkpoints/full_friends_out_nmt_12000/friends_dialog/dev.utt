all right joey ,  be nice .  so does he have a hump ?  a hump and a hairpiece ?

just ,   &apos;cause ,  i don &apos;t want her to go through what i went through with carl -  oh !  
okay ,  everybody relax .  this is not even a date .  it &apos;s just two people going out to dinner and -  not having sex .

all of a sudden ,  the phone starts to ring .  now i don &apos;t know what to do ,  everybody starts looking at me .  
and they weren &apos;t looking at you before ?  !  
finally ,  i figure i &apos;d better answer it ,  and it turns out it &apos;s my mother ,  which is very - very weird ,  because -  she never calls me !  
 hi .  
this guy says hello ,  i wanna kill myself .  
are you okay ,  sweetie ?  
i just feel like someone reached down my throat ,  grabbed my small intestine ,  pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck .  .  .

who wasn &apos;t invited to the wedding .  
ooh ,  i was kinda hoping that wouldn &apos;t be an and are trying to figure out what is going on . ]

i &apos;m thinking we &apos;ve got a bookcase here .

i would have to say that is an  &apos;l &apos; - shaped bracket .  
which goes where ?

done with the bookcase !  
all finished !  
 this was carol &apos;s favorite beer .  she always drank it out of the can ,  i should have known .

you guys .  
oh ,  god .  
you got screwed .  
oh my god !  
i know ,  i know ,  i &apos;m such an idiot .  i guess i should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week .  i mean ,  how clean can teeth get ?  
my brother &apos;s going through that right now ,  he &apos;s such a mess .  how did you get through it ?  
well ,  you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers ,  say her -  
 - leg ?  
 that &apos;s one way !  me ,  i -  i went for the watch .  
you actually broke her watch ?  wow !  the worst thing i ever did was ,  i - i shredded by boyfriend &apos;s favorite bath towel .  
ooh ,  steer clear of you .  
i &apos;m divorced !  i &apos;m only 26 and i &apos;m divorced !  
shut up !  
you must stop !   
that only took me an hour .  
look ,  ross ,  you gotta understand ,  between us we haven &apos;t had a relationship that has lasted longer than a mento .  you ,  however have had the love of a woman for four years .  four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out ,  and that is why we don &apos;t do it !  i don &apos;t think that was my point !  
you know what the scariest part is ?  what if there &apos;s only one woman for everybody ,  y &apos;know ?  i mean what if you get one woman -  and that &apos;s it ?  unfortunately in my case ,  there was only one woman -  for her .  .  .  
what are you talking about ?   &apos;one woman &apos; ?  that &apos;s like saying there &apos;s only one flavor of ice cream for you .  lemme tell you something ,  ross .  there &apos;s lots of flavors out there .  there &apos;s rocky road ,  and cookie dough ,  and bing !  cherry vanilla .  you could get  &apos;em with jimmies ,  or nuts ,  or whipped cream !  this is the best thing that ever happened to you !  you got married ,  you were ,  like ,  what ,  eight ?  welcome back to the world !  grab a spoon !  
i honestly don &apos;t know if i &apos;m hungry or horny .  
stay out of my freezer !   
ever since she walked out on me ,  i ,  uh .  .  .  
what ?  .  .  .  .  .  what ,  you wanna spell it out with noodles ?  
no ,  it &apos;s ,  it &apos;s more of a fifth date kinda revelation .  
oh ,  so there is gonna be a fifth date ?  
isn &apos;t there ?  
yeah .  .  .  yeah ,  i think there is .   - what were you gonna say ?  
well ,  ever - ev -  .  .  .  ever since she left me ,  um ,  i haven &apos;t been able to ,  uh ,  perform .    .  .  . sexually .  
 oh god ,  oh god ,  i am sorry .  .  .  i am so sorry .  .  .  
it &apos;s okay .  .  .  
i know being spit on is probably not what you need right now .  um .  .  .  how long ?  
two years .  
wow !  i &apos;m - i &apos;m - i &apos;m glad you smashed her watch !  
so you still think you ,  um .  .  .  might want that fifth date ?

yeah ,  right !  .  .  .  .  .  .  . y &apos;serious ?  
oh ,  yeah !  
everything you need to know is in that first kiss .  
absolutely .  
yeah ,  i think for us ,  kissing is pretty much like an opening act ,  y &apos;know ?  i mean it &apos;s like the stand - up comedian you have to sit through before pink floyd comes out .  
yeah ,  and - and it &apos;s not that we don &apos;t like the comedian ,  it &apos;s that - that .  .  .  that &apos;s not why we bought the ticket .  
the problem is ,  though ,  after the concert &apos;s over ,  no matter how great the show was ,  you girls are always looking for the comedian again ,  y &apos;know ?  i mean ,  we &apos;re in the car ,  we &apos;re fighting traffic .  .  .  basically just trying to stay awake .  
yeah ,  well ,  word of advice you &apos;re gonna find yourself sitting at home ,  listening to that album alone .  
no ,  it &apos;s good ,  it is good ,  it &apos;s just that -  mm -  doesn &apos;t she seem a little angry ?  
well ,  she has issues .

he &apos;s out banging other women over the head with a club ,  while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet !  
marsha ,  these are cave people .  okay ?  they have issues like  &apos;gee ,  that glacier &apos;s getting kinda close .  &apos; see ?

i &apos;ve already seen this one !   
 are you through with that ?  
yeah ,  sorry ,  the swallowing slowed me down .  
whose little ball of paper is this ?  !  
oh ,  uh ,  that would be mine .  see ,  i wrote a note to myself ,  and then i realised i didn &apos;t need it ,  so i balled it up and .  .  .    .  .  . now i wish i was dead .   
she &apos;s already fluffed that pillow .  .  .  monica ,  you know ,  you &apos;ve already fluffed that -    - but ,  it &apos;s fine !  
look  ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  guys ,  i just don &apos;t wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have .

monica -  hi !  um ,  monica ,  you &apos;re scaring me .  i mean ,  you &apos;re like ,  you &apos;re like all chaotic and twirly .  and not - not in a good way .  
yeah ,  calm down .  you don &apos;t see ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come .  
that &apos;s because as far as my parents are concerned ,  ross can do no wrong .  y &apos;see ,  he &apos;s the prince .  apparently they had some big ceremony before i was born .  
 ew ,  ew ,  ew ,  ew ew ew ew ew !

easy rach ,  we &apos;ll find it .   won &apos;t we !  
alright ,  when &apos;d &apos;ya have it on last ?  
doy !  probably right before she lost it !  
you don &apos;t get a lot of  &apos;doy &apos; these days .  .  .  
i know i had it this morning ,  and i know i had it when i was in the kitchen with .  .  .

now ,  monica ,  you know that &apos;s not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne .  .  .  
 i just .  .  .  can &apos;t do it .  
boys ?  we &apos;re going in .   
 .  .  .  .  . hi .  
wow .  that is not a happy hi .  
carol &apos;s pregnant .  
 ooh !  i found it !  
w - w - wh -  .  .  .  wha -  .  .  .  w - w - w -  .  .  .  
yeah .  do that for another two hours ,  you might be where i am right about now .   
kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective ,  huh ,  mon ?  
well now ,  how - how do you fit into this whole thing ?  
well ,  carol says she and susan want me to be involved ,  but if i &apos;m not comfortable with it ,  i don &apos;t have to be involved .  .  basically it &apos;s entirely up to me .  
she is so great !  i miss her .  
what does she mean by  &apos;involved &apos; ?  
i mean presumably ,  the biggest part of your job is done .  
anyway ,  they want me to go down to this -  sonogram thing with them tomorrow .  
so what are you gonna do ?  
i have no idea .  no matter what i do ,  though ,  i &apos;m still gonna be a father .   
 .  .  .  .  . well ,  this is still ruined ,  right ?   
oh ,  martha ludwin &apos;s daughter is gonna call you .   mmm !  what &apos;s that curry taste ?  
curry .  
mmmm !  
i -  i think they &apos;re great !  i ,  i really do .  
 do you remember the ludwins ?  the big one had a thing for you ,  didn &apos;t she ?  
they all had a thing for him .  
aw ,  mom .  .  .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  why is this girl going to call me ?  
oh ,  she just graduated ,  and she wants to be something in cooking ,  or food ,  or .  .  .  .  i don &apos;t know .  anyway ,  i told her you had a restaurant -  
no mom ,  i don &apos;t have a restaurant ,  i work in a restaurant .  
well ,  they don &apos;t have to know that .  .  .   
ross ,  could you come and help me with the spaghetti ,  please ?  
yeah .   
oh ,  we &apos;re having spaghetti !  that &apos;s .  .  .  .  easy .  
i know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish ,  but ,  were you planning on bringing up the whole baby / lesbian thing ?  because i think it might take some of the heat off me .  
what that rachel did to her life .  .  .  .  we ran into her parents at the club ,  they were not playing very well .  
i &apos;m not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding .  .  .  but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money !  
well ,  at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar .  .  .  
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?  
nothing !  it &apos;s an expression .  
no it &apos;s not .  
don &apos;t listen to your mother .  you &apos;re independent ,  and you always have been !  even when you were a kid .  .  .  and you were chubby ,  and you had no friends ,  you were just fine !  and you would read alone in your room ,  and your puzzles .  .  .  
look ,  there are people like ross who need to shoot for the stars ,  with his museum ,  and his papers getting published .  other people are satisfied with staying where they are -  i &apos;m telling you ,  these are the people who never get cancer .  
 .  .  . and i read about these women trying to have it all ,  and i thank god  &apos;our little harmonica &apos; doesn &apos;t seem to have that problem .  
 so ,  ross ,  what &apos;s going on with you ?  any stories ?   no news ,  no little anecdotes to share with the folks ?  
 okay !  okay .   look ,  i ,  uh -  i realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between carol and me ,  and ,  so ,  well ,  here &apos;s the deal .  carol &apos;s a lesbian .  she &apos;s living with a woman named susan .  she &apos;s pregnant with my child ,  and she and susan are going to raise the baby .   
your folks are really that bad ,  huh ?  
well ,  y &apos;know ,  these people are pros .  they know what they &apos;re doing ,  they take their time ,  they get the job done .  
boy ,  i know they say you can &apos;t change your parents ,  .  .  .  boy ,  if you could -    - i &apos;d want yours .  
must pee .   
y &apos;know ,  it &apos;s even worse when you &apos;re twins .  
you &apos;re twins ?  
yeah .  we don &apos;t speak .  she &apos;s like this high - powered ,  driven career type .  
what does she do ?  
she &apos;s a waitress .

chandler ,  you &apos;re an only child ,  right ?  you don &apos;t have any of this .

mm .  
so ,  got any advice ?  y &apos;know ,  as someone who &apos;s recently been -  dumped ?  
well ,  you may wanna steer clear of the word  &apos;dumped &apos; .  chances are he &apos;s gonna be this ,  this broken shell of a man ,  y &apos;know ,  so you should try not to look too terrific ,  i know it &apos;ll be hard .  or ,  y &apos;know ,  uh ,  hey !  ,  i &apos;ll go down there ,  and i &apos;ll give barry back his ring ,  and you can go with carol and susan to the ob / gyn .  .  .  
oh ,  you &apos;ve got carol tomorrow .  .  when did it get so complicated ?
