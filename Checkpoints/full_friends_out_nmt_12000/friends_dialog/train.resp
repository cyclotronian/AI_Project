<chandler> i &apos;d like to propose a toast .  little toast here ,  ding ding .  i know this isn &apos;t the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned ,  but for me ,  this has been really great ,  you know ,  i think because it didn &apos;t involve divorce or projectile vomiting .  anyway ,  i was just thinking ,  i mean ,  if you &apos;d gone to vail ,  and if you guys &apos;d been with your family ,  if you didn &apos;t have syphilis and stuff ,  we wouldn &apos;t be all together ,  you know ?  so i guess what i &apos;m trying to say is that i &apos;m very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked .

<joey> how do you get a monkey into a zoo ?  
<chandler> i know that one !   .  .  . no ,  that &apos;s popes into a volkswagen .  
<ross> well ,  we &apos;re applying to a lot of them .  naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos ,  y &apos;know ,  like ,  uh ,  san diego .  .  .  right ?  but that might just be a pipe dream ,  because ,  y &apos;know ,  he &apos;s out of state .  uh ,  my vet ,  uh ,  knows someone at miami ,  so that &apos;s a possibility .  
<chandler> yeah ,  but that &apos;s like two blocks away from the beach .  i mean ,  it &apos;s a total party zoo .   
<phoebe> hey .  we found her ,  we found the girl .

<monica> right .  till i bought a blow dryer ,  then i was shunned .  changed my life .  did you ever see dead poets &apos; society ?  
<monica> uh - huh .  i mean ,  that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can &apos;t be in the play ?  what was that ?  !  it &apos;s like ,  kid ,  wait a year ,  leave home ,  do some community theatre .  i walked out of there and i thought ,   &apos;now ,  that &apos;s two hours of my life that i &apos;m never getting back .  &apos; and that thought scared me more than all the other crap i was afraid to do .

<chandler>  what do you care ?  you &apos;re an actor .  this is your day job .  this isn &apos;t supposed to mean anything to you .  
<joey> i know ,  but ,  i was the best ,  you know ?  i liked being the best .   i don &apos;t know .  maybe i should just get outta the game .  they need guys up in housewares to serve cheese .  
<chandler>  all right ,  say you do that .  you know sooner or later somebody &apos;s gonna come along that slices a better cheddar .  and then where &apos;re you gonna run ?

<monica> me ?  what are you talking about ?  nobody could steal me from you .  i mean ,  just because i &apos;m friends with her doesn &apos;t make me any less friends with you .  i mean ,   you &apos;re my .  .  . we &apos;re ,  we &apos;re .  .  . oh ,  i love you .

<ross> it &apos;s the only possibility ,  phoebe .  
<phoebe> ok ,  ross ,  could you just open your mind like this much ,  ok ?   wasn &apos;t there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat ?  and ,  up until like what ,  50 years ago ,  you all thought the atom was the smallest thing ,  until you split it open ,  and this like ,  whole mess of crap came out .  now ,  are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can &apos;t admit that there &apos;s a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this ?   
<ross> there might be a teeny tiny possibility .  
<phoebe> i can &apos;t believe you caved .

<ross> would it matter ?  
<monica> oh ,  you are so great !   thank you !  
<joey> are you really not going ?  
<ross> i am really not going .  i don &apos;t get it .  they already live together ,  why do they need to get married ?  
<monica> they love each other ,  and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them .  
<ross> if you wanna call that a reason .  
<chandler>  who &apos;s the bitterest man in the living room ,  the bitterest man in the living room ?  hi ,  neighbor .  
<monica> ross ,  i thought you were over this .  
<ross> look ,  that has nothing to do with this ,  ok ?  she &apos;s my ex - wife .  if she were marrying a guy ,  none of you &apos;d expect me to be there .  
<joey> hey ,  if she were marrying a guy ,  she &apos;d be like the worst lesbian ever .  
<rachel>  did i miss it ?  did i miss it ?  
<joey> no ,  i &apos;m on right after this guy shoots himself .  
<chandler> whoa ,  she &apos;s pretty .  
<joey> yeah ,  and she &apos;s really nice too .  she taught me all about how to work the cameras ,  and smell - the - fart acting .  
<rachel> i &apos;m sorry ,  what ?  
<monica> what ?  
<joey> it &apos;s like ,  you got so many lines to learn so fast ,  that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one .  so while you &apos;re thinkin &apos; of it ,  you take this big pause where you look all intense ,  you know ,  like this .  
<chandler> oh ,  ok .  
<joey> there &apos;s my scene ,  there &apos;s my scene .    &quot; mrs .  wallace ,  i &apos;m dr .  drake ramoray ,  your sister &apos;s neurosurgeon .  
<joey> i &apos;m afraid the situation is much worse than we expected .  your sister is suffering from a .  . subcranial hematoma .  perhaps we can discuss this over coffee .  
<chandler> nice !  
<rachel> that &apos;s great !  
<ross> excellent !  
<chandler> for a minute there i thought you were actually tryin &apos; to smell something .   
<ross> that is so good !  do it again !  
<joey> all right ,  all right .   &quot; damnit braverman ,  it &apos;s right there on the chart !  &quot;

<ross> no no ,  that &apos;s me .  
<chandler> oh ,  yeah .  
<ross> oh ,  hello .  
<phoebe> oh ,  thanks .  i couldn &apos;t uh .  .  .  
<ross> is everything ok ?  
<phoebe> um ,  no ,  huh - uh .  one of my clients died on the massage table today .  
<ross> oh my god .  
<chandler> that &apos;s a little more relaxed than you want them to get .  
<phoebe> yeah ,  um ,  she was 82 years old .  her name was um ,  mrs .  adelman .  
<monica> oh ,  honey .  
<phoebe> yeah ,  it &apos;s just so strange .  i mean ,  she probably woke up today and thought ,   &quot; ok ,  i &apos;ll have some breakfast ,  and then i &apos;ll take a little walk ,  and then i &apos;ll have my massage .  &quot;  little did she know god was thinking ,   &quot; ok ,  but that &apos;s it .  &quot;  oh ,  but the weirdest thing was ,  ok ,  i was cleansing her aura when she died ,  and when the spirit left her body ,  i don &apos;t think it went very far .  
<rachel> what do you mean ?  
<phoebe> i think it went into me .    
<monica> god ,  this is so hard .  i can &apos;t decide between lamb or duck .  
<chandler> well ,  of course ,  lambs are scarier .  otherwise the movie would &apos;ve been called silence of the ducks .  
<rachel> ok ,  who ordered what ?  
<ross> oh ,  i believe i had the half - drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim .  
<chandler> yes ,  and this with the cigarette butt in it ,  is that decaf ?  
<rachel> oh god .  
<joey> i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re so uptight about your mom comin &apos; .  
<rachel> i know ,  but it &apos;s just it &apos;s the first time ,  and i just don &apos;t want her to think that because i didn &apos;t marry barry ,  that my life is total crap ,  you know ?  
<phoebe>  talk about crap .  try listening to stella niedman tell the story of her and rod steiger for the hundredth time .  
<joey> uh ,  pheebs ,  how long do you think this lady &apos;ll be with us ?  
<phoebe> i don &apos;t know .  i mean ,  she obviously has some kind of unfinished business .   sit up !  
<rachel> mom !  is it a restaurant ?  who can tell ?  but i guess that &apos;s the fun .  
<rachel> pretty much .  
<rachel> this is joey ,  and phoebe ,  and this is chandler ,  and you remember ross .  
<ross> hi ,  mrs .  green .   
<rachel> oh mom !  
<chandler> believe me ,  sometimes that happens .  father &apos;s house to the sorority house to my husband &apos;s house .  i am just so proud of you .  
<rachel> really ?  
<phoebe> i know who it is you remind me of .  evelyn dermer .   &apos;course ,  that &apos;s before she got the lousy face lift .  now she looks like soupy sales .  
<joey> pheebs ,  who &apos;s evelyn dermer ?  
<phoebe> i don &apos;t know .  who &apos;s soupy sales ?  [at rachel and monica &apos;s 
<rachel> yeah ,  well just be glad he &apos;s not playing a smaller instrument .  
<rachel> i know .  and mom ,  i realize you and daddy were upset when i didn &apos;t marry barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything ,  but this is just so much better for me ,  you know ?  you and i think ,  oh ,  this is what i want .  
<rachel> for .  .  . me .  
<rachel> well ,  what do you mean ?  
<monica>  all right .  tell me if this is too cute .  lesbian wedding ,  chicken breasts .  
<rachel> oh god .  i think i &apos;m gonna be sick .  
<monica> why ?  it &apos;s not like i &apos;m putting little nipples on them .  
<ross> and you had no idea they weren &apos;t getting along ?  
<rachel> none .  
<joey> they didn &apos;t fight a lot ?  
<rachel> no !  they didn &apos;t even talk to each other .  god ,  how was i supposed to know they were having problems ?  
<phoebe>  in my day ,  divorce was not an option .  
<joey> hey ,  look who &apos;s up .  
<rachel> i just can &apos;t believe this is happening .  i mean ,  when i was little ,  everybody &apos;s parents were getting divorced .  i just figured as a grownup i wouldn &apos;t have to worry about this .  
<monica> is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering ?  i mean ,  she &apos;s doing it because she wants to be more like you .  
<rachel> well ,  then ,  you know ,  couldn &apos;t she have just copied my haircut ?  
<chandler> you know ,  it &apos;s funny when my parents got divorced ,  they sent me to this shrink ,  and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves .  but in your case it &apos;s actually kinda true .  
<phoebe> that &apos;s him .  
<chandler> damn .  my mail order grandfather hasn &apos;t come yet .  
<phoebe> yes ,  hi ,  mr .  adelman .  thanks for meeting me .  
<phoebe> um ,  do you wanna sit ?  i do for you ,  my dear ?  
<phoebe> i don &apos;t know how to say this ,  but i think when your wife &apos;s spirit left her body ,  it um ,  kind of stuck around in me .  
<phoebe> yeah .  ok ,  you don &apos;t have to believe me but um ,  can you think of any unfinished business she might have had ,  like any reason she &apos;d be hanging around ?  she always used to say that before she died ,  she wanted to see everything .  
<phoebe> everything ?  
<phoebe> whoa ,  that &apos;s a lot of stuff .  
<phoebe> i &apos;m sorry ,  there &apos;s laughing in my head .   
<rachel> these are from halloween three years ago .  
<rachel> no ,  that was his costume .  see ,  he &apos;s actually an orthodontist ,  but he came as a regular dentist .  
<monica> um ,  you guys ,  you know when i said before ,   &quot; thank you ,  but i don &apos;t really need your help &quot;  ?  
<rachel> actually ,  what i think you said was ,   &quot; don &apos;t touch that ,  and get the hell out of my kitchen .  &quot;  
<monica> really ?  weird .  anyway ,  see ,  i planned everything really well .  i planned and i planned and i planned .  it just turns out ,  i don &apos;t think i planned enough time to actually do it .  
<rachel> hey ,  mon ,  you want some help ?  
<monica> if you want .  
<phoebe>  hey .  what a day .  i took her everywhere .  the museum of modern art ,  rockefeller center ,  statue of liberty .  
<rachel> she &apos;s still with you ?  
<phoebe> yeah .  i guess she hasn &apos;t seen everything yet .  i &apos;ll be right back ,  she has to go to the bathroom again .   oh ,  such a pretty face .  anybody have any marijuana ?  
<rachel> god !  
<monica> all right ,  look ,  nobody &apos;s smoking pot around all this food .  
<rachel> oh !  what &apos;s new in sex ?  
<monica> i &apos;m dicing ,  i &apos;m dicing ,  i don &apos;t hear anything .  might be more .  
<rachel> oh ,  i &apos;m sorry .  you know what ?  i cannot have this conversation with you .  i mean ,  god ,  you just come in here ,  and drop this bomb on me ,  before you even tell daddy .  what ?  what do you want ?  do you want my blessing ?  
<rachel> you want me to talk you out of it ?  
<rachel> then what ?  what do you want ?  
<rachel> why on earth would i understand this ?  
<rachel> oh .

<joey> woah ,  woah ,  woah ,  uh ,  no shannon cooper .

<monica> so what happened ?  
<rachel> my parents happened .  all they had to do was sit in the same stadium ,  smile proudly ,  and not talk about the divorce .  but nooo ,  they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address .  bishop tutu actually had to stop and shush them .  but you know what ,  you know what the good news is ?  i get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours .

<rachel> ya know ,  i just ,  so weird .  i mean i was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all i kept thinking about was the fourth of july .  
<chandler> becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other ?  
<rachel> it &apos;s just this thing .  every year we would go out on my dad &apos;s boat and watch the fireworks .  mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big .  my sister jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong .  but then when the fireworks started ,  everybody just shut up ,  you know ,  and it &apos;d get really cold ,  and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket .  it never occured to anybody to bring another one .  and now it &apos;s just .  .  .

<rachel> men are unbelievable .  
<monica> what is it with you people !  i mean ,  the minute you start to feel something ,  you have to run away ?  
<chandler> i know ,  that ,   that &apos;s why i don &apos;t want to go tonight ,  i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m going to say something stupid .  
<monica> oh ,  you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you .  
<joey> hey ,  you know about that ?  !  
<chandler> look what do i do ?  i wanna get past this ,  i don &apos;t wanna be afraid of the commitment thing .  i wanna go through the tunnel ,  to the other side !   
<ross>  where there is no fear of commitment .  
<chandler> do we have any .  .  .  do we have any thoughts here ?  
<joey> well ,  i &apos;ve never been through the tunnel myself ,   &apos;cause as i understand it ,  you &apos;re not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car ,  right .  but ,  it seems to me it &apos;s pretty much like anything else ,  you know ,  face your fear .  it have a fear of heights ,  you go to the top of the building !  if you &apos;re afraid of bugs .  .  .  .  . get a bug .  right .  in this case ,  you have a fear of commitment ,  so i say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was .

<s> oh ,  you didn &apos;t have to do this .  
<chandler> yes ,  i did .  yes ,  i did .  because ,  you &apos;re my girlfriend ,  and that &apos;s what girlfriends should ,  should get .  
<s> well ,  i gotta buy a vowel .  because ,  oh my gawd !  who ,  would &apos;ve thought that someday ,  chandler bing would buy me a drawer .  
<chandler> well ,  not me .  but that &apos;s what &apos;s happened ,  and ,  ah ,  and ,  and there &apos;s more .  we should take a trip .  
<s> we should ?  
<chandler> yep ,  we &apos;re a couple and that &apos;s what couples do .  and ,  i wanna meet your parents .  we should take a trip with your parents !  
<s>  i don &apos;t think we need to ,  because you &apos;re tripping me out right now !  are you okay ?  
<chandler> i am ,  i actually am .  i mean this is amazing .  my entire life i have feared this place ,  and now that i &apos;m here it &apos;s like what was the big deal .  i could probably say  &apos;let &apos;s move in together .  &apos; and i &apos;d be okay .  
<s> you probably want us to move in together ?  
<chandler> it doesn &apos;t scare me !  
<s> yeah ,  well ,  it scares me !  i mean i not even divorced yet ,  chandler .  you know ,  you just invited me over here for pasta ,  and all of the sudden you &apos;re talking about moving in together .  and ,  and i wasn &apos;t even that hungry .  you know what ,  it &apos;s getting a little late ,  and i - i should just ,  um .  .  .

<chandler> so ,  i finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down .  
<monica> that is never good .  
<chandler> then i got all needy and clingy .  
<rachel> okay ,  wait a minute ,  wait a minute ,  wait a minute .  maybe it &apos;s not so bad .  how did you leave it ?  
<chandler> she said she &apos;d call me .  
<chandler> oh god .  
<monica> welcome to our side of the tunnel .  
<chandler> this ice cream tastes like crap by the way .  
<rachel> yeah ,  well that &apos;s that lo - cal ,  non dairy ,  soy milk junk .  we sort of ,  we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases .  
<monica> you know ,  when you start get screwed over all the time ,  you gotta switch to low - fat .  
<rachel> yeah ,  you do .  
<chandler> so ,  you don &apos;t think i &apos;m terminal ?  
<monica> well ,  no ,  not at all ,  you &apos;re not terminal ,  you just ,  you just need some damage control .  
<chandler> okay ,  okay .  so ,  should i call her ?  
<rachel> this is a very critical time right now .  if you feel yourself reaching for that phone ,  then you go shoe shopping ,  you get your butt in a bubble bath .  you want her back you have to start acting aloof .  
<monica> she has to know that your not ready .  
<rachel> right .  so ,  what you have to do is ,  you have to accidentally run into her on purpose .  and then act aloof .  
<chandler> so i &apos;m not ,  not gonna lose her ?  
<rachel> oooh ,  honey ,  you &apos;re not a total loser .  
<chandler> i said ,   &apos;so i &apos;m not gonna lose her ?  &apos;

<ross> what ?  !  look ,  were trying to rebuild a relationship here ,  right .  how am i supposed to do that here ,  without being totally honest with each other ?  
<joey> look ,  ross look ,  im on board about this totally honesty thing ,  i am ,  just not about stuff thats gonna get you in trouble .  
<chandler> hes right .  nobodys gonna benefit ,  and youre just gonna hurt her .  
<joey> yeah ,  and there wont be a relationship left to rebuild .  
<ross> yeah ,  but dont you think .  .  .  .  
<chandler> all right look ,  if you absolutely have to tell her ,  at least wait until the timings right .  and thats what deathbeds are for .  
<ross> yeah ,  okay .   
<joey> all right ,  okay ,  now ,  we just have to make sure she doesnt find out some other way .   did you think about the trail ?

<phoebe> huh ,  well ,  the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial dont seem to think its that bad .  
<monica> thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid .  but hey ,  y &apos;know if you dont believe me ,  please ,  by my guest .

<chandler> yeah ,  its like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it !  
<phoebe> thats a good idea for a business !  
<chandler> im totally screwed .  okay ,  they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night ,  and then theyre gonna go to their cast parties and hes gonna try to undermine me .  y &apos;know itll be like ,   &quot; so wheres your boyfriend ,  whats - his - name ,  chester ?  &quot;  and shell go ,   &quot; no - no - no ,  its chandler .  &quot;  and hell go ,   &quot; whatever .  ha - ha - ha - ha !  &quot;  
<joey>  that - that is a good trick .  
<chandler> all right ,  look ,  look ,  what am i gonna do ?  
<joey> chandler ,  look theyre actors .  theyre there to do a job ,  just cause they work together ,  doesnt mean theyre gonna get together .  i mean just cause it happened with susan sarandon and tim robbins ,  it doesnt mean its gonna happen with them .  
<ross> oh - oh ,  alec baldwin and kim basinger .  
<joey> tom cruise and nicole kidman .  
<ross> yeah .  
<phoebe> hey ,  mel gibson and clint eastwood .  
<ross> theyre not a couple !  
<phoebe> oh - okay ,  i get the game now .  
<joey> okay look ,  look ,  let me ask you a question ,  when they were doing it on stage ,  was it like really hot ?  
<ross> oh yeah !  
<joey> well okay ,  so then youre fine .  the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off - stage all the sexual tension between them is gone .  okay ?  so as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about .  its when the heat goes away ,  thats when youre in trouble .  
<chandler> really ?  
<joey> look ,  you guys have been to every play ive ever been in ,  have i ever had chemistry on stage ?  
<ross> no .  
<joey> noooo !  !  
<ross> yknow what ,  i dont know how comfortable i am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend .  
<chandler> yeah ,  i know but 
<ross> oh no - no - no ,  im there .

<monica> oh ,  i was thinking about having people over for the game .

<ross> i had no idea .  and that - that pillowcase thing ,  i thought you guys were just doing the flying nun .  
<monica> sometimes we were .

<joey> no !  but y &apos;know ,  i &apos;m an actor ,  i &apos;ll act cool .  
<monica> rachel ,  if you want the little round waffles ,  you gotta have to wait until i find the little waffle iron .

<phoebe> umm ,  rachel and i were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights .  
<rachel> uh ,  thank you phoebe .  umm ,  well ,  what struck me most when reading jane eyre was uh ,  how the book was so ahead of its time .

<monica> a pill ?  
<ross> uh - huh .  well ,  when the psychiatrist told me i had to take a leave of absence because i yelled at my boss i started to get worked up again ,  so he offered me a tranquilizer .  and i thought was a good idea so ,  i took it .

<chandler> and you &apos;re okay with that ?  
<ross> i don &apos;t know .  it &apos;s going to be weird not having a job for a while ,  but i ,  i definitely don &apos;t care about my sandwich .

<joey> no !  if anyone &apos;s a sex addict here ,  it &apos;s monica !  yeah .  yeah .  she has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since london !

<rachel> what &apos;s up joe ?

<rachel>  yeah ,  well ,  y &apos;know umm no honey ,  listen i think it &apos;s a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them ,  but i think the way you do it is y &apos;know you meet someone ,  become their friend ,  build a foundation ,  then you ask them out on a date .  don &apos;t hit on your existing friends !  
<joey> won &apos;t - won &apos;t that take longer ?

<joey> i don &apos;t know .  but i can see through your sheet .   yeah ,  yeah ,  that &apos;s her .  but y &apos;know what ?  doesn &apos;t matter ,  i &apos;m never gonna get to meet her anyway .  
<monica> why ?  
<joey> because it &apos;s impossible to find her apartment !  she lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe ,  or something .  
<monica> what are you talking about ?   she obviously lives on the second floor ,  seventh apartment from the left !  
<joey> no .  no .  no .  she lives on the third floor ,  eighth apartment from the left .  
<monica> no ,  those first two windows ,   that &apos;s the lobby .  and y &apos;know the other one over there ,  that &apos;s the stairway .  you &apos;ve been counting wrong .  
<joey> i did not know that !  thank you monica .   i can &apos;t believe i almost lost another girl because of counting .

<ross> sure .   joey 
<joey> dahhhhh !  !   no !  noooo !  !   
<rachel>  okay .  umm ,  well ,  first i would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh ,  for yelling at you .  
<rachel> now you &apos;re probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah ,   who did ,  who did not umm ,  yell at you and storm out ,  and i think that &apos;s a big mistake and here &apos;s why .  i made a huge fool of myself and i came back ,  that shows courage .  when i thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job ,  i said no .  that shows integrity .  and ,  i was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage .   okay umm ,  now i know i already said courage ,  but y &apos;know you gotta have courage .  and umm ,  and finally when i thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace ,  i said no and i was not litigious .  {by the way ,  litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against .  so she didn &apos;t want to sue him .  don &apos;t worry ,  i had to look it up too . } so there you go ,  you got ,  you got  courage ,  you got integrity ,  you got  courage again ,  and not litigious .  look mr 
<rachel> zelner !  right !  i knew that !  i really ,  really want this job and i think ,  i think i would be really good at it .  
<rachel>  oh !  you are ?

<monica> really ?  
<chandler> yeah !  i &apos;ve never been in a relationship that &apos;s lasted this long before .  y &apos;know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time ,  i think that &apos;s pretty incredible .  and the fact that this is happening all with you ,  yeah i think that &apos;s pretty exciting .

<ross> all right ,  i gotta take off .  i &apos;m picking up ben then we &apos;re off to the big audition .  
<monica> it &apos;s gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be ben &apos;s dad .

<chandler> weirder than watching his two moms make out ?   
<joey> whoa - whoa dad ?  there &apos;s a dad in the commercial ?

<ross> yeah well ,  he &apos;s not gonna get this one .  ben is way cuter than that kid .  i mean look at him ,  look at you ,   
<joey> that &apos;s great .  listen ,  wouldn &apos;t it be great though if i got to play ben &apos;s dad ?  
<ross> joey ,  you look nothing like ben .

<rachel> i know !  it &apos;s like i &apos;m being punished for not having this disgusting ,  poisoning habit !  
<chandler> yeah ,  it is the best .  
<rachel> i mean what if this keeps happening ?  y &apos;know ,  they &apos;ll - they &apos;ll be outside smoking ,  making all the decisions and i &apos;ll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air ,  y &apos;know ?  and then when the day comes when kim wants to promote one of us ,  who do you think she &apos;s gonna pick ?  me or smokey smokerson ?

<rachel> okay ,  just a little scared .  what &apos;s going on ross ?  
<ross> the most amazing thing happened tonight .  i thought my number was up .  i had an actual near death experience !  
<rachel> what ?  !  what ?  what happened ?  !  
<ross> okay ,  okay ,  we were on the ride along with gary ,  right ?  
<rachel> yeah !  
<ross> and somebody took a shot at me !  
<rachel>  really ?  !  
<ross> no ,  a car backfired ,  but  i thought somebody was taking a shot at me .  and rach ,  i i survived !  and i was filled with this - this great respect for life .  y &apos;know ?  i - i want to experience every moment .  i want to seize every opportunity .  i - i am seeing everything so - so clearly now .  
<rachel> because a car backfired ?  
<ross>  okay ,  why are you here ?  
<rachel> well ,  i - i - i don &apos;t know how this fits into your whole  &quot; seizing &quot;  thing but um ,  emily called you today .  
<ross> you talked to her ?  
<rachel> no ,  she left a message .   but it - it kinda got erased .  there &apos;s just  something wrong with your machine .  
<ross> well ,  okay ,  what - what did she say ?  
<rachel> well ,  uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh ,  she wants you to call her .  
<ross> wow !  
<rachel> now ,  that - that was a good thing that i told you ,  right ?  
<ross> huh ?  yeah !  yes ,  of course !  
<rachel> okay .  thank you !  thank you !  becausei &apos;m sorry ,  all right .  because y &apos;know what ?  she didn &apos;t want menot important .  the point is ,  i was right .  your decision .  okay ?  i was right .   your decision .  
<ross> right .  i guess ,  i guess i should call emily .  
<rachel> okay ,  no ,  that &apos;s not the right decision .  that &apos;s not ,  that &apos;s not right ,  no ross - ross ,  come on !  i mean ,  that woman made you miserable !  okay ,  ross ,  do you really want to get back into that ?  
<ross> okay ,  look ,  yesterday i would &apos;ve even considered calling her back ,  but my ex - wife calls on the same day i have a near death experience .  i mean ,  that - that has got to mean something !  
<rachel> ugh ,  ross !  that was not a near death experience !  that was barely an experience !  
<ross> you weren &apos;t there !  okay ,  maybe this is something that i - i &apos;m supposed to seize !  y &apos;know ?  
<rachel> okay ,  y &apos;know what ?  maybe ,  this is not about seizing stuff .  maybe this is about escaping stuff .  
<ross> huh .  
<rachel> i mean ,  look - look today you escaped  death ,  y &apos;know ?  and maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with emily ?  
<ross> that does make sense .  because i do wanna seize some opportunity ,  but i - i really don &apos;t wanna see or talk to her .  
<rachel> well ,  there you go !  
<ross> yeah .  maybe today is just ,  close call day .  
<rachel>  close call day .  
<ross> hey ,  thanks rach .   
<rachel> ohh ,  honey no problem .  okay .

<phoebe> yes .  once .  yeah ,  a little .  he kinda did it to himself .  it &apos;s not really a good story .  
<ross> i wonder how i would react under fire ,  y &apos;know ?  and not backfire but - but heavy fire ,  like i was in a war or something .  
<monica> man ,  i would be great in a war !  i mean ,  i really ,  i think i would make a fantastic military leader .  i mean i know i would make general way before any of you guys .  
<chandler> before or after you were shot by your own troops ?  
<ross> i know where joey would be .  he would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us .  
<chandler> yes ,  if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches .  
<joey> yeah ,  hero sandwiches .   
<phoebe> well you all know that i &apos;m a pacifist so i &apos;m not interested in war in any way .   but y &apos;know what ?  when the revolution comes ,  i will have to destroy you all .   not you joey .

<chandler> i &apos;ll try ,  but i &apos;m not sure what good it would do ,  y &apos;know ?  because i &apos;m a lot less afraid of commitment than i used to be .

<rachel> all right listen ball boys !  my grandmother had one of these when i was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing !  i mean it was so cute ,  it would sit in my lap and purr all day long ,  and i would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it !  
<ross> free cats do that too ,  y &apos;know .  {which reminds me ,  if i might get a little political here ,  support your local animal shelter .  pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from ,  you get a much better deal from the shelter ,  plus they probably won &apos;t die on you in a week and a half .  if you want a leash ,  go to the pet shop .  if you want the dog for that leash ,  go to the shelter and save it &apos;s life .  now back to regularly scheduled programming . }

<s> oh ,  thats better then .

<ross> no problem .  
<s> and well need you and rachel to testify before a judge .  
<ross> ooh !  theres no way to do this without her ?  cause i kinda all ready told her uh ,  it was ,  it was already taken care of .  
<s> of course you did .  look ross ,  you cant get an annulment unless you and rachel are both there .  
<ross> uh - ha ,  what about someone who looks like rachel ?   i will think about the therapy .  
<monica> hey .  so um ,  i was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff .  
<rachel> okay !  
<monica> yknow ,  no point in dragging it out .  dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore .  
<rachel> okay .  
<monica> hey rach ,  what about this ?   huh ?  who - who gets this ?  see ,  i dont know if i want it because it might be yknow ,  too many memories !

<chandler> pheebs ,  i dont understand .  how can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about ?

<joey> hey rach ,  listen i was thinkin uh ,  im gonna have an extra room over at my place 
<rachel> oh ,  thats true .

<ross> hey !  
<phoebe> so ,  what did rachel say when you told her you were still married to her ?  
<ross> oh ,  that .  umm ,  she took it really well .  
<phoebe> you didnt tell her did you ?  
<ross> no .  
<phoebe> of course not ,  because youre in love with her .  
<ross> i am not in love with her .  she was very upset about having to move out so i eh ,  didnt tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset .  i - i just comforted her ,  as a friend .  
<phoebe> what do you mean ,  comforted her ?  
<ross> its nothing ,  i just gave her a hug .  
<phoebe> ah - ha !  a classic sign of love ,  the hug !  
<ross> its also a sign of friendship .  
<phoebe> yeah ,  not in your case lovey loverson .   
<ross>  it was a hug !  
<phoebe> okay ,  just tell me this ,  did you or did you not smell her hair ?  
<ross> s - s - smell her hair ?  what if i did ?  
<phoebe> ninety percent of a womens pheromones come out the top of her head !  thats why ,  thats why women are shorter .  so that men will fall in love when they hug them !   oh come on ross ,  youre a scientist .  
<ross> i was hugging her as a friend .  its not my fault her - her hair got in my face ,  shes got a lot of it and it smells all - all uh coconutty .   what ?  !  oh ,  that doesnt mean i have feelings for rachel !  maybe it means i have feelings for coconuts !  
<phoebe>  okay ,  whatever you say .  but just be careful ,  all right ?  rachels not in the same place you are .  
<ross>  if the place you are referring too is being in love ,  then she is in the same place as me because i am not in that place !  
<phoebe> okay ,  i didnt understand that ,  but yknow ,  maybe thats cause you were speaking the secret language of love !   
<chandler> who was it ?  
<joey> i dont know !  how about ,   &quot; thanks for taking the message .  &quot;  jeez !   
<monica> okay listen ,  yknow when you move in rachels room is gonna be empty ,  you wanna talk about what we want to do with it ?  
<chandler> sure !  
<monica> okay ,  i was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room ,  right ?  with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time !  and we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here !  !  okay ,  whatever ,  i really havent thought about it that much .  
<chandler> well ,  i like that idea .  obviously !  i was thinking maybe - maybe - maybe it could be a game room ,  yknow ?  i mean you can buy old arcade games like uh ,  like space invaders and asteroids for $200 ,  the real ones !  the big - big ones !  
<monica> no .  
<chandler> okay so you mean no as in ,   &quot; gee chandler ,  what an interesting idea .  lets discuss it before we reject it completely .  &quot;  
<monica> oh ,  im sorry .  of course i mean that .  interesting idea ,  umm ,  talk about it ,  but no .  
<chandler> so ,  thats it ?  
<monica> i just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room .  the beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques .  
<chandler> which is why asteroids is perfect !  its the oldest game !  
<monica> what do you have against the beautiful guest room ?  
<chandler> i dont have anything against the beautiful guest room ,  especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away !  
<monica> are you mocking me ?  
<chandler> no ,  im not mocking you ,   or you beautiful guest room .   
<chandler> nothing ,  monica and i had a stupid fight .  
<joey> but youre still moving in together ,  right ?  because my ad came out today .   
<chandler>   &quot; wanted .  female roommate ,  non - smoker ,  non - ugly .  &quot;  nice !  
<joey> yeah ?  i just figured yknow ,  after living with you itd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate ,  yknow ?  someone i can learn from ,  someone - someone whos different than me .  and whats more different than me; a guy whos not 19 than say a girl who is 19 ?  enh ?   not just a hat rack my friend !  
<phoebe> shhhhhh !  im swamped right now .

<monica> totally !   
<chandler> we dont have to come up with this now .  
<monica> oh good .

<phoebe> na - uh ,  no ,  we are all responsible for our own babies .  
<chandler> see thats where i think that youre wrong .  weve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense .  
<monica> what do you mean ?  
<chandler> i just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone .  phoebe ,  you can be in charge of wiping .  and yknow mon ,  you can be in charge of diapering and i can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around  
<phoebe> that sounds really great ,  but maybe you should be in charge of wiping .  
<chandler> okay ,  im a rookie .  i should not be in the end zone .  chandler adds the powder ,  begrudgingly ,  and monica puts the diaper on . ] 
<monica> this is so great !  this is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant .

<chandler> shocking !  since you still have the keys .  
<joey> you should see the treatment i get when im with that car !  people are friendly; they - they wanna talk ,  and not just about the car !  one guy gave me advice about my equity investments .  
<chandler> what equity investments ?  
<joey> the ones that got me the porsche !  will you keep up !   but i figured ,  if - if people keep seeing me just standing there ,  theyre gonna start to think that i dont own it .  so i figured ill wash it .  right ?  monica ,  you got a bucket and some soap i can borrow ?  
<monica> oh yeah ,  i got soap and sponges and rags and carnuba wax and polishing compound .  
<chandler> you dont even have a car !  
<monica> i know .  but umm ,  one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building ,  so i washed it .  
<chandler> and ?  
<monica> and six others .  
<chandler> there you are .  
<joey> and thats just in the city .  i get her up to 160 when i take her upstate .  
<joey> sure !  
<joey> okay ,  take it easy .

<joey> sure .  here .   ill uh ,  save your parking spot .  
<joey> why not ?  
<joey> yeah ,  so did i .   
<monica> yeah ,  two hours ,  a lifetime thats the same .  
<chandler>  check it out !  check it out !  when the babies wake up ,  they can meet krog !   
<monica> chandler ,  what are you doing ?  that thing can put someones eye out !  
<chandler> he can do more than that !  he can destroy the universe !  
<phoebe> no chandler ,  they can swallow one of those little parts !  and also ,  look at his smooth area ,  thats just gonna mess them up .  
<chandler> theyre not gonna swallow anything ,  you guys are being way over protective .  when i was a kid ,  my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass !  
<phoebe> what ?  !  
<chandler> glass ,  sand ,  whatever .   
<phoebe> oh ,  look at little leslie stretching in her sleep .  
<monica> oh its so cute .  i wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head .  
<phoebe> oh ,  i can still do that .  
<monica> how are you still single ?  !  
<chandler>  all right .   i thought about it and maybe youre right .  maybe krog is not a safe toy .  
<monica> good .  what made you change your mind ?  
<chandler> i swallowed the sonic blaster gun .  
<phoebe> how did that happen ?  !  !  
<chandler> well ,  i was trying to prove that i was right .  yknow ?  and it turns out i was wrong .  and now its lodged in my throat .   
<monica> damnit !  yknow this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and ,  and no one was watching chandler !   
<rachel> yes your honor ,  and here are ,  are forms ,  all filled out .  
<s> so based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that mr . _geller is mentally unstable .  
<ross> fine ,  im mentally unstable .  
<s> and based on the fact that mr . _geller is intravenous drug user .  
<ross> what ?  !  
<rachel> uh yes ,  heroin and crack .  
<ross> crack isnt even an intravenous drug !  
<rachel> well ,  you would know .  
<s> now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage ?  
<ross> oh ,  come on !  
<rachel>  ross ,  please ,  i found the magazines !  
<s> and finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage .  well ,  that makes sense since youre gay and addicted to heroin .  
<ross> okay ,  im sorry ,  this is insane !  i - i - im not addicted to heroin ,  im not gay ,  and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything !  look ,  ill consummate this marriage right here ,  right now !  
<s> that wont be necessary .  
<ross> and when we were dating we consummated like bunnies !  
<rachel> ugh !  
<s> now if you were two involved in a serious relationship ,  that really creates a problem .  
<rachel> ross !  your honor ,  rest assured relationship ended like two years ago !   and could you strike  &quot; consummated like bunnies &quot;  from the record ?  
<s> is there ,  anything in this record that is actually true ?  
<rachel> well ,  yes ,  we got married in vegas and uh ,  and the names i think .  
<s> well ,  based on what i heard ,  you two certainly dont qualify for an annulment .  if you two dont want to be together youll have to file for divorce .  
<ross>  thats great !  are you happy now ?  look what you did with your funny ,  funny form !  
<rachel>  what ?  !  me ?  !  what about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense !  
<ross> and whatwhat are you typing that for ?  did you hear what she said ?  we dont get the annulment .  dont type that !  what ?  !  stop typing !   hey !  stop typing !   stop typing !  stop typing !  !  
<rachel>  okay ,  do you see ,  do you see what youre keeping me married too ?  !  
<s> you need to get out of my chambers .  
<rachel> all right look lady here is the deal ,  i came here for an annulment and i am not leaving here until i get one !  
<ross> yeah !  
<s> would you like to spend the night in jail ?  
<rachel> and thank you for your time .   commercial break 
<chandler> but you found the keys to his clothes ?  
<joey> no .  no ,  i just uh ,  i just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks i own a porsche .  
<monica> and people will think you own a porsche because youre wearing the clothes ?  
<joey> of course !  only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car !  right ?  
<chandler> that is true .  
<phoebe> yeah ,  but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun .  
<joey> oh ,  ive been there .  yeah ,  i am gonna go drive my porsche .   
<monica> joey ,  you know you dont actually have one .  
<joey> come on !  what are you doing ?  !  im in character !  would you talk to her !   
<chandler> ahh ,  i think it just moved .  its really poking me .  
<monica> all right ,  thats it ,  were going to the emergency room .  
<phoebe> what ?  !  no ,  you cant ,  you cant leave me here with them !  were baby - sitting !  
<monica> the babies are asleep ,  im sure youll be okay on your own for a while !  
<phoebe> but you - you cant leave me with them !  we - were a team !  were playing a zone !  theyre gonna triple team me !  
<monica> hes got something plastic lodged in his throat ,  weve got to go to the hospital .  
<phoebe> but no ,  because a doctor wont be able to help him ,  its just gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years .  
<chandler> i think thats gum .  
<phoebe> im pretty sure its gun .  
<chandler> okay ,  listen this really hurts .  lets go .  
<phoebe> a real man wouldnt just run to the hospital !   no !  what would ,  what would krog do ?   
<s> maybe because youve got the keys ?  
<joey>  porsche .   
<rachel> this is totally your fault !  
<ross> my fault ?  !  you threatened the judge !  
<rachel> well ,  you ripped the paper out of the court reporters machine !  !  
<ross> that was the only way i could get him to stop typing !  
<joey> hi !  how are the gellers ?  
<rachel> dont call us that !   
<ross> the judge wouldnt let us get an annulment !  now we gotta get a divorce !  !  did a porsch throw up on you ?   
<joey> hey !  its porsche !  !   
<chandler>  hey !  
<phoebe>  how do you feel ?  
<chandler> well ,  lets just say that krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours .  
<phoebe> okay ,  so i totally took care of the babies all by myself !  i fed em ,  bathed em ,  and put em to bed .  
<chandler> and protected them from a tornado ?   
<monica> oh my god .  
<phoebe> i know ,  the babies are asleep .  
<monica> phoebe ,  what ,  what happened here ?  !  
<phoebe> i did it !  i took care of the babies all by myself !  
<monica> but my apartment !  
<chandler> was the setting of phoebes triumph .  
<monica> but the mess !  
<chandler> is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies all by herself .  
<monica> youre right ,  youre right i shouldnt freak out .  cause this is what will happen when you and i have babies !  when will that be ?  !  
<chandler>  phoebe ,  would you take a look at this mess !  !  !  !  
<ross> i picked up the divorce papers .  uh ,  ive already signed everything and i put little xs where you need to sign .  
<rachel> oh ,  little xs !  great !  that makes up for everything !  
<ross> yknow ,  i - iyouve done a lot of stupid stuff too !  okay ?  
<rachel> oh ,  name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one !  
<ross> okay ,  how about you flew to london to stop my wedding !  ah ,  how about you told me you loved me after i was already married !  
<rachel> hey !  wait a minute !  that was different !  i did those things because i was in love with you !  
<ross> yeah !  right !   
<ross> youre right .  thats very different .  so lets ,  lets just sign the papers .  all right ?   what ?  
<rachel> nothing .   
<ross> okay ,  can we just sign please ?  
<rachel> uh - hmm .   
<ross> congratulations .   
<rachel> okay ross ,  werewait a minute .  umm ,  i uh ,  i kinda have a little confession .  
<ross> what ?  
<rachel> well ,  yknow this whole marriage thing ,  kinda my idea .  
<ross> excuse me ?  
<rachel> well ,  remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married ?  
<ross> yeah ?  
<rachel> and uh ,  yeah ,  i didnt really ,  i didnt want to say anything ,  but it kinda it just ,  it kinda kept coming back to me ,  and umm ,  remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes .  and uh ,  and i thought it would be funnier if we got married .  so as a ,  as a compromise we decided first to get married ,  and then  to eat a lot of grapes .  so umm ,  sorry i got us into this mess .  
<ross> so then if - ifi mean if you think about it ,  this is all  your fault .  
<rachel> yeah ,  dont push it though .  
<ross> ive got to say; i know i divorce a lot of women ,  never thought i would be divorcing you .  
<rachel> i know .  i always thought if you and i got married ,  it would be the one that stuck .  and it wouldnt be a secret ,  and we wouldnt have our wedding dinner at pizza hut .   
<ross> did i ,  did i even treat ?  
<rachel> no ,  it was on the house ,  it was ,  it was a newlywed special .  
<ross> that may be the most depressing thing ive heard in my life .  i should probably get these to my lawyers office .  
<rachel> hey ,  thanks ross ,  for taking care of all of this .  
<ross> eh ,  no problem .   
<rachel> im gonna need a copy of those .  
<ross> totally .   ending credits

<chandler> and monkeys cant write out prescriptions .   
<chandler>  you are not allowed to laugh at my joke .  
<ross> your joke ?  well ,  i think the hef would disagree ,  which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah - dollars .  
<chandler> so ,  you stole my joke ,  and you stole my money .  
<ross> well ,  i was going to stick it in the atm ,  but now i think ill show the sexy teller that i am a published writer .

<monica>  it wasnt funny at all !  why would you do that ?  why didnt you pick me ?

<ross> monica !   
<chandler> okay ,  okay .  you have to help us decide whose joke this is .  
<monica> why do i have to decide ?

<ross> yeah .  
<monica> i cant be fair .  youre my boyfriend .  
<ross> yeah ,  but im your brother .  were family .  thats the most important thing in the world .  
<chandler>  dont try to sway her .   im your only chance to have a baby .  okay ,  lets go .  
<ross> well each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truthme .  
<monica> okay ,  chandler ,  you go first .  
<chandler> okay ,  i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve .  
<monica> oh ,  wait ,  is he the guy i met at christmas ?  
<chandler> can i finish my story ?  !  
<monica> do you want me to pick you ?  !  
<ross> see ,  i would never snap at you like that .   
<monica> continue .  
<chandler> so steve said he had to go to the doctor .  and steves doctors name is doctor muppy .  so i said ,  doctor monkey ?  and that is how the whole doctor monkey thing came up .   
<ross> are you kidding ?  okay ,  look .  i - i studied evolution .  remember ,  evolution ?  monkey into man ?  plus ,  im a doctor ,  and i had a monkey .  im doctor monkey !  
<chandler> im not arguing with that .  
<monica> all right ,  ive heard enough .  ive made my decision .   
<monica> you are both idiots .  the joke is not funny ,  and its offensive to women ,  and doctors ,  and monkeys !  you shouldnt be arguing over who gets credit ,  you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world !  now let it go !  the joke sucks !   
<ross> its your joke .  
<chandler> is not .  
<chandler> hi ,  oh hi .  
<monica> hey ,  its phoebe and rachel .  um ,  why dont you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance ?   
<chandler>  monica is a self - sufficient ,  together lady .   being with her has been like being on a vacation .  and what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail andgenerosity of spirit .  
<rachel> wow ,  you know what ?  that is the best fake speech i think ive ever heard .  
<phoebe> really ?  ive heard better .  
<monica> wait ,  wait ,  he came up with that himself .  tell them ,  chandler .  
<chandler>  im out of words .  should i just say the whole thing again ?  
<monica> look ,  i am not high maintenance .  i am not .  chandler !  
<chandler>  youre a little high maintenance .  
<monica> ahhh !  you are on my list .  
<chandler> im sorry .  youre not easy - going ,  but youre passionate ,  and thats good .  and when you get upset about the little things ,  i think that im pretty good about making you feel better about that .  and thats good too .  so ,  they can say that youre high maintenance ,  but its okay ,  because i like maintaining you .  
<monica>  i didnt even tell him to say that .   .  all right youre off my list .  
<chandler>  im off the list .   
<monica>  phoebe ,  its okay that you dont want me to be your girlfriend because i have the best boyfriend .  
<phoebe>  yknow ,  suddenly i find you very attractive .   
<chandler> hey ,  buddy boy ,  howd the audition go ?  
<joey> not good ,  no .  i didnt get the part ,  and i lost my job here ,  so

<rachel> oh !  i knew it !  what happened ?  
<ross> umm ,  she kissed me .  
<rachel> what ?  !  you kissed !  
<chandler>  maybe we should give them some privacy .  
<monica>  shhhh !  !  !  
<ross> look ,  i uh ,  i tried not to kiss her ,  okay ?  
<rachel> well ,  it doesnt sound like it !  i mean ,  its pretty easy not to kiss someone ,  you just dont kiss them !  see look at us ,  right now ,  not kissing !  
<ross> let me finish ,  okay ?  she started kissing me and - and i didnt stop it .  i guess i - i just wasnt thinking 
<rachel> yeah thats right you werent thinking !  yknow what ?  let me give you something to think about !   
<ross> oh waithold it !  but then i started thinking and i stopped the kissing .  
<rachel> oh ,  well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sisters mouth long enough to tell me that .  
<ross> look i - i realize if anything were to happen with me and jill then nothing could ever happen with us !  
<rachel> what ?  !  
<ross> no ,  i mean ,  look i dont know if anything is going to happen with us ,  again .  ever .  but i dont want to know that it - it never could .  so i stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector .  
<rachel> wow .  i ,  i dont even know what to say .  thank you .   
<ross> youre welcome .    
<monica> oh my god !  are - are you crying ?  
<chandler>  i just dont see why those two cant work things out !  ending credits 
<rachel> yeah ,  i got that .  
<s>  and you !  i throw myself at you and you say no ,  how gay are you ?  
<ross> you take care jill .  
<s>  okay ,  see ya !   
<rachel> bye - bye - e !  
<monica> bye .  
<chandler>  i - i cant believe jills gone .   i cant help it ,  i opened a gate .  first part of this episode is episode 615 .  the second part of this episode is episode 616 .  since episodes 615 and 616 are combined into one file ,  thats why there is no episode 616 in the season 6 table of contents and the numbers jump from episode 615 to 617 . } 
<monica> oh my god !  
<phoebe> wow !  
<joey>  what is the matter with you ?  !  
<phoebe> no !  barry and mindy .  
<joey> oh sorry ,  i hear divorce i immediately go to ross .   who - whos barry and mindy ?  
<rachel> barry was the guy that i was almost married and mindy was my best friend .  
<joey> ohh - oh ,  wasnt he cheating on you with her ?  
<rachel> yeah ,  but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me .  
<monica> why did they get divorced ?  
<rachel> well ,  apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else .  isnt that sad ?   god ,  could you imagine if i actually married him ?  !  i mean how different would my life be ?  
<ross> i know what you mean ,  ive always wondered how different my life would be if - if id never gotten divorced .  
<phoebe> which time ?  
<ross> the first time !  no seriously ,  imagine if carol hadnt realized she was a lesbian .  
<joey>  i cant .  i keep seeing it the good way .  
<ross> id bet id still be doing my kara - tay .   towards the end of our marriage i was doing a lot of kara - tay as a way of releasing the tension from yknow ,  not doing anything else physical .  
<chandler> maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara - tay .  
<monica> and what if i was still fat ?   well ,  you wouldnt be dating me ,  thats for sure .  
<chandler> sure i would !  
<s>  oh yeah !  come on !  yeah right !  
<chandler> what ,  you guys really think that im that shallow ?  
<ross> no ,  i just think monica was that fat .  
<joey> hey ,  imagine if i never got fired off days of our lives !   oh - hey ,  theres carol again !  
<chandler> what if i had had the guts to quit my job ?  id probably be writing for the new yorker ,  getting paid to be funny .  but my jobs fun too !  i mean tomorrow ,  i - i dont have to wear a tie .  
<phoebe> what if i had taken that job at merrill lynch ?  
<ross> what ?  !  
<rachel> merrill lynch ?  
<phoebe> yeah ,  i had a massage client who worked there and - and he said i had a knack for stocks .  
<rachel> well why didnt you take the job ?  
<phoebe> because at that time you see ,  i thought everything that rhymed was true .  so i thought yknow that if id work with stocks ,  id have to live in a box ,  and only eat lox ,  and have a pet fox .  
<ross> hey ,  do you guys think that if all those things happened ,  wed still hang out ?  opening credits the usual opening credits .  oh no !  these credits are based on the world that would have been created had all of the above actually happened .  it starts out with all of them at the fountain sitting on the couch as fat monica runs up and sits on the arm of the couch ,  tilting the whole thing towards her .  it then goes on to show rachels still a shop - aholic and with barry .  fat monica is sweating while cooking and dancing while eating a donut .  phoebe as the wall street shark smoking while on two cell phones .  then theyre dancing in the fountain .  joey entering as dr .  drake remoray and meeting a groupie .  chandler trying to write as a bird does its business on his shoulder and falling asleep while typing .  ross doing some kara - tay and trying to get carol into bed .  and finally ,  some more dancing in the fountain ,  them all flexing ,  and the turning out the lamp and shutting off all the lights bit from the first season .  just remember one thing ,  this is an alternate universe .  everything from every other episode doesnt apply ,  for instance ,  ross and rachel have no history .  and in fact have not seen each other in years in this world . }

<joey>  yeah ,  big brother .  
<monica> well thats a little crazy .  although i am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the internet .  
<chandler> yeah ,  well yknow ,  it just got me thinking though ,  why would anybody ever want to get married huh ?  
<monica> why ?  !  to celebrate your relationship !  to solidify your commitment !  to declare your love for one another to the world !  
<chandler> eh 
<monica> okay well thats good to know .

<monica> yknow youre really not supposed to be back here !  
<s> well yeah ,  im sorry .  i know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but i had to tell ya !  i wanna spend my life with you .  i wanna marry you .  i wanna have kids with you .

<s> you are ?

<phoebe> totally .  im like 90 / 10 .  
<rachel> yeah me too .   
<joey> hey uh ,  have you guys scene chandler ?  
<rachel>  whno ,  but yknow who did stop in here looking for ya ,  tennille .  
<chandler> sure i do .  in fact ,  i think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural .  i mean look at pigs .  lets take a second here and look at pigs .  okay pigs dont mate for life .  i mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime ,  and thats just an ordinary pig not even a pig thats good at sports !  
<monica> yeah ,  but thats pigs not people !  
<chandler> if marriage worked ,  id be all for it .  but do you know what the divorce rate in this country is ?  97% .  
<monica> wait a minute .  are you honestly telling me that - that you may never want to get married ?  
<chandler> well ,  never say never but yknow probably uh yeah ,  never .  
<monica> oh my god !  then - then - then what are we even doing ?  !  what is this ?  !  
<chandler> whoa !  whoa !  whoa !  what is all this pressure ?  !  is this some new kind of strategy ?  why dont you put down your copy of the rules huh mantrap ?  !  
<monica> yknow what ?  !  i gotta go !  ugh !   
<chandler>  its okay ,  i got a plan .  
<phoebe> definitely !  
<rachel> yeah ,  im pretty confident about that .  thats what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for monica and chandler !  it would be nice to have a little guarantee though .  
<phoebe> what do you mean ?  
<rachel> well yknow ,  some people make deals with a friend ,  like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40 ,  they marry each other .  
<phoebe> you mean a backup ?  
<rachel> exactly !  
<phoebe> yeah ,  yeah i got that .  
<rachel> you do ?  
<phoebe> hm - mmm .  
<rachel> who ?  
<phoebe> joey .

<rachel> wh so if neither of you are married by the time youre 40 ,  youre gonna marry joey .  
<phoebe> yep ,  we shook on it .  yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal .

<monica> is that some kind of boat talk ?  
<joey> i dont know !   i havent totally decided how to talk on my boat yet .  
<monica> what does he think ?  does he think im just gonna wait around for nothing ?

<s> we really do feel bad about this though .  
<s> we started saving again when you were dating richard and then that went to hell ,  so we redid the kitchen .  
<monica> what about when i started dating chandler ?  
<s> well it was chandler !  we didnt think hed ever propose !  
<chandler> clearly i did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal .   
<monica> i cant believe it !  that there is no money for my wedding ?  !  
<s> we might still have some money ,  if your father didnt think it was a good idea to sell ice over the internet .  
<s> it seemed like such a simple idea .  
<s> stupid jack ,  the word is stupid .  
<s> all right ,  enough !  i dont want to hear about it anymore !   good luck ,  chandler .

<ross> what ?  that &apos;s like insanely easy !  
<chandler> now ,  that &apos;s a lot harder than it sounds .  you always forget at least one ,  or in some cases .  .  .  fourteen  .  
<monica> it &apos;s a stupid game and i wasn &apos;t playing against other people ,  so technically i didn &apos;t lose .

<monica> now you think i wouldn &apos;t enjoy that ,  because it is so fake ,   but i still do .  
<phoebe> regular celery !   oh ,  i already have that .   
<ross> done !  with time - a to spare .  
<chandler> oooh that may be a new world &apos;s record  
<ross> you know ,  i hate to lecture you guys ,  but it &apos;s kinda disgraceful ,  that a group of well - educated adults and joey can &apos;t name all the states .  did you ever see a map ,  or one of those round ,  colorful things called  &quot; a globe ?  &quot;  hmm ?  
<chandler> uh ,  magellan ?  you got 46 states .

<ross> no ,  just give me another minute .  
<chandler> look ross ,  if you don &apos;t know them by now ,  you will never know them ,  okay ?  that is the beauty of this game .  it makes you want to kill yourself .  
<ross> this - this is crazy !  i can do this !  all right ,  uhh ,  i bet i can get all 50 before dinner .  
<chandler> okay ,  but if you can &apos;t no dinner !  
<ross> you &apos;re on !  
<joey>  all right .  don &apos;t look at my list ,  ross ,   &apos;cause there &apos;s a lot on there that you don &apos;t have .  
<monica>  hey ,  did you guys know that your oven doesn &apos;t work ?  
<joey> but the drawer full of take - out menus is okay ,  right ?

<chandler> which smells delicious !  
<monica> uh - oh !  uh - oh !

<chandler> extremely allergic ,  okay ?  if i &apos;m anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes ,  my throat will just close up !  
<phoebe> that &apos;s odd ,   &apos;cause this dog &apos;s been living here for the past 3 days 
<chandler>  really ?  
<monica> chandler ,  if that dog &apos;s been here that long ,  and you haven &apos;t had a reaction ,  maybe you &apos;re not allergic to this dog ?  
<chandler> well ,  it still has to go ,  right ?  
<chandler> okay ,  it &apos;s um 
<joey>  don &apos;t do it !  
<monica> don &apos;t do what ?  
<chandler>  i have to !  okay ?  it &apos;s time !   okay ,  i hate dogs .  
<s> what ?  
<phoebe> are you crazy ?  
<ross> are you out of your mind ?  
<phoebe> why ?  
<joey> told ya .   
<chandler> they are needy ,  they are jumpy ,  and you can &apos;t tell what they are thinking ,  and that scares me a little bit .  
<ross> right ,  they are scary .   ahh ,  she just ate a treat out of my hand !  !  !  
<rachel> wait a minute .  do you not like all dogs ?  i mean ,  not even puppies ?  
<chandler>  is there a puppy here ?  
<s> you don &apos;t like puppies ?  
<chandler>  okay ,  you are new !  
<joey> look ,  chandler ,  i told you ,  never tell anyone about this dog thing .  it &apos;s like ross not likin ice cream .  
<phoebe> you don &apos;t like ice cream ?  
<ross> it &apos;s too cold .  
<chandler> okay ,  it &apos;s just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable .  
<ross>  it hurts my teeth .  
<chandler> and i don &apos;t wanna say this ,  i don &apos;t want you guys to hate me ,  but uh ,  i don &apos;t think ,  i can be around that dog anymore .  okay ,  so either the dog goes ,  or i go .   oh my god !  !  
<ross> how can i not get this ?  i &apos;m a college professor; i got 1450 on my s . a . t . s .

<phoebe> all right .  we &apos;re gonna take clunkers to rosss .  we &apos;ll be back in a minute .   
<rachel> oh ,  wait before you guys go ,  can i just ask you a question ?  
<monica> yeah .  
<rachel> when a guy breaks up with his girlfriend ,  what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move ?  
<phoebe> oh ,  i &apos;d say about a month .  
<monica> really ?  i &apos;d say 3 to 4 .  
<joey> half hour .   
<rachel> interesting .  
<monica> when it &apos;s your assistant ,  i would say never .  
<joey> all right ,  rach ,  the big question is ,  does he like you ?  all right ?  because if he doesn &apos;t like you ,  this is all a moo - point .  
<rachel> huh .  a moo - point ?  
<joey> yeah ,  it &apos;s like a cow &apos;s opinion .  it just doesn &apos;t matter .  it &apos;s moo .  
<rachel>  have i been living with him for too long ,  or did that all just make sense ?  
<monica> please ,  don &apos;t listen to joey ,  okay .  would you look at him ?  he - hes obviously depressed .  he &apos;s away from his family; he &apos;s spending thanksgiving with strangers .  what he needs right now is for you to be his friend .  
<rachel> you &apos;re right ,  i &apos;m sorry .  thank you .  okay ,  that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do .  
<joey> fine !  take their advice .  no one ever listens to me .  when the package is this pretty ,  no one cares what &apos;s inside .

<rachel> now that she broke up with you ?  
<s> yeah .  
<rachel> yeah .  hmmmm .  
<s> it &apos;s weird .  i always used to assume ,  that i would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given .  but lately it &apos;s like what if it &apos;s not .  do you ever have that feeling ?  
<rachel> no yeah ,  all the time ,  constantly .  it &apos;s terrifying .  but you know that i figure it it has to work out .  
<s> why ?  
<rachel> because ,  uhit has to .

<s> wait - wait a minute; that doesn &apos;t make any sense .  
<rachel> no ?   all right ,  here &apos;s the truth um ,  joey said what he said ,  because um ,  i &apos;m attracted to you .  
<s> wow .   
<rachel> yeah ,  i admit it .  i have a crush on you ,  and uh ,  and ,  and i know that &apos;s crazy because we work together ,  and - and nothing could ever happen ,  and the last thing i want to do is - is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable .  which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now .  
<s>  oh my god !  those guys are stealing my car !

<phoebe> if you could do that ,  id marry the hippity - hop .  
<rachel> so ,  if i wanna have my kid when im 35 ,  i dont have to get pregnant until im 34 .  which gives prada four years to start making maternity clothes !  oh wait ,  but i do want to be married for a year before i get pregnant 
<monica> really !  that long ?  !   look all you want ,  its happening !  
<rachel> no ,  so i dont have to get married until im 33 !  thats three years ,  thats three whole yearsoh ,  wait a minute though .  ill need a year and a half to plan the wedding ,  and id like to know the guy for a year ,  year and a half before we get engaged which means i need to meet the guy by the time im thirty .

<joey> wow !  sure !  thats great !  
<joey> yeah !  yeah sure ,  just so long as its handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold .  its really important to the_director that everything in this movie is authentic .  yeah ,  and so in your love scene with sarah she talks about how shes never seen a naked man who wasnt jewish .  so  
<joey> so what ?  that part be authentically ,  anatomically not jewish .  do you know what im saying ?

<joey> i dont know !  i really want this part !  and they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes .  like if - if they want you to ride a horse ,  you tell em you can !  and just figure out how to do it later .  
<monica> joey !  this is not like learning to ride a horse !  this is like learning to grow a turtleneck !  
<joey> i kn - i know !  i know !  okay ?  and apparently tomorrow when i go in to meet the_director i have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like .

<joey> yeah ,  you got a couple hours ?  opening credits

<ross> no way !  
<rachel> well no brush !

<rachel>  alimony .   
<chandler> oh !  right .  umm ,  maybe thats because i didnt send him an invitation .  
<monica> chandler !  hes your father; he should be at the wedding .  
<chandler> i dont even know the man .  okay ?  were not that close .  i havent seen him in years .  
<monica> well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked ?  !  
<chandler> well he doesnt have to know !  its not like we run in the same circles .  i hang out with you guys ,  and he stars in a drag show in vegas .  
<phoebe> ooh ,  i think i wanna trade circles .  
<chandler> trust me ,  you dont want him there either .  okay ?  nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back - less dress .  
<monica> so what !  as long as hes not wearing a white dress and a veil i dont care .  
<phoebe> okay ,  i think i need to do some shopping .   
<rachel> my god !  
<ross> what do you think youre doing ?  !  
<rachel> just washing the windshield .   
<ross> there is no way i am letting you drive this car !  so why dont you just hand over the keys ?  
<rachel> oh .  of the steering wheel .  does anyone know why that is ?  its a tradition left over from porsches racing history .  the worlds greatest endurance race is the 24 hours of lemans .  which is in france and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on sunday .  in the 60s lemans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track .  at the start of the race ,  the drivers would run across the track ,  get in the car ,  buckle up ,  start the car ,  and drive off .  porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took .  since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel ,  that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat - belts ,  put the car in gear and start it .  the drivers left hand did nothing .  porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24 - hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat - belts with his right hand .  thats why every porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel . } 
<ross> no ah - ah - ah !  do not start this car !   okay !  okay !  i will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now !   
<rachel> look ross ,  if youre so freaked out ,  just get in the car !  
<ross> with you ?  !  yeah right !  
<rachel> all right .   
<ross>  okay !  okay !  okay !   
<rachel> what are you doing ?  !  get in the front !

<joey> pheebs !  check it out !  check it out !  check it out !  check it out !   
<phoebe> ooh ,  soap opera digest !

<s> i dont necessarily like to juice things 
<s> he said true or false !   
<joey> oh !  ooh - ooh !

<s>  ready ?  
<s> yeah .    
<s> and then it just builds on itself and theres no doing the scene after .  i mean you probably wait and really get it together and do it .  
<s> for me ,  i have a hard time with le blanc in particular .  when - wheni mean when 
<s>  you bastard .  
<s> yeah ,  what did i do ?  
<s> i keep a straight face he - he delivers like this look ,  a reaction to you ,  or a certain take ,  i - ii mean i find it so funny .

<ross> mornin   
<joey> i mean what kind of an actor ,  what kind of an actor cant even say ,   &quot; hmm ,  noodle soup ?  &quot;   
<s> thats a good one ?   
<s> now ,  we should go back and take the other line .

<s> action .  
<rachel> okay .  nowwhat is my first line ?  
<s>  what did we agree ?  
<s> okay  
<s> the good thing about the young kids though ,  theyre completely unpredictable .  which is a lot of fun as an actor to respond with .  but there was one story 
<s> oh little ben .  
<s> where the story was that i was anticipating that i would be around to hear my sons first words spoken .  but the scene was about that he wasnt supposed to be able to speak and ,  uh for some reason when we started doing the show  
<ross> hi !  were visiting !  
<rachel> yay !  
<ross> its ben and his da - da .  da - da ?  can you say da - da ?  yknow ,  you might as well say it because i told your

<s> da da .  
<ross> huh ?  
<s> da da .  
<s> yeah ,  hes saying da - da .   
<s> and then sometimes during the show yknow but youre like ,  the scenes going one way but youre just tempted to say something another time .  like ,  do you remember that one where monicas baking cookies in our old apartment ?  
<s> shes trying to intrigue us to hang out with her .  
<s> yeah ,  shes trying to waft the smell across the hall to get us to come hang out in her new place ,  and were sitting there eating pizza and i think it was you  that said

<phoebe> what do i smell ?  
<joey>  sorry .    
<s>  and then it was like four takes later before we could get through it with a straight face .   
<phoebe> what do i smell ?   
<s> le blanc .   
<phoebe> what do i smell ?  
<joey> i dont know ,  but it smells good .    
<s> but audiencesyou have a live studio audience and they must love that .  they must love it when they see you guys playing .   
<chandler> what are you guys doing ?

<joey> nothin .   
<s> so that you will intentionally do something thattheyll - theyll intentionally screw it up ?  
<s> yeah !  
<s> yeah !   
<s>  why ?  whats the matter ?    
<s>  you - youve worn a fat suit on the show .  and ,  a lot of people love you in the fat suit .  do you like wearing the fat suit ?  is it fun ?   
<s> im melting !   
<s> they made me dance ,  in the fat suit .    
<s> i - i heard some of you guys talking about this earlier ,  but sometimes theres just a word that someone has to say that youll get hung up on .  and itll justthe way you say the word is funny to everybody else .   
<ross> that tastes like feet !   
<s> it tastes like  feet !  
<s> okay ,  were good .

<monica> oh .   whats wrong ?  
<chandler> i drew my own bath ,  but i did it wrong !  the waters tepid .  the salt didnt dissolve and is now lodged places .  and the scents i used dont compliment each other .  eucalyptus and chamomileoh !  
<monica> what ?  
<chandler> the bath salts !  theyre starting to effervesce !  its different .   its interesting .  
<monica> okay ,  lets talk about something else .  
<chandler> yeah !  sure ,  sure .  so ,  what was going on with you today ?  oh - oh - oh !  
<monica> well ,  i actually had the weirdest conversation with joey .  he was talking about rules and right and wrong and 
<chandler> i had the exact same conversation .  
<monica> you did ?  what was he talking about ?  
<chandler> i dont know !  joey hasnt had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in macbeth !  
<monica>  that was a long night .  
<chandler> all right ,  lets break this down .  what exactly did he say to you ?  
<monica> okay ,  he was talking about rules .  
<chandler> uh - huh .  
<monica> umm ,  and looking at people differently .  
<chandler> he didnt say anything about that to me .  
<monica> what did he tell you ?  
<chandler> he was asking all these questions about you ,  me ,  and london .  and ,  of course the glue that holds this all together ,  the rules .  
<monica> okay .  so you ,  me and london .  looking at people differently .  maybe he wants to do what you and i did in london with someone .  
<chandler> but what did he mean by rules ?  
<monica> wait a minute !  he stopped talking the minute phoebe came in !  
<chandler> because he was looking at her differently .  
<monica> and phoebe is his friend ,  so he thinks that would be breaking the rules !  
<chandler> my god !  he wants to do it with phoebe in london !  
<phoebe>  you guys ?  
<monica> just a minute !   thats mrs .  tribbiani !  
<chandler> you dont say anything .  
<monica> why would i say anything ?  that two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives !  and they would have me to thank ,  and we could all start having babies ?  
<chandler> im not going to let you say anything .  
<monica> you just stay here !   
<chandler> oh ,  god !   
<phoebe> oh ,  hey ,  monica ,  i brought back your iron .  
<monica> oh ,  you had that ?  
<phoebe> uh - huh .  
<monica> i thought i lost it .  i got a new one ,  like ,  a month ago .  
<phoebe> oh ,  just as well ,  i broke this one .   
<phoebe> what ?  
<monica> nothing .  
<phoebe> okay .  
<monica> i mean ,  i - i ,  i really shouldnt say .  i mean ,  im really not supposed to .  
<phoebe> fine .  
<monica> its a humdinger !  
<phoebe> then its really too bad that you cant tell me .  
<monica> somebody likes you !  
<phoebe>  is it chandler ?  
<monica> no !  
<phoebe> well ,  then tell him to stop staring !  
<monica> its joey !  
<phoebe> really ?  !  joey ?  !  you dont say .  
<monica> is it something youd be interested in ?

<rachel> i didnt see anything !  i actually changed my mind about the name .  
<ross> i dont think so !  youre just giving me ruth so youll get to name it when its a boy ,  and thats when youll swoop in and name him heath or blaine or sequoia .  
<rachel> i wouldsequoia ?  
<ross> veto .  
<rachel> fine .  
<ross> unless  you anticipated that i would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl ,  and you really do want her to be named ruth !  well ,  im not falling for that !  okay ?  ruth is off the table !

<chandler> whoho ho .  .  .  listen to the judgement from the porn star !  
<monica> that tape was never meant to be seen by .  .  .   joey i would feel more comfortable if i was having this conversation in private .  
<joey>  monica ,  look .  .  .  i don &apos;t think you and i have any secrets anymore .  .  .   not ready to joke about it yet ,  okay ,  i see you later .   
<monica> why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it ?  
<chandler> because that &apos;s who i am ,  okay ?  i &apos;m sure a mature man like richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn &apos;t bother him .  just &apos;d be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men &apos;s club over brandy and moustaches .  
<monica> is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache ?  
<chandler> this is about you and richard .  he &apos;s clearly not over you .  he keeps a tape so he can .  .  .  look at it whenever he wants .  
<monica> isn &apos;t that sad ?  i mean ,  can you see how pathetic that is ?  you shouldn &apos;t be jealous .  you should feel bad for him .  
<chandler> oh ,  yeah ,  well ,  poor richard .  y &apos; .  .  .  i can grow a moustache !  
<monica> chandler ,  this is not our problem .  we &apos;ve got each other .  that &apos;s all that matters .  
<chandler> yeah ,  oh ,  but i just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air .  .  .  
<monica> cowboy boots ?  i &apos;ve never worn cowboy boots in my whole life !

<joey> oh .  .  . i don &apos;t know why this is so hard for me .  .  . y &apos;know what i mean ?  lying is basically just acting ,  and i am a terrific actor !  
<phoebe> you are a  terrific actor !

<ross> thank you amy !  
<s> no ,  no ,  then i would get the baby !  i mean you know ,  it &apos;d be just like a movie ,  like at first i wouldn &apos;t know what to do with her ,  then i would rise to the occasion ,  and then i get a make - over and then i get married ?  
<s> that &apos;s a great movie !   
<s> now listen ,  not that you guys could stop me or anything ,  cos you know ,  you &apos;d be dead .  but ,  i was thinking about changing her name .  .  . i &apos;m just not really a big fan of emily .

<s> i don &apos;t believe this .  hold on a second .  you guys die .  .  . and i don &apos;t get your baby ?  ?  ?  
<rachel> amy ,  see ,  we &apos;re alot closer to monica and chandler .  we see them everyday ,  and truthfully ,  honey ,  you don &apos;t seem very connected to the baby .  
<s> connected ?  i mean .  .  . to what ?  she &apos;s a lump !  
<chandler> you know guys ,  i gotta say this ,  this means so much to me .  that you &apos;d trust me ,  with your child .  .  . i mean ,  we all know that monica and i have been trying to have a baby of our own ,  and i &apos;ve had my doubts about my skills as a father ,  but .  .  . that you two .  .  .  . that you two .  .  .

<monica> ok .  .  . it &apos;s time for dinner !  erm .  .  . everyone ,  we &apos;re using our fancy china ,  and erm ,  it &apos;s very expensive .  .  . so pleaaase be careful .   
<ross> whoa .  .  .  .  . whoa .  .  .  .  .  .  whoa !  
<monica> ok er .  .  . just to be clear ,  comedy with the plates ,  will not be well - received .    
<joey> hey !  !  how come my plate is less fancy than everyone elses ?  do you not trust me with the fancy plate ?  
<monica> no !  !  !  honey that &apos;s .  .  . that &apos;s a special plate !  see ,  it &apos;s a game !  whoever gets that plate ,  wins !  
<s> y &apos;know ,  this is such a slap in the face .  i mean ,  i &apos;m your sister ,  and you &apos;d give your baby to these .  .  .  . strangers over me .  
<rachel> monica ,  is ross &apos; sister .  
<s> no .  .  .  . ross &apos; sister was really fat .  
<monica> that was me .  
<s> er .  .  . no .  she was this really dorky girl in high school ,  who used to follow rachel around like a puppy .  .  .  
<rachel> amy !  !  you &apos;ve got to stop doing that .   
<monica> ok .  .  . listen er .  .  . i know that you &apos;re having a little bit of a family crisis but you don &apos;t have to take it out on the plates !  in fact i think ,  that ,  everyone ,  should erm .  .  . cut their food like this !   now ,  see ?  this way you protect the plates ,  and let &apos;s face it .  you have fun .  
<s> ok ,  how bout this .  if you guys die ,  and the crazy plate lady dies .  .  . then do i get the baby .  
<chandler> no .  .  . if crazy plate lady .  .  .  if monica dies .  .  . then .  .  . i would get emma .  .  . right ?  
<rachel> well ,  actually .  .  .  .  
<chandler> actually what ?  
<ross> er .  .  . it &apos;s just that in that case .  .  . then erm .  .  . emma would go to my parents .  
<chandler> what ?  ?  !  
<s> hurts doesn &apos;t it ?   
<joey> er .  .  .  who has to die for me to get her ?   
<chandler> so ,  if monica &apos;s not around ,  i &apos;m not good enough to raise emma ?  
<ross> no ,  that &apos;s not what we are saying .  .  .  
<joey> yeah !  he &apos;s lying he looked down !   
<chandler> what .  .  . what is wrong with me ?  am i ,  am i incompetent ?  because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you !  
<rachel> honey ,  you &apos;re taking this the wrong way .  we think you &apos;re going to be a wonderful parent !  it &apos;s just that ,  you &apos;re more the .  .  . y &apos;know ,  fun parent .  
<ross> yeah !  and we wanna make sure that emma also has someone like monica ,  who &apos;s more of a disciplinarian .  .  . someone who can be firm ,  and strict .  
<monica> that &apos;s not how you see me is it ?  
<phoebe> no ,  you &apos;re all about the fun .   
<chandler> look ,  i may not know alot about babies ,  but you really think i &apos;m not capable ?  
<ross> no .  .  . you both are equally capable .  it &apos;s just that you &apos;re strongest ,  when you &apos;re together .  
<chandler> ok ,  so if we both had emma ,  and i die  she &apos;d have to give her up .  
<ross> sure !  monica would have to give her up .  
<joey> i lie better than that right ?   
<chandler> so .  .  . so let me get this straight .  so my two friends die ,  i get emma ,  then my wife dies ,  then emma the one - tiny - ray - of - hope left in my life ,  gets taken away from me ?  
<s> there &apos;s your movie !   
<chandler> oh ,  did somebody miss me ?  is there a child to raise poorly ?  
<monica> ross and rachel don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about !  i mean it &apos;s not like they &apos;re so responsible .  emma as a product of a bottle of murlo and a five - year - old condom .  
<chandler> y &apos;know but they &apos;re right .  i &apos;m not a strong father - figure and i never will be .  
<monica> no .  .  .  . you learn these things .  you grow into it .  
<chandler> yeah ,  but it &apos;s not who i am .  everything they said is exactly why i was worried about having a kid .  and it &apos;s true !  and ,  look ,  everybody knows it .  
<monica> i don &apos;t know it !  i want to have a kid with you because i think you &apos;re going to be an amazing dad .  at the fun parts and at the hard parts .  
<chandler> oh yeah ,  well ,  can you picture me saying ,   &quot; go to your room !  you &apos;re grounded !  &quot;  
<monica> can you hear me say you &apos;re grounded ?  
<chandler> you said that to me last week .  
<monica> how hard is it ?  no shoes on the furniture !   
<joey> argh .  the producer from days of our life left me a message on the machine asking why i wasn &apos;t at the parade !  they say everybody is very pissed off at me and they all got to meet santa !   
<phoebe> it &apos;s ok .  i thought of the perfect lie for you .  it &apos;s easy to remember and it doesn &apos;t invite alot of questions .  you weren &apos;t at the parade ,  because you had a family emergency .  
<joey> oh .  .  . i like that !  yeah !  i wasn &apos;t at the parade because i had a family emergency .  
<phoebe> ooo .  .  . what happened ?

<monica> wha .  .  . wait what are you doing ?  
<joey> setting the table .

<monica> oh .  . how nice !  maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress 
<ross> hey dude ,  you ok ?  sorry bout before .  
<chandler> no ,  no that &apos;s ok .  you &apos;re totally right i don &apos;t know anything about disciplining a child .  but .  .  . you did hurt my feelings .  .  . so ,  i want you to know that if i die ,  you don &apos;t get joey .

<ross> you know what ?  i don &apos;t need a tie .  i mean ,  it &apos;s better ,  open collar .  you know ,  it &apos;s more casual  
<joey> oh ,  sometimes we use the same extras for different parts .  it &apos;s okay .  
<phoebe> well ,  it &apos;s not okay ,  because i gave a very memorable performance as the nurse .  and now suddenly i &apos;m the_waitress ?  that &apos;s gonna confuse my fans .  
<joey> maybe you are a nurse ,  but you moonlight as a waitress .  
<phoebe> uhuh .  because i &apos;m a single mother ,  supporting my two children .  
<joey> nice .

<s> you can do the presentation .  
<rachel> no ,  i can &apos;t ,  i have a baby .  
<s> i &apos;ll watch her .

<joey> hey ,  listen pheebs .  i was just talking to the_director ,  and he was thinking ,  maybe this time you don &apos;t hit drake ,  you just wait on the tables ?  
<phoebe> i can &apos;t do that .  i &apos;m an actor .  i have a process .  
<joey> you &apos;re a masseuse .  you have a table with a hole in it .  
<phoebe> wait a minute ,  i see what &apos;s happening here .  you &apos;re threatened .  
<joey> what ?  
<phoebe> yeah ,  i &apos;m so good in this scene that i &apos;m stealing focus from you .  well ,  rise to the challenge tribianni  &apos;cause i just raised the bar .  come join me up here !  
<joey>  yeah ,  you can fire her ,  but i would call security ,  she won &apos;t go easy .  
<chandler> oh yes you can .  you just make the faces and the noises .  
<monica> guys can fake it ?  unbelievable .  the one thing that &apos;s ours !  besides ,  why would you fake it when we &apos;re trying to have a baby ?  
<chandler> that &apos;s actually why .  look ,  i &apos;m starting a whole new career now ,  and i &apos;m not saying that i don &apos;t want to have a baby ,  i &apos;m just saying maybe we could wait a little while .  
<monica> like a month ?  
<chandler> or a year ?  
<monica> really ,  you want to wait a year ?  
<chandler> it could be less than a year .  i mean ,  you &apos;ve heard my stuff .   &quot; pants .  like shorts ,  but longer .  &quot;   it &apos;ll probably be more than a year .  
<monica> i really wanna have a baby .  
<chandler> yeah ,  me too .  look ,  i &apos;ll just get my old job back .  
<monica> no ,  i want you to have a job that you love .  not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration .  
<chandler> i quit and you learn what i do ?  
<monica> it &apos;s just ,  i think ,  there &apos;s never gonna be a right time to have a baby .  i mean ,  now you &apos;re unemployed and in a little while you &apos;ll find a new job that &apos;ll keep you really busy .  there &apos;s always gonna be a reason not to do this ,  but i think once the baby comes ,  forget about all those reasons .  
<chandler> i guess .  it &apos;s always gonna be scary when we have a baby .  
<monica> it &apos;s gonna be really scary .  i mean ,  god .  when we have a baby ,  there &apos;s gonna be so much that we &apos;re not able to control .  i mean ,  the apartment &apos;s gonna be a mess ,  i won &apos;t have time to clean it .  what if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer ?  messes up all the ribbons ?  !  what if there &apos;s no room for a ribbon drawer ,  because the baby &apos;s stuff takes up all the space !  ?  where will all the ribbons go !  ?  !  
<chandler> should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind ?  
<monica> yes ,  please !  
<chandler> oh ,  and i promise ,  i will not fake it this time .  
<monica> i wish i could say the same .  i &apos;m a little shook up !  closing credits

<rachel> oh yeah ,  i &apos;m jealous .   &quot; oh gavin ,  please ,  please look at my ass &quot;  .   stop looking at my ass !  i mean ,  i just think you are totally inappropriate ,  ok ?  this is a work environment ,  she &apos;s your subordinate .  
<s> i thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant tag .  
<rachel> that is totally different for two reasons .  one  -  i didn &apos;t know that you knew that .  and two ,  i wasn &apos;t some creep staring at his ass ,  we had a deap meaningful relationship .  
<s> huh .  what &apos;s tag &apos;s last name ?  
<rachel> it was  .  .  .   oh my god .  he didn &apos;t have a last name .  it was just  &quot; tag &quot;  .  you know ,  like cher ,  or ,  you know ,  moses .  
<s> but it was a deap meaningful relationship .  
<rachel> oh ,  you know what  -  my first impression of you was absolutely right .  you are arrogant ,  you are pompous  .  .  .  morgan !  morgan !  tag &apos;s last name was morgan !  huh !

<monica> would you stop staring at her ?  
<chandler> i wasn &apos;t staring .  i was leering .  
<monica> what &apos;s the big deal with her ?  maybe she &apos;s attractive in an obvious kind of way .  
<ross> yeah ,  obvious beauty &apos;s the worst .  you know ,  when it &apos;s right there in your face .  me ,  i like to have to work to find someone attractive .  makes me feel like i earned it .  
<chandler> looks like joey is doing allright with her .  
<monica> yeah .  hey ,  that was nice of you guys to back off and let joey get the girl for once .  
<s>  i &apos;m gonna take her back to the appartment .

<s> i think it &apos;s sweet .   
<rachel>  hey ,  listen ,  joey ,  about molly ,  i really prefer if you didn &apos;t go after her .  
<joey> why not ?  
<rachel> because it took us months to find a good nanny and i wouldn &apos;t want anything to ,  you know ,  drive her away .  
<joey> so ,  what ,  you think i &apos;m just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable ?   yeah ,  sounds about right .  
<ross> come on ,  there are plenty of other women out thereok ?  just  -  just forget about her ,  ok ?  just ,  she &apos;s off limits .  
<joey> oh ,  man ,  why did have to go and say that for ?  now that you told me i can &apos;t have it makes me want her even more !  
<ross> what are you ,  a child ?  
<joey> yes !  
<ross> joey ,  come on now ,  for me !  please ,  just - just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else .  
<joey> fine .   
<monica>  take me home !   
<s> hey p 
<phoebe> what are you doing ?  
<s> setting rat traps .

<s> no ,  no ,  to test his neck strength .  
<phoebe> no ,  mike ,  i don &apos;t want to kill him !  i thought we were just gonna capture him and ,  and you know ,  set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl .  
<s> ok ,  ok ,  i &apos;ll throw away the traps .  
<phoebe> i &apos;ll find bob ,  i &apos;ll get him .  bob ?   bob !  robert !   oh wait ,  i think i hear him .  oh  -  oh my god !  bob had babies !  bob &apos;s a mom !

<phoebe> suzie ?   
<chandler> seriously dude ,  3 years ago .  
<ross> listen ,  can you do me a favor ?  i &apos;m gonna be out today .  can you just keep an eye on joey ,  make sure nothing happens between him and molly ?  
<chandler> you don &apos;t trust him ?  
<ross> wh  -  no .  some woman who sounded a lot like joey called earlier and asked for her daughter ,  the  &quot; hot nanny &quot;  .  
<chandler> is this really your long term plan ,  for me to run interference ?  because i could get a job any day now .  
<ross> you do appear right on the cusp of something .  come on man ,  i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll lose interest in a week or two ,  but for now can you please just do this for me ?  
<chandler> allright ,  fine ,  but don &apos;t blame me if it doesn &apos;t work .  because you know as well as i do that once joey sets his mind on something ,  more often than not ,  he &apos;s going to have sex with it .  
<ross> well we gotta do something ,  ok ?  nannies like her don &apos;t grow on trees .   
<chandler> picturing that tree ?  
<ross> i am ,  yes .

<chandler> your thoughts ?  plural ?  
<joey> allright ,  fine ,  i only have one thought !  it &apos;s about the hot nanny ,  i gotta see her !

<joey> now you &apos;re telling me i can &apos;t see her ?  ?  you guys are killing me !  she &apos;s forbidden fruit !  it &apos;s like  .  .  .  like she &apos;s the princess and i &apos;m the stable boy  .  .  .  why are you doing this ,  huh ?  did ross tell you not to let me go over there ?  
<chandler> yes ,  as a matter of fact he did ,  so i can &apos;t let you go .  
<joey> huh .  interesting .  now there are obstacles .  hot nanny and me against the world .  this is the kind of stuff great novels are made of .

<rachel> are you comparing my daughter to a rat ?  
<phoebe> no !  seven rats !  i think we should take them home ,  we need feed them .  
<rachel> whhh wait ,  you &apos;re gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats ?  
<phoebe> well i &apos;m sorry rachel ,  but i &apos;m not like you ,  ok ?  not everyone can afford help .

<s> hey ,  when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve around their rats ?  
<phoebe> well ,  you know what ,  they &apos;re our responsibility now .  
<s> ok ,  fine ,  these rats are our responsibility .  what happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them ?  
<phoebe> mate ?  they &apos;re all brothers and sisters .

<phoebe> no .   wh  -  get off your sister !  oh my god ,  what are we gonna do ?  we have 7 rats .  so what if each of them has 7 rats ?  and then each of those have 7 rats ?  that &apos;s like  .  .  .   that &apos;s math i can &apos;t even do !  what are we gonna do ?  
<s> well ,  i know this is gonna sound crazy ,  but ,  we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives .  
<phoebe> yeah ,  ok .  i guess you &apos;re right .  allright ,  so we should just give them away .  but to nice families ,  with children ,  and reduced fat wheat thins .  they &apos;re bob &apos;s favorites .  
<s> it &apos;s gonna be ok .  
<phoebe> you must think i &apos;m crazy .  
<s> no ,  i think you &apos;re sweet .  
<phoebe> good .  it &apos;s just so hard ,  it &apos;s hard for me to  .  .  .  let them go .  i guess it just brings back memories ,  you know ,  from  .  .  .  when i gave birth to my brother &apos;s triplets and i had to give them up .   i haven &apos;t told you about that yet ,  have i ?  
<rachel> hi .  thanks for the party ,  honey .  should i help you clean up ?

<rachel> see ,  gavin ,  you &apos;re capable of being a nice guy .  why did you give me such a hard time ?  
<s> i &apos;m not sure .  
<rachel> well monica seems to think it &apos;s because you have feelings for me .  
<s> i do have feelings for you .  
<rachel> you do ?  
<s> yes ,  i feel that you are a little annoying .  
<rachel> see ?  why ,  gavin ,  why ?  right when i &apos;m about to change my opinion of you ,  you go and you  .  .  .   and you do that  .  .  .    ending credits 
<chandler>  first i was afraid ,  i was petrified

<chandler> sure !  just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you !  do you believe that who ever did something over here last night did what they did or didn &apos;t do  .  .  . i mean come on !  !  
<ross> ok you .  .  . you really don &apos;t know what i am talking about ?  
<chandler> no !  
<ross> ok !  last night after the party i saw rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony .  
<chandler> our balcony ?  seriously ?  that &apos;s so funny because i told monica we should put lights on our balcony .  and she said  &quot; no ,  no .  it &apos;s too cold ,  nobody will go out there .  &quot;  and i said  &quot; maybe if we put some light out there they will &quot;  
<ross> right that &apos;s why i came over to talk about .  hum .  .  . i saw rachel kissing some guy on your balcony ,  even though there were no lights  !  
<chandler> so are you gonna .  .  . talk to her ?  
<ross> why .  .  . why should i ?  i mean if she wants to move on ,  that &apos;s fine !  
<chandler> you know when  &quot; that &apos;s fine &quot;  sounds true when someone yells it and spits !  
<ross> no i &apos;m serious .  i mean she wants to date people ?  fine !  i don &apos;t care but .  .  . at least she could have told me .  you know i .  .  . i &apos;ve been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys she barely knows ,  then so will i  !  very funny !  ross is gay !  ah !  ah !  
<chandler> no no no .  good .  so you &apos;re moving on ?  do you have any idea where you &apos;re moving ?  
<ross> i don &apos;t know .  i mean i have plenty of opportunity .  just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me .  and then the other day on the subway a woman  &quot; accidentally &quot;  sat on my hand .  
<chandler> dude ,  don &apos;t rub my face in your crazy single life !  
<ross> well ,  and how about this ?  there is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter - departmental potluck dinner .  
<chandler> why did i get married ?  !   
<phoebe> well it depends .  
<joey> on .  .  .  ?  
<phoebe> on how far along he &apos;s in the sex change process !  
<monica> no i totally disagree .  no i think it &apos;s fine for a guy to do something like that .  such you an actor .  not that you need to ,  your eyebrows are .  .  .  
<joey> ok !  stop it you guys !  stop staring !  you &apos;re freaking me out !

<phoebe> oh before i forget ,  are you coming to mike &apos;s piano bar tonight ?  
<monica> only if i don &apos;t have to get up and sing .  
<phoebe> but everybody sings .  it &apos;s so much fun !  last time this adorable old man got out there ,  forgot all of the words ,  flipped out and everyone booed him off the stage .  so funny .  
<monica> it &apos;s just ,  i &apos;m not good at singing .  
<phoebe> oh !  what &apos;s the matter ?  are you scared ?  you &apos;re afraid i &apos;m a better singer ?  you &apos;re afraid i &apos;m gonna beat you at singing ?  
<monica> no no ,  it &apos;s not working on me .  wow !  i must be growing up !  
<phoebe> ok fine !  please come and support mike .  you don &apos;t have to sing .  
<monica> so i don &apos;t have to sing and i can just sit there and pass judgments on others ?  
<phoebe> while drinking .  .  .  
<monica> i &apos;m there !  
<rachel> hi guys !  listen i really need your help .  i think i did something really stupid .  
<phoebe> well yes rachel but you got something so beautiful out there 
<rachel> no not that .  i kissed gavin last night .  
<phoebe> oh my god .  
<monica> you kissed him ?  
<rachel> yeah .  it was after the party ,  we were on the balcony and .  .  .  
<monica> wait wait wait .  i was at home the whole time .  how did i missed that ?  
<phoebe> it was the end of the party ,  you were probably ironing wrapping paper .  
<monica> oh yeah .  .  . so how did you end up kissing ?  
<rachel> you know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and ,  oh and he gave me this scarf .  .  .  
<monica> i thought you hated him ?  
<rachel> you know honey ,  there is a thin line between love and hate ,  and it turns out that line .  .  . is a scarf !  
<monica> so are you thinking of starting up something with this guy ?  
<rachel> i don &apos;t know .  it &apos;s so complicated .  i work with this guy ,  you know ,  i have the baby ,  and i have ross ,  and i just .  .  . i don &apos;t know what to do and i have to be at the office and see gavin in ten minutes .  
<monica> sounds like you need to think about what you want ,  talk to gavin ,  and you definitely should talk to ross 
<rachel> or .  .  . i could call in sick and not deal with it at all .  .  .  
<phoebe> wow !  five - month maternity leave ,  you &apos;re back for four days ,  kiss a co - worker ,  call in sick ,  they are lucky to have you !  !  
<joey> chandler bing .  will be right with you .

<ross> not well .  i went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants .  
<chandler> well maybe you &apos;re going about this the wrong way .  you know i mean think about it .  single white male ,  divorced three times ,  two illegitimate children .  the personal ad writes itself .  .  .  .  
<ross> that &apos;s funny .  .  . do you think you &apos;ll ever work again ?  
<chandler> what are doing ?  you know i can only dish it out !  
<ross> i can &apos;t believe rachel just moved on and didn &apos;t say anything to me 
<chandler> maybe she didn &apos;t move on ,  you know .  .  . maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one - time birthday thing 
<ross> no no ,  about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar .  
<chandler> did she go out with him ?  
<ross> no .  when he called ,  i .  .  . i threw the message away .  
<chandler> ah !  the high road .  .  .  
<ross> you know what ?  enough !  enough talking !  i have to get moving !  hey check out those two blondes over there !  hey come with me !  
<chandler> are you trying to get everybody divorced ?  
<ross> you don &apos;t have to do anything .  it will just be easier if it is the two of us ,  like college ,  remember ?  you .  .  . you break the ice with some kind of jokes so that they know you &apos;re the funny one and i swoop in with some interesting conversation ,  so they &apos;ll see that i &apos;m the brilliant ,  brooding ,  sexy one .  .  .  
<chandler> i thought i had to make the jokes !

<ross> i told you it wasnt long ,  but there is an amazing connection between us .  
<s> you feel that too ?  oh ,  i thought that was just me !  
<ross> are you kidding ?  
<s> hey ,  do you want to go away this weekend ?  
<ross> well see .  
<rachel> ok ,  ross ,  whats going on here ,  are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now ?  
<ross> i dont know ,  are we just kissing guys on balconies ?  
<rachel> how do you know about that ?  
<ross> through the magic of sight !  i was here ,  putting our child to sleep .  .  .  
<s> emma .  
<ross> when i happened to look through the window and i see you kissing a guy you know ,  for what ?  a week ?  
<rachel> oh ,  thats what this is all about ?  did you bring her up here to get back at me ?  
<s> no ,  actually ,  see i had to pee ,  cause i cant use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites .

<ross> you know ,  if its meant to be ,  ill guess it .  bye ,  bye .  
<rachel> score .  
<ross> oh ,  i am sorry ,  did you not like her ,  because i was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on the balcony .  
<rachel> oh god ,  i cant believe youre making such a big deal about this .  it was one kiss ,  one guy ,  one time !  
<ross> oh ,  really !  
<rachel> yeah .  
<ross> oh ,  really !  
<rachel> oh yeah .  
<ross> what about the guy from the bar ?  
<rachel> what ?  who ?  
<ross> the guy you gave your number to .  
<rachel> whoa ,  how do you know about that ?  
<ross> because he called here looking for you .  so dont tell me this .  .  . this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing ,  ok ?  youve been out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now .  and you didnt even have the courtesy to tell me .  
<rachel> why didnt i get that message ?  
<ross> what ?  
<rachel> from the guy in the bar ,  why didnt i get that message ?  
<ross> because i folded it up and put in my pants pocket .  do you .  .  . do you not look there ?  
<rachel> ross ?  
<ross> i never gave it to you .  
<rachel> why ?  
<ross> i dont know .  
<rachel> oh god .  you know what ?  who you think you are ?  who are you to decide what messages i should or should not get ?  
<ross> who am i ?  
<rachel> yes .  
<ross> i am the guy whos taking care of our baby while youre out at bars meeting guys !  
<rachel> oh my god ,  i cannot believe this .  you know i actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you about us !  but i cant do that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my apartment !  
<ross> none of the sane ones wanted to come back with me !  thats not the point .  ok ?  the point is you .  .  . you are the one who moved on and didnt tell anyone !  
<rachel> oh ,  ross ,  this is just so messed up !  whats wrong with us ?  you know when people hear about our situation they always ask ,  what ,  you live together but youre not a couple ?  and you have a baby ,  isnt that weird ?  and i say no .  you know what ,  its not ,  because it works for us !  but you know this doesnt work .  in fact this is the opposite of working !  
<ross> uh ,  clearly .  
<rachel> and you know ,  we said that we would ,  we would live together as long as this makes sense .  an maybe this ,  you know ,  just doesnt make sense anymore .  
<ross> yeah ,  maybe not .  so what you wanna do ?  
<rachel> hi .  can emma and i live here for a while ?  
<joey> ha ,  oh ,  of course .  
<rachel> thank you .  
<joey> your eyebrows look weird .

<rachel> hey !  you remembered to put clothes on this morning .  
<joey> fifth day &apos;s a charm .  
<rachel> oh ,  joey ,  it &apos;s so great to be back here .  i gotta tell you ,  you &apos;re making it so easy on me and emma .  
<joey> hey ,  it &apos;s great having you back .  you know ,  stay as long as you want ,  and when does she stop crying all night ?   
<ross> hey ,  you &apos;re not naked !  so hey ,  rach ,  when will we expect to see you tonight ?  
<rachel> well ,  i &apos;ll probably be back to pick her up around six ,  but she &apos;s in the bedroom all ready to go .  but she did actually fall back to sleep ,  so .  .  .  
<joey> she &apos;s probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night .  
<rachel> bye !   
<ross> bye !  hey ,  i hope emma isn &apos;t making it too hard on you .  
<joey> no ,  hey ,  it &apos;s been great .  
<ross> yeah ?  
<joey> yeah .  and look ,  i just want you to know that with rachel staying here and everything ,  all my feelings from before are totally over ,  okay ?  and even if they weren &apos;t ,  when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump .  .  .  
<ross> yeah ,  that &apos;ll do it .  
<joey> wow !  so ,  how are you ?  
<ross> i &apos;m ,  i &apos;m okay .  
<joey> really ?  
<ross> sure ,  i mean ,  do i wish me and rachel living together would have worked out ?  of course .  you know ,  i &apos;m disappointed ,  but it &apos;s not like it &apos;s a divorce .  
<joey> well ,  actually it .  .  .  
<ross> no ,  it &apos;s not a divorce ,  it is not a divorce !  anyway ,  i think rachel and i need to ,  you know ,  get on with our lives ,  maybe ,  maybe start seeing other people .  
<joey> wow ,  really ?  
<ross> yeah ,  sure ,  why not ?  in fact ,  if you know anyone that would be good for me .  .  .  
<joey> sure ,  i know lots of girls .  
<ross> yeah ?  any names come to mind ?  
<joey> ooh ,  names ?  opening credits .  
<joey> hey .  i was just gonna get something to eat .  you want something ?  
<phoebe> what you got ?  joey see ,  we got strained peas ,  strained carrots .  .  .  ooh !  strained plums .  we haven &apos;t tried that yet .  
<phoebe> goodie !  thanks .  so ,  how is it living with rachel again ?  i mean ,  apart from the great food .  
<joey> i &apos;m fine ,  i &apos;m fine ,  it &apos;s just ,  it &apos;s just weird what &apos;s happening with her and ross .  you know ,  yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody .  
<phoebe> oh my god ,  rachel asked me if i knew anyone for her too .  
<joey> why are they doing this ?  
<phoebe> i don &apos;t know .  they &apos;re so perfect for each other; it &apos;s crazy .  
<joey> you know what &apos;s crazy ?  these jars .  what is it ,  like two bites in here ?  
<phoebe> i just wish they &apos;d realise they should be together .  
<joey> i know ,  i know .  and when they moved back in together ,  i figured y &apos;know ,  that &apos;s where things were headed .  
<phoebe> i know .  they should be a family .  they should get married and have more children .  
<joey> yes ,  and they should name one of their kids joey .  i may not have kids; someone &apos;s gotta carry on the family name .  
<phoebe> you know what ?  maybe once they start dating ,  and they see what &apos;s out there ,  they &apos;ll realise how good they are for each other .  
<joey> yeah ,  because it is slim pickings .  still in the bedroom .  
<phoebe> so ,  what are we gonna do ?  are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people ?  
<joey> i know; that just pushes them further and further apart .  
<phoebe> yeah .   oh ,  i know what we can do .  we could set ross and rachel up on horrible dates ,  so that they &apos;ll realise how good they are together .  
<joey> ooh ,  that &apos;s a great plan !  
<phoebe> yeah ,  you know what the best part of it is ?  i get to do my  &quot; plan - laugh .  &quot;    
<joey> shhh !  not so loud ,  we don &apos;t wanna wake up ,  uh .  .  .   
<monica> hey !  
<rachel> you guys aren &apos;t doing anything tonight ,  are you ?  
<chandler> see ,  now ,  why would you assume that ?  just because we &apos;re married ?  i will have you know that we are very hip ,  happening people .  now ,  if you &apos;ll excuse me ,  i have to get back to reading the obituaries .  
<rachel> i was just asking  &apos;cause i need someone to watch emma tonight .  
<monica> sure ,  we &apos;ll do that .  what are you up to ?  
<rachel> well ,  phoebe set me up on a date .

<monica> oh ,  it &apos;s perfect .  
<rachel> oh ,  you guys are gonna have so much fun !  she &apos;s at such a cute age .  oh ,  a couple things .  now that she &apos;s eating solid food ,  she poops around the clock .  and watch out for your hair ,   &apos;cause she likes to grab it .  and oh ,  she &apos;s also in this phase where if you leave the room ,  she screams bloody murder ,  but ah .  .  .  thanks ,  you guys .  have fun !  i wish i was reading my own name .  
<joey> hey .

<phoebe> so now what do we do ?  
<joey> well ,  okay ,  i &apos;ll  -  i &apos;ll just call her and tell her the date &apos;s cancelled ,  and find him somebody else .  
<phoebe> what if we don &apos;t find him somebody else ?  we &apos;ll just tell her the date &apos;s off ,  but we don &apos;t tell ross ,  and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up !  
<joey> ooh .  .  . i hear that &apos;s bad .  
<phoebe> ooh ,  so this is great !  rachel &apos;s gonna have a terrible date ,  ross gets stood up ,  and then they &apos;ll realise how good they have it together .  
<joey> ah ,  yes ,  the plan !   
<phoebe> it &apos;s not santa &apos;s plan .  no ,  it &apos;s .  .  .

<chandler> it &apos;s okay .  go take the test and see if we &apos;re okay .  
<monica> okay .   
<chandler> tough crib .  
<monica> hey ,  where are all my ovulation - sticks ?  there &apos;s only one here .

<s> uh ,  there &apos;s a drunk chinese guy .

<monica> canoodling ?  
<chandler> well ,  i can &apos;t say  &quot; hump &quot;  or  &quot; screw &quot;  in front of the b - a - b - y .  
<monica> i don &apos;t know .  i mean ,  i guess having sex in front of a baby isn &apos;t so .  .  .  
<chandler> horrifying ?  scarring ?  something people go to jail for ?  
<monica> i guess you &apos;re right .  
<chandler> you guess i &apos;m right ?  when we stayed at that bed and breakfast ,  you wouldn &apos;t have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window .  
<monica> but what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer ?  
<rachel> oh ,  well ,  that &apos;s  -  that &apos;s very sweet .  thank you .

<s> i &apos;m not funny either .  so ,  if you were thinking ,   &quot; well ,  he &apos;s not that good - looking ,  but maybe we &apos;ll have some laughs &quot;  .  .  .  that ain &apos;t gonna happen .  
<rachel> well ,  come on ,  steve; let &apos;s not rule out nervous laughter .  hey ,  now wait a minute .  phoebe told me that  -  that you owned your own restaurant .  that &apos;s impressive .  
<s> i lost it .  to drugs .   
<s> i silk - screen t - shirts now .  
<rachel> really ?  what &apos;s that like ?  
<s> it &apos;s really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money .  that &apos;s right .  i have no money ,  i &apos;m not funny ,  i live in a studio apartment with two other guys ,  and i &apos;m pretty sure i &apos;m infertile .  rachel on ,  steve .  there must be something that you like about yourself .

<ross> this is unbelievable .  i  -  i have never been so insulted in my life .  now ,  if you &apos;ll wrap up my free crab cakes ,  i &apos;ll be on my way .

<chandler> all right ,  all right ,  we were .  we were trying to make a baby .  monica &apos;s ovulating .

<rachel> eww !  
<ross> well ,  what happened ?  
<rachel> oh ,  well ,  i .  .  . it &apos;s kind of weird talking to you about this ,  but .  .  .  
<ross> monica told me you had a blind date .  
<rachel> yeah .  
<ross> i did ,  too .  
<rachel> oh .  
<ross> but is it technically a date if the other person doesn &apos;t show up ?  
<rachel> oh ,  oh no .  do you think she walked in ,  saw you and left ?  
<ross> why does everyone keep saying that ?  
<rachel> well ,  if it makes you feel any better ,  i wish my date hadn &apos;t shown up .  
<ross> that bad ?  
<rachel> well ,  he makes t - shirts for a living ,  and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this .   
<ross> female body inspector ?  what size is that ?   
<phoebe> now ,  wait a minute .  so ,  they &apos;re gonna name their first child joey ?  
<joey> uh - huh .  
<phoebe> how  -  how do i get them to name the next one after me ?  
<joey> it &apos;s easy ,  you just walk in on them having sex .  
<phoebe> oh ,  so they owe me like ,  three phoebes .   
<phoebe> oh my god !  look ,  it &apos;s ross and rachel .  oh ,  the plan is working .   
<phoebe> don &apos;t ,  don &apos;t do the plan - laugh .   
<ross> the first date we &apos;ve had in months ,  and they were both such disasters .

<joey> wooooooooow  it &apos;s like they &apos;re on fire !  
<monica> what are they ?

<chandler> what am i supposed to do with these ?  
<monica> ah ,  come on ,  sneakers are easy .  you wear sneakers all the time .  
<chandler> well ,  first of all ,  they &apos;re not called  &quot; sneakers &quot;  anymore .  apparently ,  they &apos;re called  &quot; kicks &quot;  or  &quot; skids &quot;  and i think i heard somebody say  &quot; slorps &quot;  .   roll around  &apos;cause ,  apparently ,  walking is too much exercise .  kids ,  kids ,  roll your way to childhood obesity !   would you help me try to sell these ?  
<monica> okay ,  have you considered using a girl with huge knockers ?  
<chandler> no ,  i don &apos;t think that &apos;s the kinda thing they &apos;re looking for .

<ross> hey ,  you &apos;ll never guess what just happened phoebe and i got mugged !

<ross> i see .  you didn &apos;t happen to tell 
<monica> owen 
<monica> i know .  .  . god .  i haven &apos;t seen my savings take a hit like this since i was a kid and they came up with double - stuffed oreos .  what happened to all our money ?  
<chandler> i &apos;m not sure what they did ,  but i &apos;m inclined to blame enron .  
<monica> i guess with you doing the internship ,  we &apos;re just spending more than we &apos;re bringing in .  
<chandler> maybe i should quit and get a job that pays .  
<monica> oh ,  but you &apos;re finally doing something that you love !  i can &apos;t ask you to give that up .  though it &apos;d be nice if the thing that you love was y &apos;know .  .  .  finding gold .  
<chandler> you know what ?  you know what ?  i think we &apos;re making too big a deal out of this .  ok ?  so we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things .  and maybe we start eating out of joey &apos;s refrigerator for a change .  you &apos;re chef .  .  .  what can you make out of backing soda and beer ?  
<monica> ok worse case scenario is .  .  . we borrow some money from my parents .  
<chandler> no !  we &apos;re not borrowing money .  
<monica> why not ?  
<chandler> because we don &apos;t do that .  we are bings !  and if there &apos;s one thing my father taught me was .  .  .  well to always knock before going into the pool house .  .  .  but the other thing was never borrow money .  
<monica> wow !  i had no idea you had this much pride .  
<chandler> that &apos;s right !  i do !  and i &apos;m your man .  and i &apos;m going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard .  opening credits

<joey> well it &apos;s .  .  . it &apos;s not that crazy okay ?  making them smaller ,  that would be crazy .  
<phoebe> oh !  alright .  well i think the reason people laugh is becuase it &apos;s a play on the word roomy .  
<s> i get the joke .  sophisticated as it was .  now the thing i wanna say is .  .  .  maybe we should have talked about this before .  us living together ,  you &apos;re not expecting a proposal ,  right ?

<phoebe> was it really that bad ?  
<s> at one point near the end she deliberately defecated .  .  .  .  .  
<phoebe> ok ,  well that &apos;s bad .  but don &apos;t you think it might be different with someone else ?  perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet .  except for once in the ocean .  
<s> look it &apos;s not about who i would marry .  and i was certain the first time i got married it would last forever .  and i was totally wrong !  
<phoebe> but it &apos;s just .  .  .  
<s> look phoebe ,  it &apos;s not about you .  i just never wanna get married again .

<s> oh !  sorry ,  i guess i was thrown off by the mention of my name !  
<monica> look ,  guys ,  you can &apos;t do this ,  it &apos;s just going to make getting over each other ,  that much harder .  
<phoebe> not if nothing happens .  why can &apos;t .  .  .  why can &apos;t we just hang out as friends ?  
<monica> sure !  if you &apos;re just gonna hang out as friends ,  then maybe i &apos;ll join ya .  you know ,  i &apos;m your friend  and mike &apos;s friend  .

<monica> you know ,  on the way over here ,  i saw this drunk guy throw up .  and then a pigeon ate it !  
<ross> uhu uhu ,  check this out .   
<chandler> huh !  so that &apos;s what i would look like if i worked out .  .  .  and was being serviced by a policeman .  you &apos;re not actually going to send these out are ya ?  
<ross> eh .  . actually no ,  i don &apos;t need to because your little  &quot; ross is dead &quot;  joke didn &apos;t work ,  ok ,  there were no responses .  nobody posted anything on the website ,  nobody called my parents ,  so the joke my friend is on you .  nobody called ,  nobody wrote anything ,  nobody cares that i &apos;m dead .   oh my god !  nobody cares that i &apos;m dead !  ?  
<chandler> no ,  come on ,  you know that &apos;s not true .  
<ross> what are you talking about ?  you get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet !  i didn &apos;t get one response !  and i &apos;m dead !  
<chandler> well ,  the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community .  
<ross> i can &apos;t believe this .  not even my geology lab partner ?  and i carried that guy !   
<chandler> alright look ,  let &apos;s think about this ,  ok ,  do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time ?  that people are gonna post condolences on a website ?  this is not about people not caring that you &apos;re dead  . this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief .  
<ross> you &apos;re right .  there isn &apos;t a decent outlet .  
<chandler> right ,  i mean ,  come on ,  i &apos;m sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service ,  tons of people would come .  
<ross> exactly !  !   
<chandler> ross ,  what &apos;re you .  .  .  what &apos;re you .  .  .  what are you doing ?  you &apos;re having a memorial service for yourself !  ?  
<ross> no !  that would be stupid !  you &apos;re having it for me !  
<chandler> ross ,  don &apos;t press send ,  don &apos;t press se .  .  .   !

<rachel>  oh god .  
<joey>  .  .  .  she &apos;s being unreasonable !  
<rachel>  joey ,  there is a reason that emma loves that stupid penguin so much  oh don &apos;t cover its ears !   it &apos;s because it reminds her of her uncle joey !  
<joey> it does ?  
<rachel> yeah !  and she &apos;s comforted by him because she loves her uncle joey so much .  
<joey> really ?  she .  .  .  she loves me ?  
<rachel> oh yeah !  but you know what ?  if you need hugsy ,  don &apos;t worry .  emma will totally understand .  i won &apos;t .  .  .  but whatever  .  
<joey> ok ,  wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute ,  i mean rach ,  i mean if if .  .  .   .  if hugsy means that much to emma then .  .  .  well she can have him .

<s> it can &apos;t be any harder than this .  .  .  i mean ,  if i had known the last time i saw you would be the last time ,  i .  .  .  i would have stopped to memorize your face ,  the way you move ,  everything about you .  if i had known the last time i kissed you would have been the last time .  .  .  i never would have stopped .

<s> we weren &apos;t but we had one class together .  he was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science .  i always remembered him .  
<chandler> i &apos;m sure that would mean a lot to him .  and if heaven has a door ,  i &apos;m sure he &apos;s pressing his ear up against it and listening intently .  
<s> i thought so many times about calling him and asking him out .  i guess i really missed my chance .  
<ross>  but you didn &apos;t !  i &apos;m still alive !  !  kori ,  i know this is a big surprise for you .  it &apos;s a long story but the things you just said really made my day !  i mean ,  the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people !

<phoebe> oh can i ?  vegetarians never get to do the wishbone .  it &apos;s really not fair either !  you know ,  just because we don &apos;t eat the meat doesn &apos;t mean we don &apos;t like to play with the carcasses !

<monica> you know what ,  ross ?  i &apos;m gonna throw in 50 bucks for you .  
<ross> why ?  
<monica> because i know that you think the lottery is  &quot; boohaki &quot;  but we &apos;re all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun .  and you &apos;re my brother ,  and i want you to be a part of this .  
<ross> you don &apos;t have to do that ,  i &apos;ll pay for myself .  but just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys  -  that &apos;s so sweet !  come here  
<phoebe> get a room !  
<chandler> ok ,  so now that you &apos;re in ,  what are you gonna do if we win ?

<joey> seriously ,  that &apos;s your fantasy ?  to invest it ?

<rachel> i &apos;m hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word .  
<ross> although if we &apos;re gonna do that ,  we should probably call me  &quot; daddy &quot;  too .  
<phoebe> oooh ,  i like that ,   &quot; daddy &quot;   
<ross> i  .  .  .  i was just talking about rachel .

<rachel> ok ,  well this is like that .  .  . in no way .  i had a .  .  . i had a dream last night that i wanted to kiss joey .  
<monica> wow ,  do you mean like kiss him - kiss him ?  
<rachel> oh yeah !  i mean ,  that was pretty intense .  
<monica> what do you think brought than on ?  
<rachel> i don &apos;t know !  i mean ,  maybe that &apos;s something to do with the fact that i saw him do a love scene yesterday .  
<monica> a love scene ?  with who ?  
<rachel> olivia .  
<monica> olivia ?  i thought she was marrying connor !   oh right ,  real life more important .  
<rachel> so do you think that my dream means anything ?  
<monica> i don &apos;t know .  i mean ,  you saw him do a love scene ,  so maybe you don &apos;t have a thing for joey ,  maybe you have a thing for drake .  
<rachel> ah !  well it was joey reading drake &apos;s lines in the dream .  .  .  
<monica> of course it was !  trust me ,  when it comes to psychology i know what i &apos;m talking about .  i took two psych classes in college .  
<rachel> you took the same class twice .  
<monica> it was hard !   
<phoebe> hey !  
<phoebe> here ,  monica ,  look what i got to wear when i play at the restaurant  uh ,  huh wait !   right ?  i mean ,  this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man .  
<monica> oh .  .  . phoebe ?  maybe i wasn &apos;t clear before .  i really love listening to your music here ,  but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place .  
<phoebe> right ,  yeah ,  ok ,  i &apos;ll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault .  
<monica> phoebe ,  it &apos;s not what you wear .  it &apos;s sort of your songs .  .  .  i just don &apos;t think you should play at the restaurant anymore .  
<phoebe> oh ,  ok .  fine ,  i &apos;ll just ,  i &apos;ll take the hat back  .

<rachel> ok ,  we &apos;re still on that .  
<monica> i didn &apos;t say your songs were not good enough .  
<phoebe> then what &apos;s wrong with them ?  would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food ?  
<monica> tiny portions ?  
<phoebe> yeah well ,   &quot; excuse me ,  i ordered the smoked salmon appetizer ,  but  i can &apos;t see it ,  i can &apos;t see it &quot;  !  
<monica> phoebe ,  it &apos;s not about quantity .  
<phoebe> well .  .  . it &apos;s not about quality .  
<monica> oh really ,  you want to talk about quality ?  have you heard of a key ?  it &apos;s what some people sing in .  
<phoebe> well at least all my songs don &apos;t taste like garlic .  yeah ,  there are other ingredients monica .  
<monica> ok ,  so that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .  you know ,  when i &apos;m in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs ,  i &apos;m wearing ear plugs .  
<phoebe> ear plugs ,  or cloves of garlic ?  
<monica> you know what ?  i take back what i said before .  you keep playing at the restaurant ,  because with your music driving people inside ,  my bar sales are going up like crazy .  
<phoebe> what are people having ,  the garlic martini ?  
<chandler> oh we did ,  and you still have all your lamps .   
<chandler> oh ,  i didn &apos;t factor in the room tax .  
<ross> oh dude ,  don &apos;t worry about it ,  i found an unattended maid &apos;s car .  we &apos;re way ahead of the game .

<phoebe> you &apos;d better get back in that kitchen monica ,  the garlic is not gonna overuse itself .  
<monica> ok ,  you have to stop playing now .

<s> by a show of hands ,  how many of you were bothered by this woman &apos;s singing outside ?   
<phoebe> ok ,  ok ,  how many of you enjoyed the music outside ?   ha !  
<monica> alright ,  let me ask you this question the music was fine ,  but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant ?   .  
<phoebe> ok ,  well ,  who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky ?  
<monica> ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone ?   
<phoebe> ok ,  well ,  alright ,  who thinks the food is fine ,  the music was fine ,  but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking ?   .  
<monica> excuse us !   alright here &apos;s a question so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now ?   
<phoebe> oh .  .  . who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend &apos;s cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great !   
<monica> i &apos;m sorry .  .  .  
<phoebe> i &apos;m sorry too .  .  .   
<monica> ooohh .  .  .  hey !  wanna stick around and i &apos;ll whip you up some dinner ?

<joey> i was making a peanut butter smoothy ,  right ?  
<rachel> uh - huh 
<joey> and i couldn &apos;t find this little plastic thing  that goes on top of the blender .  .  . and i thought .  .  . well .  .  .  how important can that be ,  right .  .  .  ?  turns out very !  
<rachel>  wow .  .  . definitely just drake .  .  .  
<joey> what ?  
<rachel> what .  .  . how is it going with drake ?  
<joey> oh .  .  . i don &apos;t think it &apos;s going very well .  .  .  
<rachel> what .  .  . that scene i saw was so good !  
<joey> well ,  i &apos;m feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow .  .  .  
<rachel> joey ,  is this that thing that you do when you say you &apos;re bad so i &apos;ll give you a compliment ?  
<joey> a little .  yeah no ,  i really am worried ,  you know ,  i mean i have to make it convincing that i &apos;m in love with olivia .  
<rachel> so ?  
<joey> so .  .  . i &apos;ve never played that !  
<rachel> ooh !  honey ,  it can &apos;t be that hard ,  i mean ,  you &apos;ve been in love before ?  
<joey> uh .  .  . well .  .  . just once .  .  . with you .  .  .  
<rachel> ok .  .  . this could be a little awkward .  .  . i &apos;m just going to blow past it .  .  .  well can &apos;t you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance ?  
<joey>  what the hell are you talking about ?  ?  
<rachel>  alright ,  alright look ,  just uh .  .  .  just try to remember how you felt when you were in love ,  and think about that when you &apos;re playing the scene .  
<joey>  oh !  ok ,  yeah ,  i think i can do that .  yeah ok ,  there &apos;s this party scene coming up .  .  and olivia and her husband are there and all drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her ,  but he can &apos;t .  .  .  and that makes me think about all those times when i wanted to grab you and kiss you ,  but you didn &apos;t know so i would just pretend everything was cool ,  but really ,  it was killing me .  
<rachel>  joey ,  you never .  . you never talked about that before .  .  .  
<joey> well .  .  hey ,  you know what else i could use ?  there &apos;s a scene where drake sneaks into olivia &apos;s bedroom ,  and she doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s there  -  which never happened with us !  and he knows he shouldn &apos;t be there ,  but he just wants to look at her .  .  .  you know ?   and i remember all those mornings before you even put on your make - up ,  when i would think to myself ,  my god ,  she .  .  . is .  .  .  beautiful .  .  .   and it hurts so much ,  cuz i knew i could never tell you  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you .

<rachel> phoebe ,  come on ,  i don &apos;t wanna waste it !  it would be like throwing away a hundred bucks !  
<phoebe> ok ,  this is not about the money ,  ok ?  it &apos;s about .  .  .  it &apos;s about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us .  .  .  the hollow shells .

<chandler> we really need to take those tests ?  
<monica> honey ,  we &apos;ve been trying to have a baby for over a year .  i think it &apos;s a good idea to find out if everything &apos;s ok .  just a few routine tests .  
<chandler> but i don &apos;t wanna do it in a cup !  
<monica> what is the big deal ?  
<chandler> it &apos;s weird !  in a doctor &apos;s office ?  
<monica> it &apos;s not ok to do it in a doctor &apos;s office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a taco bell ?  
<chandler>  i cannot believe ross told you that !   and in my defense ,  it was a wendy &apos;s !  
<monica> look ,  i don &apos;t wanna do this test either ,  but i really do think it &apos;s a good idea !  
<chandler> yeah ,  ok .  i &apos;m sure that doctor &apos;s office can &apos;t be worst than on a class trip to the hershey &apos;s factory !

<joey> (shaking his head as if to say says the words ,  my brain is thinking monster trucks !  
<ross> ok now ,  remember ,  when you get to the museum ,  monet is not spelt m - o - n - a - y .  i just .  .  .  i wrote that out phonetically for you .  
<joey> phonetically ?   
<ross> yeah ,  yeah that means .  .  .  you know ?  we just .  .  .  we don &apos;t have time for this .  
<joey> ok .  
<ross> ok ,  but you know what ?  i gotta say ,  i &apos;m really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly !  
<joey> ah !  i &apos;m an actor !  i can memorize anything !  last week on  &quot; days &quot;  i had to say  &quot; frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy &quot;  .  
<ross> wow .  what does that mean ?  
<joey> no idea !  but the guy i said it to dies in the next scene so i guess it means  &quot; you &apos;re gonna get eaten by a bear &quot;  .  
<ross> ok !  so let &apos;s move on to the renaissance ?  
<joey> ok ,  caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure .  touch it ,  it &apos;s really bumpy !   .  
<ross> nah ah !  nah ah !   no no no !  no ad - libbing and dude ,  you can &apos;t touch the paintings .

<chandler> yeah !  yeah .  .  .  the hard part is over !  
<s> that &apos;s not the hard part honey !  the hard part is what comes next ,  i mean aren &apos;t you worried about the results ?  
<chandler> i haven &apos;t .  .  .  i haven &apos;t even thought about the results yet .  .  .  i just assumed that everything was gonna be ok .  
<s> oh !  well ,  you know what ?  it probably is .  
<chandler>  yeah ,  but what if it &apos;s not ?  what if there is a reason why we can &apos;t have a baby ?  
<s> oh ,  chandler ,  look .  you and monica are meant to have children .  i am sure it &apos;s gonna be just fine .  
<chandler>  oh ,  oh ,  yeah ,  ok ,  thanks .  i can &apos;t believe i didn &apos;t even think of that .  i guess i was just so worried about having to .  .  .  come here and do .  .  .   &apos;that &apos; .  .  .  
<s> what ,  you can do it in the parking lot of a taco bell ,  but you can &apos;t do it at a doctor &apos;s office ?  
<chandler>  it was a  &quot; wendy &apos;s !  !   &quot;  
<rachel> wow ,  ikea .  .  .  what a rich culture .  uhm ,  you know what ?  i have a friend who is a masseuse .

<rachel> yah !  she &apos;s .  .  .  uhm .  .  .  not very good though .  .  .   
<phoebe> uhu ,  uhu .  .  .  and why do you think that is ?  
<rachel> i don &apos;t know .  .  .  maybe it &apos;s because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar .  .  .  
<phoebe> or .  .  .  maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you &apos;re such a high maintenance tight ass !  
<rachel>  phoebe !  !  
<phoebe> you know it &apos;s me ?  
<rachel> for like a half an hour !  man ,  you can lie about sweden !  
<phoebe> how can you come here ?  
<rachel> how could you not tell me you worked here ?  
<phoebe> i don &apos;t have to tell you everything !  
<rachel> yes you do ,  if you &apos;re going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage !  
<phoebe> tips not included .  
<rachel> oh !  phoebe ,  why did you lie to me about working here ?  
<phoebe> because i was ashamed ok ?  i sold out for the cash !  and then they give me benefits like medical ,  and dental ,  and a 401k .  but you know .  .  .  you pay a price .  now i &apos;m this corporate stooge and punching a clock and ugh !  paying taxes !  
<rachel> phoebe ,  honey ,  if you hate it so much ,  you should walk out there right now and quit !  be true to what you believe in !  honey ,  you have principles and i so admire that !  i don &apos;t have any !  
<phoebe> you know what ?  you are right .  i am gonna quit .  it &apos;s time i took my life back !

<ross>  respectfully ,  professor r .  geller .   hey !  
<s> hi !  
<ross> hey ,  how was the met ?  
<s> the museum was amazing !  
<ross> yeah ?  joey really knows his art ,  huh ?  
<s> not so much ,  no .  he had clearly memorized all the stuff to say ,  and some of it didn &apos;t even make any sense .  
<ross> what do you mean ?  
<s> well ,  for one ,  he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around .  
<ross>  wait a minute .  .  .  when you guys walked into the met ,  did you go to the right ?  
<s> no ,  we went to the left .  
<ross>  oh joey ,  joey !  but still ,  i mean ,  it seems like you guys are having a great time together .  
<s> yeah ,  it &apos;s fun  .  
<ross> what ?

<ross>  yeah .  but you know what ?  i think you should give joey a chance .  i mean ,  he &apos;s a great guy ,  and sure he doesn &apos;t know that much about art but you know ,  you can always talk about that with someone else .  
<s> yeah ,  i guess that &apos;s true .  
<ross> and if you think about it ,  i mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you .  you know ,  that &apos;s the kind of guy joey is .  
<s> he is very sweet .  plus he &apos;s hot !  
<ross> that was going to be my next argument .

<s> umh .  .  .  kurts baley ?  
<ross> yeah ,  right !  what was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract  well ,  why are you laughing ?  
<joey> just .  .  .  seeing what it &apos;d be like to be a paleontologist .  .  .  it &apos;s fun ,  yeah !  
<s> so you &apos;re up for keynote speaker !  who &apos;s making the decisions ?  
<ross> professor sherman ,  yeah .  i &apos;ve a meeting with him today .  
<s> he &apos;s a pretty tough guy to impress .  
<ross> yeah ,  well .  .  .  i think i know how to dazzle him .  
<rachel> oh .  .  .  you &apos;re not gonna do a magic trick ,  are ya ?  
<ross> tsz .  .  .  no !   .  
<chandler>  hey guys !  
<ross> wait a minute ,  you guys .  oh ,  i wanna ask you something .  i - i i may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if i do ,  i &apos;d love for you guys to come and hear me .  
<chandler> i think i can safely say that we all have family issues ,  work stuff and / or are sick .  
<ross> it &apos;s in barbados .  
<chandler> but you come first !  
<rachel> i &apos;m there !  
<s> we &apos;ll see you ,  guys !   
<joey> bye .  
<rachel> bye ,  see ya .   
<chandler>  ok .  
<joey> all right ,  so .  how did it go at the fertility clinic ?  
<chandler> not as much fun as last time .  apparently you only get porn if you &apos;re giving a sperm sample .  
<ross> so - so what did the doctor say ?  
<chandler> well .  .  .  there &apos;s surrogacy ,  but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child ,  she has felt that watching a surrogate would be .  .  .  too hard for her .  
<joey> so you &apos;re ruling out surrogacy ?  
<chandler> yeah .  
<joey> so ,  i don &apos;t have to learn what that means ?  
<chandler> aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination ,  so .  .  .  we &apos;re talking about sperm donors .  
<joey> enough said ,  i &apos;m there for you man .  where is she ,  upstairs ?  
<chandler>  ah - ha !  
<ross> how do you feel about all this ?  
<chandler> i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but i don &apos;t think there is one .  
<joey> come on ross ,  be a good guy .  step up and do it !  
<ross>  what ?   
<ross>  what ?  no !  i am not going to give them ben !  
<ross>  i mean ,  we &apos;ve been accepting leakey &apos;s dates as a given ,  but if they &apos;re off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can  -  you can just throw most of our assumptions ,  you know ,  right in the trash .   so - so what i am saying is  -  is is that  is that the repercussions could be huge !  i mean ,  not just in palaeontology ,  but if - if you think about it ,  in evolutionary biology ,  uh ,  genetics ,  geology ,  uh ,  i mean ,  truly the mind boggles !   
<ross> oh ,  that &apos;s not what you want .  .  .  
<rachel> pheebs ,  that &apos;s for men !  
<phoebe> no ,  i know ,  this way when i go to the party later mike will know i am over him cause i &apos;m gonna smell like another guy .   yeah .   
<phoebe> ok .  oh good ,  i &apos;m dating a russian cab driver .   .  seriously does anyone buy this ?  i smell like beets !  
<s>  so ,  you know what ,  i really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them .  where do you think those would be ?  
<rachel> on melanie griffith in  &quot; working girl &quot;  .  i think what you want is over here .

<s> wha ,  you know ,  maybe we can do something else !  
<rachel> you know that depends on what it is !  i &apos;ve done a lot of stuff .   
<phoebe> so what were you doing out there ,  do you not like charlie ?  
<rachel> she &apos;s ok ,  i just don &apos;t get a really good vibe from her !  
<phoebe> why ?  
<rachel> i don &apos;t know ,  you know ,  just the way she waltzed in here all smart ,  and tall !  you know ,  and just swept joey off his feet .  .  .  i mean ,  nobody else has a chance !

<phoebe> uh ,  wow !  isn &apos;t it ironic that he liked you and now you like him ?  
<rachel>  oh ,  i get it !  
<phoebe> oh well ,  as long as it is under control ,  you know ,  you can &apos;t do anything about it ,  he &apos;s already dating her ,  and she is a nice person ,  that wouldn &apos;t be right .  
<rachel> i know ,  i know ,  so it is just not a big deal .  
<phoebe> yeah .  
<rachel> so can we keep this between us ?  
<phoebe> sure !

<chandler> well ,  we &apos;re talking about sperm donors and zack may be the guy !  i mean ,  look ,  he &apos;s intelligent ,  he &apos;s healthy ,  he &apos;s athletic ,  i mean ,  he is  &quot; spermtastic &quot;  !

<monica> chandler !  
<chandler> i &apos;m telling you ,  he &apos;s great !  i mean ,  even if my sperm worked fine ,  i &apos;d think he &apos;d be the way to go !

<chandler> ok !

<monica> does seem pretty perfect .  
<chandler> yeah ,  you think so ,  well ?  should i ask him ?

<chandler> why not ,  just because his great - grandmother was obese ,  our kids are gonna get that from you anyway !  
<monica> no ,  that &apos;s not it .  it &apos;s just that when we were asking him all those questions before ,  i just .  .  .  i just realized i don &apos;t care if he &apos;s the most perfect guy in the world .  .  .  he &apos;s not you .  
<chandler> yeah ,  he &apos;s better !

<phoebe> yeah .  
<monica> i mean ,  my feelings for richard are certainly gone .  
<phoebe> you just did it again .  chandler ,  your feelings for chandler are certainly gone !  
<chandler> i wouldn &apos;t read too much into it .  
<s> still you know ,  a girl calls you by your ex - boyfriend &apos;s name ,  that - that &apos;s not a good thing ,  right ?  
<chandler> david ,  let me stop you there  &apos;cause i think i see where this is going .  i &apos;m not very good at giving advice .  so if you want advice ,  go to ross ,  monica ,  or .  .  .  joey ,  if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee .  
<s> sorry ,  i just .  .  .  i wish there was something i could do ,  you know ?  well ,  you know phoebe .  .  .  
<chandler> seriously ,  we &apos;re gonna do this ?  
<s> i &apos;m sorry ,  uh .  .  .  i just wish i could make her forget about mike already ,  you know .  .  .  why did phoebe and mike break up ?  
<chandler> oh ,  because his penis was too big .   oh ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  that &apos;s the kind of thing i do .   they broke up because mike didn &apos;t want to get married .  hey ,  what if you just let phoebe know you &apos;d be open to marriage ?  
<s> that &apos;s great !  that &apos;s great !  i - i &apos;ll propose to her !  
<chandler> what ?  
<s> well ,  i was probably going to do it at some point .  
<chandler> i didn &apos;t mean now .  .  .  
<s> why not ?  it &apos;s brilliant !   goodbye mike ,  we &apos;ll see you at the wedding ,  fella !   well ,  we probably won &apos;t invite you to the wedding .  .  .   thank you ,  chandler .  sincerely .  
<chandler> well ,  you &apos;re welcome !  glad i could help .  
<s>  how do you think i should propose ?  
<chandler> david ,  i &apos;m pretending to read here !  !  
<  
<joey> yeah !  how you doin &apos; ?  yeah alright !   
<joey> hey ,  hey !  you said you &apos;re gonna wear a thong ,  where &apos;s the thong ?  
<s>  i didn &apos;t mean a thong .  .  .  i meant thongs .  .  .  
<joey> you really should have been more clear about that !   
<ross> hey !  
<joey> hey !  
<ross>  you &apos;re never going to guess who i just saw downstairs !  
<joey> oh !  ah !  eh .  .  .  britney spears !  ?  
<ross> yeah ,  she never misses these conferences !   no ,  i just saw dr .  kenneth schwartz !  
<s> oh my god !  did you talk to him ?  
<ross> yeah .  .  .  what am i going to say to kenneth schwartz ?  
<joey> you could say 
<ross>  ready to go ?  
<s> yeah !  
<joey> wha .  .  .  ?  you &apos;re gonna go now ?  i thought we could hang out ?  
<s> oh i can &apos;t .  .  .  i have seminars all day and i promised ross i would look at his speech .  
<ross> yeah .  
<s> but maybe we can have dinner later ?  on the balcony ?  will be romantic .  
<joey>  will you wear a thong ?  
<s> i will if you will .  
<joey> oh .  .  .  you got yourself a very weird deal !  
<ross>  i &apos;m good ,  i have dinner plans  .  
<s> so you &apos;ll be ok ?  
<joey> yeah ,  yeah .  i &apos;ve got tons of stuff i could do .  i &apos;m gonna hit the beach ,  go swimming .  .  .  
<ross> uh ,  joe ,  have you looked outside ?  
<joey> no ,  why ?   
<joey> oh man !  
<s> there &apos;s an indoor pool ,  you can swim there !   
<joey> i wasn &apos;t gonna swim ,  i was gonna dig a hole !   
<chandler>  i do !  want a hint ?  huh ?   &quot; i do &quot;    &quot; i do &quot;  .  
<monica> ok ,  i &apos;m sensing that this is some kind of word play ,  because you are pink with barely controlled glee .  
<chandler> david is going to propose to phoebe .  
<monica> what ?   why ?  
<chandler> be - cause ,  we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married .  
<monica> chandler ,  we have talked about this .  you are not supposed to give people advice !  now couldn &apos;t you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke ?  
<chandler> i did !  a penis one !  look ,  just so i know ,  what was so wrong about what i said ?  
<monica> they &apos;ve only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike !  she &apos;ll say  &quot; no &quot;  ,  david &apos;s heart will be broken ,  it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again .  
<chandler> man ,  that &apos;s some bad advice !  
<  
<joey> oh !  hey !  thank god you guys are here !  
<rachel> hey !  hey what &apos;s going on ?  
<joey> everything is upside down here !  it rains all day long ,  nobody watches tv and ross is famous !   
<rachel> alright ,  i don &apos;t wanna alarm anybody ,  but monica &apos;s hair is twice as big as it was when we landed !   
<monica> ok !  when i go places with high humidity ,  it gets a little extra body ,  ok ?  !  
<chandler> that &apos;s why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross !  
<joey> come on ,  i &apos;ll show you guys where to check in  
<monica>  oh ,  honey ,  can you make sure we get a king size bed !  
<phoebe>  oh !  david ,  get one for us too !  oh ,  oh ,  and see if they have a heart - shaped one !  and with mirrors on the ceiling !  
<monica>  and make sure our room isn &apos;t next to theirs  .  
<rachel> ooh !  you guys are so lucky you are here with people ,  you known it &apos;s such a romantic place .  that &apos;s all ,  i just wish i could  share that with a guy .  
<phoebe> not joey .  
<rachel> not joey ,  no ,  i was just lusting after chandler .  
<monica> yeah ,  right !   
<s> so ,  ehm .  .  .  i &apos;m proposing to pheobe tonight .   
<chandler> tonight ?  !   isn &apos;t an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond ?   oh ,  there it is !  
<s> yeah ,  well ,  being a failed scientist doesn &apos;t pay quite as well as you might think .  that &apos;s uhm .  .  .  one seventieth of a karat .  and the clarity is uhm .  .  .  is quite poor .  
<chandler>  nice !   
<chandler> monica ,  can i talk to you for a sec ?   
<monica> ok !  
<chandler> david is going to propose to phoebe tonight !  
<monica> see what happens when you give people advice ?  i hope you told him not to ?  
<chandler> that would be advice !  !  
<monica> ok fine .  i &apos;ll handle this .   phoebe ?  
<phoebe> yeah ?  
<monica>  i need to talk to you .  
<phoebe> are you leaving  &quot; the supremes &quot;  ?

<monica> what are you serious ?  you wanna marry him ?  wha .  .  .  what about mike ?  
<phoebe> oh ,  ok ,  you want me to marry mike ?  alright ,  well ,  let &apos;s just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle .  i can just see it 
<monica> do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer ?  
<phoebe> sure !  look ,  ok ,  bottom line 
<s> it &apos;s great .  you &apos;re gonna be the hit of the conference .  
<ross> oh and you know what ,  it will be even better tomorrow ,  because i won &apos;t be constantly interrupted by joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet .   .

<s> kinda stepped on the toes of what i was going to say .  
<s> sorry david ,  but she really has to know this .  
<s> alright ,  but after this i want to see you outside .  if the rain stops .  
<monica> you &apos;re the most incredible woman i &apos;ve ever met .  how can i lose you ?   now ,  i don &apos;t actually have a ring .  .  .  
<s> i have a ring .  
<chandler> i wouldn &apos;t brag too much about that thing ,  big guy .  
<s> phoebe ,  will you marry me ?  
<phoebe>  no !  
<s> uhm .  .  .  ha ha !  
<phoebe> i love you .  but i never needed a proposal from you .  i just needed to know that we were headed somewhere ,  you know ,  that we had a future .  
<s> we can have any future you want .   
<s> ok ,  i &apos;m gonna take off .  
<phoebe> david ,  i &apos;m so sorry ,  i &apos;m sorry .  
<s> just so i know ,  if i had asked first .  .  .  
<phoebe> yeah ,  i might have said yes ,  but that would have been wrong .  
<s> please ,  you don &apos;t have to explain .  i mean ,  perhaps if i hadn &apos;t gone to minsk things would have worked out for us .  and i wouldn &apos;t have ruined my career ,  or lost that toe to frostbite .  it was a good trip !   
<s> is it ok if i hug you now ?  
<phoebe> yes !   
<monica>  because of our meddling !  alright ?  
<monica> i know   
<rachel>  open your drapes !  open your drapes !  
<chandler> i &apos;m so glad we &apos;ve got adjoining rooms !   
<monica> the sun is out !  
<chandler> hey !  remember when i had corneas ?  
<monica> ok listen ,  you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs ,  and i &apos;ll get the magazines and the lotion .  
<chandler> ladies ?  ross &apos;s speech is in 45 minutes .  
<rachel> nooo !  
<monica> damn it !  
<ross>  walls are pretty thin ,  guys !  
<rachel> look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan .  .  .  so leathery and wrinkled ,  i &apos;m so jealous !  
<ross> finally ,  factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered 
<chandler>  not to mention the cold sores .   
<ross> and that &apos;s just the herbivores .  i &apos;m not even gonna discuss the carnivores ,  their heads are already too big .  which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development .   
<chandler>  really ?  
<ross> but all kidding aside ,  in much the same way that homo ergaster  is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus .  .  .   
<s> what ?  
<joey> he said  &quot; erectus &quot;  !  
<s> you &apos;re .  .  .  you &apos;re kidding ,  right ?  
<joey> no ,  he really said it .  
<ross>  .  .  .  and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus .  .  .   
<joey> erectus ?  
<rachel> homo .  
<ross> oh ,  thanks guys !  
<ross> oh !

<chandler> david ,  let me stop you there  &apos;cause i think i see where this is going .  i &apos;m not very good at giving advice .  so if you want advice ,  go to ross ,  monica ,  or .  .  .  joey ,  if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee .  
<s> sorry ,  i just .  .  .  i wish there was something i could do ,  you know ?  well ,  you know phoebe .  .  .  
<chandler> seriously ,  we &apos;re gonna do this ?  
<s> i &apos;m sorry ,  uh .  .  .  i just wish i could make her forget about mike already ,  you know .  .  .  why did phoebe and mike break up ?  
<chandler> oh ,  because his penis was too big .   oh ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  that &apos;s the kind of thing i do .   they broke up because mike didn &apos;t want to get married .  hey ,  what if you just let phoebe know you &apos;d be open to marriage ?  
<s> that &apos;s great !  that &apos;s great !  i - i &apos;ll propose to her !

<s> why not ?  it &apos;s brilliant !   goodbye mike ,  we &apos;ll see you at the wedding ,  fella !   well ,  we probably won &apos;t invite you to the wedding .  .  .   thank you ,  chandler .  sincerely .  
<chandler> well ,  you &apos;re welcome !  glad i could help .

<ross> hey !  
<joey> hey !

<joey> oh !  ah !  eh .  .  .  britney spears !  ?  
<ross> yeah ,  she never misses these conferences !   no ,  i just saw dr .  kenneth schwartz !  
<s> oh my god !  did you talk to him ?

<chandler>  i do !  want a hint ?  huh ?   &quot; i do &quot;    &quot; i do &quot;  .  
<monica> ok ,  i &apos;m sensing that this is some kind of word play ,  because you are pink with barely controlled glee .  
<chandler> david is going to propose to phoebe .  
<monica> what ?   why ?  
<chandler> be - cause ,  we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married .  
<monica> chandler ,  we have talked about this .  you are not supposed to give people advice !  now couldn &apos;t you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke ?  
<chandler> i did !  a penis one !  look ,  just so i know ,  what was so wrong about what i said ?  
<monica> they &apos;ve only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike !  she &apos;ll say  &quot; no &quot;  ,  david &apos;s heart will be broken ,  it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again .  
<chandler> man ,  that &apos;s some bad advice !  
<  
<joey> oh !  hey !  thank god you guys are here !  
<rachel> hey !  hey what &apos;s going on ?  
<joey> everything is upside down here !  it rains all day long ,  nobody watches tv and ross is famous !   
<rachel> alright ,  i don &apos;t wanna alarm anybody ,  but monica &apos;s hair is twice as big as it was when we landed !   
<monica> ok !  when i go places with high humidity ,  it gets a little extra body ,  ok ?  !  
<chandler> that &apos;s why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross !  
<joey> come on ,  i &apos;ll show you guys where to check in  
<monica>  oh ,  honey ,  can you make sure we get a king size bed !  
<phoebe>  oh !  david ,  get one for us too !  oh ,  oh ,  and see if they have a heart - shaped one !  and with mirrors on the ceiling !  
<monica>  and make sure our room isn &apos;t next to theirs  .  
<rachel> ooh !  you guys are so lucky you are here with people ,  you known it &apos;s such a romantic place .  that &apos;s all ,  i just wish i could  share that with a guy .

<s> so ,  ehm .  .  .  i &apos;m proposing to pheobe tonight .   
<chandler> tonight ?  !   isn &apos;t an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond ?   oh ,  there it is !  
<s> yeah ,  well ,  being a failed scientist doesn &apos;t pay quite as well as you might think .  that &apos;s uhm .  .  .  one seventieth of a karat .  and the clarity is uhm .  .  .  is quite poor .

<s> i have a question i need to ask you .

<s>  ok ,  would you care for my seat as well ?  
<s> actually yeah ,  that &apos;ll be great .  
<s> that &apos;s fair ,  you &apos;ve had a long trip .   
<s> phoebe ,  i love you .  i mean ,  i missed you so much these last few months and i thought we were apart for a good reason ,  but then i suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you .  
<s> kinda stepped on the toes of what i was going to say .  
<s> sorry david ,  but she really has to know this .  
<s> alright ,  but after this i want to see you outside .  if the rain stops .  
<monica> you &apos;re the most incredible woman i &apos;ve ever met .  how can i lose you ?   now ,  i don &apos;t actually have a ring .  .  .  
<s> i have a ring .  
<chandler> i wouldn &apos;t brag too much about that thing ,  big guy .  
<s> phoebe ,  will you marry me ?  
<phoebe>  no !  
<s> uhm .  .  .  ha ha !  
<phoebe> i love you .  but i never needed a proposal from you .  i just needed to know that we were headed somewhere ,  you know ,  that we had a future .  
<s> we can have any future you want .   
<s> ok ,  i &apos;m gonna take off .  
<phoebe> david ,  i &apos;m so sorry ,  i &apos;m sorry .  
<s> just so i know ,  if i had asked first .  .  .  
<phoebe> yeah ,  i might have said yes ,  but that would have been wrong .  
<s> please ,  you don &apos;t have to explain .  i mean ,  perhaps if i hadn &apos;t gone to minsk things would have worked out for us .  and i wouldn &apos;t have ruined my career ,  or lost that toe to frostbite .  it was a good trip !   
<s> is it ok if i hug you now ?  
<phoebe> yes !   
<monica>  because of our meddling !  alright ?

<monica> damn it !  
<ross>  walls are pretty thin ,  guys !  
<rachel> look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan .  .  .  so leathery and wrinkled ,  i &apos;m so jealous !  
<ross> finally ,  factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered 
<chandler>  not to mention the cold sores .   
<ross> and that &apos;s just the herbivores .  i &apos;m not even gonna discuss the carnivores ,  their heads are already too big .  which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development .   
<chandler>  really ?  
<ross> but all kidding aside ,  in much the same way that homo ergaster  is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus .  .  .   
<s> what ?  
<joey> he said  &quot; erectus &quot;  !  
<s> you &apos;re .  .  .  you &apos;re kidding ,  right ?  
<joey> no ,  he really said it .  
<ross>  .  .  .  and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus .  .  .   
<joey> erectus ?  
<rachel> homo .  
<ross> oh ,  thanks guys !  
<ross> oh !

<s>  i was not !  
<ross> no ,  it &apos;s ok !  made me feel like a rock star !  
<s> oh my god !   i &apos;m your groupie !  
<ross>  i &apos;d better not found you naked in my hotel room !

<phoebe> shhh .  .  .  this is the listening side of the wall .

<rachel>  uh - huh .  .  .  right .  .  .  yeah .  .  .  
<ross> and you know i wanted to ask charlie out since the day i met her .  
<rachel>  oh ,  i know .  .  .  i know it &apos;s been really hard for you .

<phoebe> well ,  alright ,  that &apos;s fine .  what about leslie ?  she &apos;s ,  she &apos;s the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet .

<chandler> we have to leave !  !  
<monica> why ?  what did you do in the bathroom ?  
<chandler> i didn &apos;t get to the bathroom .  i bumped into owen on the way ,  and he didn &apos;t know he was adopted .  and there &apos;s a slight chance i may have told him .  
<monica> oh my god ,  where &apos;s my purse ?  no ,  you know what ?  i can replace everything in there .  get that binder ,  and let &apos;s go !   
<s> hey .  
<s> some little snacks for everybody .  oh ,  you don &apos;t have to eat the sour worms .  those are for owen .  
<s> i &apos;ll go get him in a second .  by the way ,  you should know we haven &apos;t told him he &apos;s adopted yet .  
<chandler> but kids are so intuitive .  don &apos;t you think on some level he already knows ?   
<s> i &apos;m adopted ?  !  
<chandler> see ?  intuitive !  
<s> what ?  where did you hear that ?  
<s> he told me !  and he paid me 50 dollars not to tell .  
<chandler> which technically now you should give back !  
<s> you told him he &apos;s adopted ?  
<chandler> i &apos;m so sorry ,  but you should have a sign out there or something .  or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door .   &quot; owen doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s adopted ,  and he also thinks that santa is real .  &quot;

<joey> dude ,  are you okay ?

<rachel> well ,  can &apos;t you just go to vermont the next day ?

<monica> believe me ,  that is not why we won &apos;t be doing that !  opening credits 
<phoebe> oooh ,  i love family traditions like that .  when uhm .  .  .  when ursula and i were kids ,  on our birthday ,  our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food !  
<ross>  hey guys !  rachel 
<ross> hey ,  i brought the camera for emma &apos;s video .  
<rachel> oh ,  good ,  good !  we had this idea to make a birthday video for emma and we &apos;ll give it to her when she is 18 .  
<phoebe> oh ,  cool !  !  wow ,  it &apos;s like a time capsule !  
<ross> yeah !  
<phoebe> oh ,  just think .  .  .  she &apos;s gonna be watching that video on a tv that hasn &apos;t even been invented yet !  with friends who right now are just like babies !  and they &apos;ll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people !

<joey> no ,  no ,  no !  my talents as an actor !  
<phoebe> oh !

<ross> rach ,  she &apos;s not going to remember this .  
<rachel>  i guess .  .  .  oh ,  i just had such an idea of what this day would be like ,  you know ?  emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing  &quot; happy birthday &quot;  .  then we would all go into .  .  .  hey get out of the road you stupid student driver !  !  !   they have to learn !  
<ross>  hey !

<rachel> oh !  phoebe ,  all babies are beautiful !  
<phoebe>  oh .  .  .  okay .  
<rachel> phoebe ,  just the idea of pitting one baby against another ,  i mean ,  you know ,  and judging who &apos;s cuter just for a trophy .  .  .  
<rachel> and a thousand dollars .  
<rachel>  .  .  . is something i &apos;m very interested in !  oh please ,  do not tell ross .  he still believes that  what &apos;s in the inside is important .  .  .  
<phoebe> okay ,  oh ,  and emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition .  
<rachel> where am i gonna get a cowgirl outfit on thanksgiving ?

<chandler> why come all the way from kansas to do that ?  
<monica>  i don &apos;t get older .  i just get better !

<monica> ok ,  let &apos;s see .  .  .  uhm ,  okay ,  the turkey is in the oven ,  the stuffing is ready .  .  .  
<chandler> you know ,  you always cook this meal all by yourself .  let me help this year .  
<monica> oh ,  chandler ,  that &apos;s sweet .  but you don &apos;t have to do everything doctor phil tells you to do .  
<chandler> i &apos;m serious ,  let me do something ,  just not the turkey or the stuffing ,  nothing  &quot; high profile &quot;  .  
<monica> ok ,  let &apos;s see .  .  .  oh ,  the cranberry sauce ,  it is easy to make and no - one really cares about it .  
<chandler> tell me more .  
<monica> okay ,  i &apos;m gonna go check on something across the hall .  you start by washing these  not with soap !  !

<joey> so we &apos;ll leave before it &apos;s over ,  we &apos;ll be back in time .  
<chandler> you say that now ,  but it could take us a long time to get back home .  plus joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up .  
<joey> dude ,  two times that happened !  
<chandler> look ,  monica has been working hard all day ,  she didn &apos;t wanna host this thing in the first place ,  we shouldn &apos;t go !  
<ross> he &apos;s right ,  man .

<ross> so ,  youre saying ,  uh ,  if i wear these pants i might be getting into hers ?  
<rachel>  why do men keep talking to me like this ?  
<s> yeah ,  i read some great applications ,  but then i thought who better then a minister to raise a child !  
<monica> amen .  
<chandler> plus i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor !  
<monica> uh ,  good hands .   healing hands .  
<s> reverend ,  can i ask ?  does the bible say anything about adoption ?  
<monica> it says  &quot; do it !  &quot;  and behold she did adopt unto them a baby .  and it was good .  
<s> wow .  
<chandler> yeah ,  wow .  
<s> i was wondering you both have such serious jobs .   would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock ?  
<monica> oh ,  you know ,  my flock is good ,  i mean ,  yeah ,  my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point .  good flock .  flock ,  flock ,  flock .  
<s>  being a doctor must take up a lot of time .  
<chandler> not for me it doesnt .   
<s> were great ,  i think i may have asked all my questions .  
<chandler> yeah ,  actually .  so ,  you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us ?  were very proud of it .  
<chandler> you should be .  youre really on top of stuff .  .  nothing else ,  then the two of us should talk .  
<s> actually ,  i dont think we have to .  
<monica> we dont ?  
<s> yeah ,  when i read about you two ,  i was pretty sure i wanted you ,  but i just thought we should meet face to face .   .  i &apos;ve made my decision .  i choose them .  
<monica> oh my god ,  this is great !  this is so great !   .  did you hear that ?  
<chandler> yeah ,  i did .  
<monica>  hey ,  thank you .  thank you so much .   .  you are so going to heaven !  
<phoebe> yeah ,  yeah but i am not sure about some of the bra &apos;s i got .  
<rachel> oh !  really ?  do you wanna try some of them on for me ?  
<phoebe> oh !  okay .  wait ,  are we in joey &apos;s imagination ?  
<rachel>  oh no !  i took one of ross &apos; bags by mistake ,  and one of mine is missing .  
<phoebe> oh ,  well ,  ross probably has it ,  you can get it from him later .  
<joey> i think were not wearing the same shirt anymore !  !  
<ross>  yeah !  yeah !  rachel picked it out for me .  she told me to trust her and you know what ?  i &apos;m glad i did !  i turned quite a few heads on my way over here .  
<joey>  dude ,  i really don &apos;t think you should be wearing that .  
<ross> oh ,  i see ,  somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies ?  
<joey>  looks like someone is the ladies !  !  
<ross> you &apos;re just jealous because you couldn &apos;t pull this off .  yeah ,  now if you &apos;ll excuse me  i have a date .   see ?   all eyes on me !  
<monica> why not ?  
<chandler> it &apos;s wrong .  they made a mistake .  they think we &apos;re somebody else .  
<monica> god works in mysterious ways .  
<chandler> you have gotta stop !  
<monica> but she liked us .  
<chandler> she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica .  
<monica> well ,  if you think about it ,  i am kind of like a reverend .  i mean ,  as a chef ,  i serve god ,  by feeing the hungry and poor .   
<chandler> your veal chop is $34 . 95 !  
<monica> c &apos;mon chandler ,  i think we have been given an opportunity .  i mean ,  the mistake has already been made .  they are writing up the paper right now .  
<chandler> but we are not the one she chose !  how can you feel okay about this ?  
<monica>  because .  .  .  we may not be who she thinks we are but no - one will ever love that baby more than us .  
<chandler> i know .  .  
<monica> i mean ,  who knows how long it &apos;s gonna take for someone else to give us a baby ?  what if ,  what if no one ever picks us ?  
<chandler> oh ,  honey .  .  
<monica>  please .  .  please ,  we are so close .  
<chandler> monica ,  i want a baby too ,  but this woman is giving away her child .  she deserves to know who it &apos;s going to .  
<monica>  okay ,  right .   
<chandler> so ,  we &apos;ll tell the truth and who knows ,  maybe she &apos;ll like us for us .  
<monica>  maybe she will .  uh !  why couldn &apos;t i have been a reverend ?  
<chandler> you &apos;re jewish .

<monica> look ,  doctor !   look ,  before we sign anything we really have to talk .  .  .  we &apos;re not who you think we are .  
<chandler> the agency must have made some mistake .  my wife is not a reverend and i &apos;m not a doctor .  
<s> what ?  
<chandler> i could perform an operation on you and prove it if you &apos;d like .  
<s> so who are you ?  
<chandler> well ,  our names really are monica and chandler .  we &apos;re from new york .  
<monica> yeah ,  but the important thing to know about us ,  is how much we would care for this little baby .   
<s> so you lied to me before ?  
<monica> well ,  we .  .  .    &quot; bore false witness &quot;  .  .  .  see i could be a reverend .  
<s> i can &apos;t believe this .  
<monica> but we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider .  .  .  
<s> giving you my baby ?  you think i &apos;d give you my child after this ?  
<monica> well ,  you don &apos;t have to decide right now ,  but if you could just look at our file .  .  .  
<s> i don &apos;t want to look at your file !  this is over .   
<chandler> erica wait !  
<s> i &apos;ve nothing to say to you .   
<chandler> you have every reason to be upset .  we did lie .  but only because we &apos;ve been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long .  now we don &apos;t know how long it &apos;s gonna be before we can get another chance again .  
<s> why don &apos;t you ask the reverend to pray on it ?  
<chandler> erica ,  please .  just consider us .  ask them to see our file .  our last name &apos;s bing .  my wife &apos;s a chef and i &apos;m in advertising .  
<s> oh yeah .  i actually liked you guys .  but it doesn &apos;t matter ,  because what you did was wrong .   
<chandler> but you did like us .  and you should .  my wife &apos;s an incredible woman .  she &apos;s loving and devoted and caring .  and don &apos;t tell her i said this but the woman &apos;s always right .  .  .  i love my wife more than anything in this world .  and i .  .  .  it kills me that i can &apos;t give her a baby .  .  .  i really want a kid .  and when that day finally comes ,  i &apos;ll learn how to be a good dad .  but my wife .  .  .  she &apos;s already there .  she &apos;s a mother .  .  .  without a baby .  .  .  please ?

<ross> listen ,  listen .  whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you !  now ,  i promise i won &apos;t say a word ,  but if you pick chandler he &apos;s gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time !

<joey>  that was me !  
<chandler> hey ,  can i talk to you about this groomsman thing ?  if you pick ross ,  he &apos;ll walk you down the isle just fine .  but if you choose me ,  you &apos;ll be getting some comedy !  
<rachel> even so ,  i think i &apos;m gonna pick ross .  
<chandler> let me tell you why you need to pick me .   see ,  when i was a kid ,  i was always left out of everything ,  you know ,  and it really made me feel .  .  .  insecure .  you know ,  i was always picked last in gym .  even behind that big fat exchange student who didn &apos;t even know the rules to baseball .  i mean ,  this guy would strike out and then run to third .  anyway ,  if i &apos;m the only one left out of this wedding ,  i just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back .  
<rachel> all right fine ,  i pick you .  
<chandler>  y - y - yeeesss !  make  &quot; groom &quot;  for chandler .

<monica> oh ,  i &apos;m glad .  listen ,  i want to apologize about chandler ,  though .  i just did not see this coming .  
<chandler>  new york is awesome !  
<monica> what is with you ?  
<chandler> yeah ,  i &apos;ve been to these places before ,  but i &apos;ve never really seen them ,  you know .  
<monica> yeah ,  you miss alot ,  when you &apos;re moo - ing .  
<s> thanks so much for showing me around .  
<monica> oh !  it was our pleasure .  we are so much enjoying getting to know you .  
<s> well ,  if there is anything else you wanna know .  .  .   
<chandler> oh ,  uhm ,  okay ,  uhm ,  do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father ?  
<s> oh ,  sure .  yeah ,  well ,  he was my high school boyfriend .  captain of the football team ,  really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college .   
<chandler> that &apos;s great .  
<s> yeah .  .  .  it &apos;s almost definitely him .   
<monica> how &apos;s that now ?  
<s> well ,  there is a chance it &apos;s another guy .  i mean ,  i have only ever been with two guys ,  but they sorta overlapped .  
<chandler> so ,  what does the other guy do ?  does he go to college too ?  
<s> no ,  he &apos;s in prison .   
<monica> was he falsely accused of something ?   
<s> no .  .  .  he killed his father with a shovel .   but other than that ,  he &apos;s a great guy .  
<chandler> i &apos;ll bet his dad doesn &apos;t think so .   
<monica> are you awake ?  
<chandler> of course i &apos;m awake .  assume from now on that i &apos;m always awake !   
<monica> alright ,  we don &apos;t know that it &apos;s him .  i mean ,  it could be the football guy .  
<chandler> honey ,  it &apos;s us .  of course it &apos;s the shovel - killer .  
<monica> alright ,  lets say that it is him ,  would we not want the baby ?  no !  would we treat him any differently ?  
<chandler> i &apos;d keep an eye on him !  we have to find out which one the father is .  
<monica> how ?  
<chandler> i dunno ,  aren &apos;t there tests for these things ,  right ?  
<monica> yeah ,  but maybe we &apos;re just over - reacting .  
<chandler> pff ,  easy for you to say ,  he &apos;s a father killer .  he probably loves him mommy .  he &apos;s probably got a tattoo that says  &quot; mom &quot;  on his shovel - wielding arm !  
<joey> huh ,  un ,  blu ,  bla ,  flu ,  flenk !

<ross> well ,  rachel moving to another country ?  not being able to see her every day .  how can i be okay with this ?  
<monica> i know ,  but what are we gonna do ?  she really needs this job .  
<ross> do you think if the ralph lauren people offered her her old job back ,  she would take it ?  
<monica> how is that gonna happen ?  
<chandler> is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes ?  
<ross> i don &apos;t know .  i could talk to her boss .  yeah !  i met him at that christmas party .  we really hit it off .  
<monica> you mean the guy who kept calling you ron ?  
<ross> i didn &apos;t say we were brothers .  opening credits 
<chandler> we close escrow tomorrow ,  so seeing another house can only confuse us ,  and we &apos;re easily confused .  we &apos;re not very bright .  
<monica> but what if it is better than ours ?  should we at least look ?  
<chandler> what do you think pheebs ?  
<phoebe> well ,  i think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a baskin robbins .  .  .  anyway .  .  .  hey ,  isn &apos;t joey &apos;s agent estelle leonard ?  
<chandler> yeah .  
<phoebe> she died .  
<chandler> you &apos;re kidding !  
<monica> that &apos;s terrible !  
<phoebe> yeah ,  last saturday .  wow !  she was the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic .   oh ,  wait a minute ,  i read the wrong one .  
<chandler> oh yeah ?  
<phoebe> yeah ,  she was just an agent .  
<monica> joey &apos;s gonna be *so* upset .  
<chandler> i know .  *he* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the atlantic .  
<phoebe> well ,  we cannot tell joey about this .  he &apos;s already flipping out about everything that &apos;s changing .  this will push him over the edge .  
<monica> seriously ,  you don &apos;t think we should tell him ?  
<phoebe> well ,  not for a little while .  let &apos;s just give him a few days to get used to everything else .  
<monica> what if he reads it in the paper ?  
<chandler> unless snoopy says it to charlie brown ,  i think we &apos;re okay .  
<ross> yeah ,  i &apos;m a friend of rachel green &apos;s .  uhm ,  actually we met at the christmas party about two years ago .  
<s> oh right ,  uhm ,  don ?  
<ross> close .  ron .   
<s> uh .  .  .  what can i do for you ?  
<ross> uhm ,  well .  .  .  i &apos;m here to see if you &apos;ll give rachel her job back .  
<s> ah ,  did she ask you to come here and do this ?  
<ross> oh ,  no .  at first i have to get you to agree .  then we &apos;ll see if she wants to come back .  
<s> wow ,  that is tempting .  
<ross> look ,  she loved her job here .  and let &apos;s face 
<s> you &apos;re not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it .  isn &apos;t that true ?  
<s> she is good !  
<ross>  huh ,  i took a shot there .  
<s> but i &apos;m sorry .  there &apos;s nothing i can do .  .  .  ah ,  it &apos;s not true ,  there is .  .  .  nothing i want to do .  
<ross> i see .  .  .  thanks very much .   is this your son ?  
<s> yeah ,  his name is ross .   what ?  
<ross> oh ,  nothing ,  its just ,  its close to ron .  does he .  .  does little ross like dinosaurs by any chance ?  
<s> yeah ,  they &apos;re all he talks about ,  why ?  
<ross> how would he like to come with me to the museum of natural history after everyone else has left ,  just the two of us ,  and he can touch anything he wants .   .  i just heard it as you must have heard it and thats not good .  let me start again .  im a paleontologist ,  youll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones fossils !  
<s> you can really arrange that ?  
<ross> you let rachel come back ,  and its done .  
<s> well ,  i guess having rachel back wouldnt be the worst thing in the world .  
<ross> yeah !  yes !  thank you !  this is great .  thank you so much .  and i swear ,  your kid is going to have the time of his life .  
<s> thats great .  i worry about little ross .  hes always reading ,  he &apos;s collecting rocks and hes obsessed with dinosaurs .  
<ross> hell be fine .  
<phoebe> hey .  everything ok ?  
<joey> im just mad at my agent .  
<phoebe> estelle ?  why ?  
<joey> theres a part in a tv movie that i would be perfect for and i didnt even be put up for it !  shed better have a good reason .  
<phoebe> im guessing she does .  
<joey> well  im wanna hear it ,  because she keeps doing this .  
<phoebe> well ,  no ,  no ,  wait ,  wait ,  wait .  all right ,  i gotta go .  just listen .  promise me ,  that you will wait a minute before you call her .  
<joey> ok .  why ?  
<phoebe> because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason .   
<joey> i love that saying !   .  
<joey> hello ?  
<joey> i was just gonna call you !  thats weird .  
<s> its a little coincidental ,  but believable .   .  listen ,  im sure youre wondering why i didnt get you an audition for that tv movie .  
<joey> yeah ,  actually i am !  
<s> i guess i dropped the ball there .  whoopsie !  
<joey> thats it ?  you know ,  it seems all you do lately is drop the ball .  
<s> dont take that tone with me .  who you think you are ?  alan lemond ,  the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic ?  
<joey> no ,  no ,  look .  all im saying is that youre my agent ,  ok ?  and youre not getting me into any auditions and im tired of it .  
<s> what are you saying ?  
<joey> im saying that  .  this isn &apos;t working for me anymore ,  ok ?  estelle ,  youre fired .  goodbye .   .  
<phoebe> man ,  tough week for estelle !  
<rachel> hi .  
<ross> emma left her stuffed t - rex at my house .  you know she cant sleep without it .  
<rachel> oh ,  well ,  shes asleep now .  stop forcing that thing on her .  
<ross> ok .  
<rachel> oh ,  youre not gonna believe what happened to me today !  ralph lauren called ,  and gave me my job back !  
<ross> nooo !  
<rachel> yee .  i mean ,  it was so weirdest thing .  they fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back !  i mean ,  that place must have been falling apart without me .  
<ross> so ,  youre not going to paris .  
<rachel> no ,  im still going .  
<ross> wh whwhat ?  
<rachel> when the louis vuitton people found out that ralph lauren wanted me back ,  the offered me more money !  isnt that great ?  
<ross> yeeeah !   
<s> oh ,  sure .  im showing it to someone else right now ,  but please ,  look around .  
<monica> thanks .  
<chandler> it feels like were cheating on our house .  and if were gonna cheat ,  shouldnt it be with like a hot ,  younger house ,  that does stuff that our house wont do ?  
<monica> ours is so much better !  this living room is smaller ,  the dining room looks like a cave !  what a hole !  
<s> so ?  what do you think ?  
<monica> love it !  
<s> well ,  we already have one offer on it ,  and i think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one .  
<monica> they could be our neighbors ,  what are they like ?  
<s> oh ,  the woman upstairs is very nice .  she and her husband have two kids ,  he &apos;s on wall street and she 
<s> oh my god !   .  
<joey> yeah ,  i just i just feel bad about firing estelle .  this is got to be killing her .  
<phoebe> no ,  that wouldnt kill her .  ordinary embolism might .  
<joey> i dont know .  shes got to be taking it hard ,  i was like her only client .  except for this guy who eats paper .  and im guessing he eats more money than he makes .  look ,  i know shes not a great agent ,  but she did stick with me for ten years .  im gonna call her and hire her again .  
<phoebe> no ,  no ,  no !  don &apos;t call her !  you wait for her to call you  
<joey> why ?  
<phoebe> because patience is the road to understanding  which  .  .  .  is the key .  .  .  to a happy heart .  
<joey>  you blow me away .  
<phoebe>  all right ,  so promise you &apos;re gonna wait for her to call you ?  
<joey> i promise .  and that means ,  never having to give a reason .   
<chandler> and yet i never run into beyonce !  
<s> you two know each other ?  
<s> oh ,  we go way back .  before monica made an honest man out of him ,  chandler used to be my little love muffin !   .  so ?  are you guys thinking of getting this house too ?  ooh !  are we gonna have a bidding war ?  i &apos;d better warn you ,  i &apos;m a toughie  
<chandler>  don &apos;t ,  don &apos;t !   
<monica> no ,  actually ,  we &apos;re buying the house next door .   
<chandler>  why !  ?  
<monica>  i don &apos;t know why .  
<s> ooh ,  that decides it then .  i was on the fence .  but knowing that you two would be our neighbors ?  ah !  now we have to get it !   ellen ,  we &apos;re going to talk numbers .   
<chandler> this can not be happening !  
<monica> okay ,  the realtor said another couple made an offer .  maybe the janice &apos;s won &apos;t get it !  maybe the other couple will .  
<chandler> the only way that that is going to happen ,  is if the other couple are the hitlers .  
<monica>  okay ,  okay ,   all right .  what if we got both houses ?  huh ?  we can turn this house into a guest house .  
<chandler> that is a great idea !  and by the way ,  i don &apos;t mean to sound distasteful ,  but when did you start crapping money !  ?  
<monica> okay ,  you come up with an idea .  
<chandler> alright alright ,  we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house .  we can still get out .  
<monica> but we love our house .  
<chandler> will we love it so much with her next door ?  and she &apos;s gonna be louder out here too .  just the crickets and   &quot; oh my god &quot;  !  
<monica> okay ,  but if we don &apos;t get this house ,  she &apos;s stil gonna show up wherever we go !  i mean ,  at least if she &apos;s here ,  it eliminates the element of suprise .  i mean ,  never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body .   
<chandler>  well ,  we have to do something .  we can &apos;t have her living next door .   oh ,  that does it too .   
<s> this may surprise you ,  but re - hiring fired employees ,  is not my main job .  
<ross> just hear me out .  how would you feel about offering her a raise ?   
<s>  not good ,  ron .  
<ross> perhaps i can persuade you .  what if you can give your son this  genuine pterodactyl egg  replica .  
<s>  wow ,  that &apos;s pretty cool  
<ross> huh ?  so ?  we have a deal ?  
<s> okay ,  you got it .  
<ross> yes !  yes !  
<s> this is gonna make me very popular .  
<ross> oh ,   believe me ,  the ladies ,  they love it !  
<s>  i meant with my son .  
<ross> good ,   &apos;cause the ladies ,  not so much .   
<joey> oh my god .   hello ?  
<phoebe>  joey ,  it &apos;s estelle .   
<joey> estelle ?

<s> all right ,  i got to run .  tell monica i say goodbye .  and .  .  .  i &apos;ll see you later ,  neighbor .   
<chandler> wait !  i just want you to know that .  .  .  i &apos;m so happy you &apos;re going to be here .

<ross> no ,  i don &apos;t think so .  
<phoebe> you know ,  maybe she was just really spent from our talk .  it was pretty intense .  
<monica> yeah .  mine too .  
<chandler> mine was a humdinger 
<ross>  o - kay .  .  .  i mean ,  don &apos;t i deserve anything ?  i mean ,  a few tears ,  a cursory hug ?   not from you !

<monica> and say what ?   &quot; you owe me a goodbye &quot;  ,  i mean ,  he &apos;s got more pride than that .  
<ross> the hell i do !
