they do not ! 
they do to ! 
i hope so . 
she okay ? 
let &apos;s go . 
wow
okay  -  -  you &apos;re gonna need to learn how to lie . 
no
i &apos;m kidding .   you know how sometimes you just become this  &quot; persona &quot;  ?   and you don &apos;t know how to quit ? 
like my fear of wearing pastels ? 
the  &quot; real you &quot;  . 
what good stuff ? 
i figured you &apos;d get to the good stuff eventually . 
thank god !   if i had to hear one more story about your coiffure .  .  . 
me .   this endless  .  .  . blonde babble .  i &apos;m like ,  boring myself . 
what crap ? 
do you listen to this crap ? 
no .  .  . 
then guillermo says ,   &quot; if you go any lighter ,  you &apos;re gonna look like an extra on 90210 .  &quot; 
you always been this selfish ? 
but
then that &apos;s all you had to say . 
well ,  no .  .  . 
you never wanted to go out with  &apos;me ,  did you ? 
i was ? 
i looked for you back at the party ,  but you always seemed to be  &quot; occupied &quot;  . 
tons
have fun tonight ? 
i believe we share an art instructor
you know chastity ? 
looks like things worked out tonight ,  huh ? 
hi . 
who knows ?   all i &apos;ve ever heard her say is that she &apos;d dip before dating a guy that smokes . 
so that &apos;s the kind of guy she likes ?  pretty ones ? 
lesbian ?   no .  i found a picture of jared leto in one of her drawers ,  so i &apos;m pretty sure she &apos;s not harboring same - sex tendencies . 
she &apos;s not a .  .  . 
i &apos;m workin &apos; on it .  but she doesn &apos;t seem to be goin &apos; for him . 
i really ,  really ,  really wanna go ,  but i can &apos;t .   not unless my sister goes . 
sure have . 
eber &apos;s deep conditioner every two days .  and i never ,  ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment . 
how do you get your hair to look like that ? 
you &apos;re sweet . 
you have my word .   as a gentleman
i counted on you to help my cause .  you and that thug are obviously failing .  aren &apos;t we ever going on our date ? 
you got something on your mind ? 
where ? 
there . 
well ,  there &apos;s someone i think might be  -  - 
how is our little find the wench a date plan progressing ? 
forget french . 
that &apos;s because it &apos;s such a nice one . 
i don &apos;t want to know how to say that though .   i want to know useful things .  like where the good stores are .   how much does champagne cost ?   stuff like chat .   i have never in my life had to point out my head to someone . 
right .   see ?   you &apos;re ready for the quiz . 
c &apos;esc ma tete .  this is my head
let me see what i can do . 
gosh ,  if only we could find kat a boyfriend .  .  . 
that &apos;s a shame . 
unsolved mystery .   she used to be really popular when she started high school ,  then it was just like she got sick of it or something . 
why ? 
seems like she could get a date easy enough .  .  . 
the thing is ,  cameron  -  -  i &apos;m at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser .   my sister .   i can &apos;t date until she does . 
cameron . 
no ,  no ,  it &apos;s my fault  -  -  we didn &apos;t have a proper introduction  -  -  - 
forget it . 
you &apos;re asking me out .   that &apos;s so cute .  what &apos;s your name again ? 
okay .  .  .  then how  &apos;bout we try out some french cuisine .   saturday ?   night ? 
not the hacking and gagging and spitting part .   please . 
well ,  i thought we &apos;d start with pronunciation ,  if that &apos;s okay with you . 
can we make this quick ?   roxanne korrine and andrew barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break -  up on the quad .   again . 
i did . 
you think you  &apos; re the only sophomore at the prom ? 
i don &apos;t have to be home  &apos;til two . 
i have to be home in twenty minutes . 
all i know is  -  -  i &apos;d give up my private line to go out with a guy like joey . 
sometimes i wonder if the guys we &apos;re supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with ,  you know ? 
bianca ,  i don &apos;t think the highlights of dating joey dorsey are going to include door - opening and coat - holding . 
combination .   i don &apos;t know  -  -  i thought he &apos;d be different .   more of a gentleman .  .  . 
is he oily or dry ? 
he practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist .  i mean .  dr .  bonchowski is great an all ,  but he &apos;s not exactly relevant party conversation . 
would you mind getting me a drink ,  cameron ? 
great
joey . 
who ? 
where did he go ?   he was just here . 
you might wanna think about it
no . 
did you change your hair ? 
you know the deal .   i can  &apos; t go if kat doesn &apos;t go  -  - 
listen ,  i want to talk to you about the prom . 
you &apos;re concentrating awfully hard considering it &apos;s gym class . 
hi ,  joey . 
hey ,  sweet cheeks . 
my agent says i &apos;ve got a good shot at being the prada guy next year . 
neat .  .  . 
it &apos;s a gay cruise line ,  but i &apos;ll be ,  like ,  wearing a uniform and stuff . 
queen harry ? 
so yeah ,  i &apos;ve got the sears catalog thing going  -  -  and the tube sock gig  &quot;  that &apos;s gonna be huge .   and then i &apos;m up for an ad for queen harry next week . 
hopefully . 
exactly  so ,  you going to bogey lowenbrau &apos;s thing on saturday ? 
expensive ? 
it &apos;s more
perm ? 
patrick  -  -  is that -  a . 
it &apos;s just you . 
is that woman a complete fruit - loop or is it just me ? 
no !  i just wanted
what ?  to completely damage me ?   to send me to therapy forever ?  what ? 
i just wanted  -  - 
you set me up . 
let go ! 
so did you
you looked beautiful last night ,  you know . 
i guess i &apos;ll never know ,  will i ? 
not all experiences are good ,  bianca .  you can &apos;t always trust the people you want to . 
god ,  you &apos;re just like him !  just keep me locked away in the dark ,  so i can &apos;t experience anything for myself
i guess i thought i was protecting you . 
i &apos;m not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes . 
that &apos;s not
no .  you didn &apos;t !   if you really thought i could make my own decisions ,  you would &apos;ve let me go out with him instead of helping daddy hold me hostage . 
i wanted to let you make up your own mind about him . 
why didn &apos;t you tell me ? 
after that ,  i swore i &apos;d never do anything just because  &quot; everyone else &quot;  was doing it .   and i haven &apos;t since .  except for bogey &apos;s party ,  and my stunning gastro - intestinal display  -  - 
but
just once .   afterwards ,  i told him i didn &apos;t want to anymore .   i wasn &apos;t ready .  he got pissed .   then he broke up with me . 
you did what ? 
he said everyone was doing it .   so i did it . 
as in .  .  . 
now i do .   back then ,  was a different story . 
but you hate joey
he was ,  like ,  a total babe
why ? 
in 9th .   for a month
what ? 
joey never told you we went out ,  did he ? 
i wish i had that luxury .  i &apos;m the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and i can &apos;t go ,  because you won  &apos; t . 
i do care .  but i &apos;m a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons ,  not someone else  &apos; s  . 
like you care . 
listen ,  i know you hate having to sit home because i &apos;m not susie high school . 
you &apos;re welcome . 
i don &apos;t get you .   you act like you &apos;re too good for any of this ,  and then you go totally apeshit when you get here . 
i really don &apos;t think i need any social advice from you right now . 
bianca ,  i need to talk to you  -  -  i need to tell you  -  - 
can we go now ? 
you are so completely unbalanced . 
yeah ,  he &apos;s your freak friend mandella &apos;s boyfriend .   i guess since i &apos;m not allowed to go out ,  i should obsess over a dead guy ,  too . 
it &apos;s shakespeare .   maybe you &apos;ve heard of him ? 
like i &apos;m supposed to know what that even means . 
at least i &apos;m not a clouted fen -  sucked hedge - pig . 
can &apos;t you forget for just one night that you &apos;re completely wretched ? 
bogey lowenstein &apos;s party is normal ,  but you &apos;re too busy listening to bitches who need prozac to know that . 
what &apos;s normal ? 
you &apos;re ruining my life &apos;  because you won &apos;t be normal ,  i can &apos;t be normal . 
i think you &apos;re a freak .   i think you do this to torture me .   and i think you suck . 
what do you think ? 
oh ,  i thought you might have a date  i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m bothering to ask ,  but are you going to bogey lowenstein &apos;s party saturday night ? 
it means that gigglepuss is playing at club skunk and we &apos;re going . 
oh my god ,  does this mean you &apos;re becoming normal ? 
can you at least start wearing a bra ? 
i have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don &apos;t get out of my way . 
nowhere .  .  .  hi ,  daddy . 
where &apos;ve you been ? 
i have a date ,  daddy .   and he  &apos; s not a captain of oppression like some men we know . 
i &apos;m missing something . 
fine .   i see that i &apos;m a prisoner in my own house .   i &apos;m not a daughter .  i &apos;m a possession ! 
you &apos;re not going unless your sister goes .   end of story . 
he &apos;s not a  &quot; hot rod &quot;  .   whatever that is . 
it &apos;s that hot rod joey ,  right ?  that  &apos; s who you want me to bend my rules for ? 
no ,  but
the prom ?   kat has a date ? 
daddy ,  i want to discuss the prom with you .  it &apos;s tomorrow night  -  - 
because she &apos;ll scare them away . 
why ? 
promise me you won &apos;t talk to any boys unless your sister is present . 
just for a minute
daddy ,  no ! 
wear the belly before you go . 
it &apos;s just a party .  daddy . 
oh ,  god .   it &apos;s starting . 
if kat &apos;s not going ,  you &apos;re not going . 
daddy ,  people expect me to be there ! 
it &apos;s just a party .  daddy ,  but i knew you &apos;d forbid me to go since  &quot; gloria steinem &quot;  over there isn &apos;t going  -  - 
otherwise known as an orgy ? 
if you must know ,  we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends . 
and where &apos;re you going ? 
daddy ,  i  -  - 
exactly my point
but she doesn &apos;t want to date . 
but it &apos;s not fair  -  -  she &apos;s a mutant ,  daddy ! 
then neither will you .   and i &apos;ll get to sleep at night . 
what if she never starts dating ? 
no !  you &apos;re not dating until your sister starts dating .   end of discussion . 
now don &apos;t get upset .  daddy ,  but there &apos;s this boy .  .  .  and i think he might ask .  .  . 
just sent  &apos;em through . 
padua girls .   one tall ,  decent body .  the other one kinda short and undersexed ? 
never
fan of a fan .   you see a couple of minors come in ? 
didn &apos;t have you pegged for a gigglepuss fan .   aren &apos;t they a little too pre - teen belly - button ring for you ? 
always a pleasure ,  brucie . 
best case scenario ,  you &apos;re back on the payroll for awhile . 
you humiliated the woman !  sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score . 
no ,  i  &apos; m not . 
buttholus extremus .   but hey ,  you &apos;re making progress . 
the hell is that ?   what kind of  &apos;guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you &apos;re talking to her ? 
extremely unfortunate maneuver . 
hell ,  i &apos;ve just been going over the whole thing in my head and  - 
you told me that part already . 
it &apos;s her favorite band . 
assail your ears for one night . 
okay !   i wasn &apos;t sure
he &apos;s pretty ! 
dead at forty - one . 
her favorite uncle
it &apos;s a lung cancer issue
number one .   she hates smokers
are you kidding ?   he &apos;ll piss himself with joy .   he &apos;s the ultimate kiss ass . 
will bogey get bent ? 
in that case ,  we &apos;ll need to make it a school - wide blow out . 
this is it .   a golden opportunity .  patrick can ask katarina to the party . 
like we had a choice ?   besides  -  -  when you let the enemy think he &apos;s orchestrating the battle ,  you &apos;re in a position of power .  we let him pretend he &apos;s calling the shots ,  and while he &apos;s busy setting up the plan ,  you have time to woo bianca . 
you got him involved ? 
hey  -  -  i &apos;ve gotta have a few clients when i get to wall street . 
i thought you hated those people . 
you know ,  if you do go out with bianca ,  you &apos;d be set .   you &apos;d outrank everyone .  strictly a - list .   with me by your side . 
that &apos;s what i just said
did she actually say she &apos;d go out with you ? 
forget his reputation .   do you think we &apos;ve got a plan or not ? 
i &apos;m serious ,  man ,  he &apos;s whacked .   he sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers . 
they always let felons sit in on honors biology ? 
no kidding .   he &apos;s a criminal .   i heard he lit a state trooper on fire .   he just got out of alcatraz .  .  . 
he seems like he thrives on danger
what makes you think he &apos;ll do it ? 
you wanna go out with him ? 
what about him ? 
unlikely ,  but even so ,  she still can &apos;t go out with you .   so what &apos;s the point ? 
i teach her french ,  get to know her ,  dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me . 
the mewling ,  rampalian wretch herself . 
that &apos;s her ?   bianca &apos;s sister ? 
yeah ,  just a minor encounter with the shrew . 
you could consecrate with her ,  my friend . 
you mean i &apos;d get a chance to talk to her ? 
guess who just signed up for a tutor ? 
sure do  .  .  .  my mom &apos;s from canada
you know french ? 
joey dorsey ?   perma - shit - grin .   i wish i could say he &apos;s a moron ,  but he &apos;s number twelve in the class .   and a model .   mostly regional stuff ,  but he &apos;s rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out . 
he always have that shit - eating grin ? 
because they &apos;re bred to .   their mothers liked guys like that ,  and their grandmothers before them .  their gene pool is rarely diluted . 
why do girls like that always like guys like that ? 
i could start with your haircut ,  but it doesn &apos;t matter .   she &apos;s not allowed to date until her older sister does .   and that &apos;s an impossibility . 
why not ? 
bianca stratford .   sophomore .  don &apos;t even think about it
who is she ? 
you burn ,  you pine ,  you perish ? 
that girl  -  -  i  -  - 
yeah ,  but these guys have never seen a horse .   they just jack off to clint eastwood . 
that i &apos;m used to . 
couple thousand .  most of them evil
how many people go here ? 
get out ! 
thirty - two . 
how many people were in your old school ? 
yeah .   a couple .   we &apos;re outnumbered by the cows ,  though . 
i was kidding .  people actually live there ? 
north ,  actually .   how &apos;d you    ? 
so  -  -  which dakota you from ? 
c &apos;mon .   i &apos;m supposed to give you the tour . 
so they tell me .  .  . 
you the new guy ? 
you get the girl . 
what &apos;s the worst ? 
where ? 
she kissed me . 
you makin &apos; any headway ? 
she just needs time to cool off i &apos;ll give it a day . 
she hates you with the fire of a thousand suns  .   that &apos;s a direct quote
i don  &apos; t know .   i decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it . 
what &apos;d you do to her ? 
then ,  go get her
sure
cameron  -  -  do you like the girl ? 
she &apos;s partial to joey ,  not me
what  &apos;re you talking about ? 
it &apos;s off .  the whole thing . 
cameron ,  i &apos;m a little busy
don &apos;t make me do it ,  man
gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night . 
so what does that give me ?   i &apos;m supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can &apos;t play their instruments ? 
okay  -  -  likes :   thai food ,  feminist prose ,  and  &quot; angry ,  stinky girl music of the indie - rock persuasion &quot;  . 
i &apos;ve retrieved certain pieces of information on miss katarina stratford i think you &apos;ll find helpful . 
what &apos;ve you got for me ? 
yeah  -  -  we &apos;ll see . 
and he means that strictly in a non -  prison - movie type of way . 
and why would i do that ? 
leave my sister alone . 
your sister here ? 
away . 
where ya goin ? 
not at all
hey  -  -  do you mind ? 
they &apos;re running the rest of me next month . 
yeah ,  and i noticed the only part of you featured in your big kmart spread was your elbow .   tough break . 
the vintage look is over ,  kat .  haven &apos;t you been reading your sassy ? 
enough with the barbie n &apos; ken shit .  i know . 
i don &apos;t know ,  dorsey .   .  . the limo .  - the flowers .   another hundred for the tux  -  - 
get her to act like a human
do what ? 
how &apos;d you do it ? 
a deal &apos;s a deal . 
it &apos;s about time . 
forget her sister ,  then . 
forget it . 
a hundred bucks a date . 
what ? 
i just upped my price
i got her under control .  she just acts crazed in public to keep up the image . 
watching the bitch trash my car doesn &apos;t count as a date . 
i &apos;m on it
when i shell out fifty ,  i expect results . 
fifty ,  and you &apos;ve got your man . 
take it or leave it .   this isn &apos;t a negotiation . 
fine ,  thirty . 
i can &apos;t take a girl like that out on twenty bucks . 
how much ? 
i can &apos;t date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend .   and that &apos;s the catch .  she doesn &apos;t want a boyfriend . 
you &apos;re gonna pay me to take out some girl ? 
you got it ,  verona .   i pick up the tab ,  you do the honors . 
but you &apos;d go out with her if you had the cake ? 
you need money to take a girl out
you just said
sure ,  sparky .   i &apos;ll get right on it . 
yeah ,  whatever .   i want you to go out with her . 
two legs ,  nice rack .  .  . 
what do you think ? 
yeah
hey  -  -  it &apos;s all for the higher good right ? 
you better not fuck this up .   i &apos;m heavily invested . 
what ?   we took bathes together when we were kids . 
you and verona ? 
uh ,   yeah .   we &apos;re old friend*
i hear you &apos;re helpin &apos; verona . 
so what you need to do is recruit a guy who &apos;ll go out with her .   someone who &apos;s up for the job . 
does this conversation have a purpose ? 
but she can &apos;t go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her .  right ? 
we &apos;re not . 
well ,  actually ,  i thought i &apos;d run an idea by you .   you know ,  just to see if you &apos;re interested . 
we don &apos;t chat . 
nope  -  just came by to chat
are you lost ? 
hey . 
oh ,  honey  -  -  tell me we haven &apos;t &apos; progressed to full - on hallucinations . 
william  -  he asked me to meet him here . 
who ? 
have you seen him ? 
oh ,  good .   something new and different for us . 
you  &apos; re looking at this from the wrong perspective .   we &apos;re making a statement . 
okay ,  okay ,  we won &apos;t go .   it &apos;s not like i have a dress anyway
listen to you !   you sound like betty ,  all pissed off because archie is taking veronica . 
well ,  i guess we &apos;re not ,  since we don &apos;t have dates  . 
can you even imagine ?   who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess ? 
i got drunk .   i puked .   i got rejected .  it was big fun . 
you didn &apos;t
i did bianca a favor and it backfired . 
you didn &apos;t have a choice ?   where &apos;s kat and what have you done with her ? 
i didn &apos;t have a choice . 
you went to the party ?   i thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity . 
who cares ? 
what &apos;d he say ? 
no fear . 
you think this &apos;ll work ? 
if i was bianca ,  it would be ,   &quot; any school you want ,  precious .   don &apos;t forget your tiara .  &quot; 
does it matter ? 
i appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death ,  but i &apos;m consuming .   do you mind ? 
neither has his heterosexuality . 
that &apos;s never been proven
william didn &apos;t even go to high school
william would never have gone to a state school . 
so he has this huge raging fit about sarah lawrence and insists that i go to his male - dominated ,  puking frat boy ,  number one golf team school .  i have no say at all . 
you could always go with me .   i &apos;m sure william has some friends . 
the people at this school are so incredibly foul . 
but imagine the things he &apos;d say during sex . 
i realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking ,  but killing yourself so you can be with william shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions .   you &apos;re venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy . 
an attempted slit . 
what &apos;s this ? 
just a little . 
mandella ,  eat .   starving yourself is a very slow way to die . 
block e ? 
he always look so
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s completely incapable of doing anything that interesting . 
that &apos;s pat verona ?  the one who was gone for a year ?  i heard he was doing porn movies . 
patrick verona   random skid . 
who &apos;s that ? 
don  &apos; t you even dare .   .   . 
oh ,  bianca ?   can you get me my freshman yearbook ? 
because i like to torture you . 
why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill ? 
yeah ,  but then i fucked up .  i fell for her . 
is that right ? 
besides ,  i had some extra cash .  some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl . 
i thought you could use it .  when you start your band . 
a fender strat .  you bought this ? 
i didn &apos;t care about the money . 
really ?   what was it like ?   a down payment now ,  then a bonus for sleeping with me ? 
it wasn &apos;t like that . 
you were paid to take me out !   by  -  -  the one person i truly hate .   i knew it was a set - up ! 
wait i .  .  . 
it gets worse  -  -  you still have your freshman yearbook ? 
that  &apos; s completely adorable ! 
that &apos;s where i was last year .   she &apos;d never lived alone  -  -  my grandfather died  -  -  i stayed with her .   i wasn &apos;t in jail ,  i don &apos;t know marilyn manson ,  and i &apos;ve never slept with a spice girl .   i spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching wheel of fortune .   end of story . 
what ? 
my grandmother &apos;s  . 
look ,  i &apos;m   -  -  sorry  -  -  that i questioned your motives .   i was wrong . 
oh huh
it &apos;s just something i had .   you know
it &apos;s scurvy &apos;s .   his date got convicted .  where &apos;d you get the dress ? 
how &apos;d you get a tux at the last minute ? 
nothing !   there &apos;s nothing in it for me .  just the pleasure of your company . 
answer the question ,  patrick
you need therapy .   has anyone ever told you that ? 
you tell me . 
so i have to have a motive to be with you ? 
create a little drama ?   start a new rumor ?   what ? 
because i don &apos;t want to .  it &apos;s a stupid tradition . 
why not ? 
no ,  i won &apos;t go with you
no what ? 
no . 
you know what i mean
is that a request or a command ? 
go to the prom with me
you &apos;re amazingly self - assured .  has anyone ever told you that ? 
no one else knows
what ? 
you &apos;re sweet .   and sexy .   and completely hot for me . 
no  -  -  something real .   something no one else knows . 
i hate peas . 
tell me something true . 
i know the porn career &apos;s a lie . 
hearsay . 
the duck ? 
fallacy . 
state trooper ? 
for .   .   .   ? 
you up for it ? 
you never disappointed me . 
how ? 
then you screwed up
something like that
so if you disappoint them from the start ,  you &apos;re covered ? 
i don &apos;t like to do what people expect .  then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change . 
yes
acting the way we do . 
so what &apos;s your excuse ? 
yeah ,  well ,  don &apos;t let it get out
a soft side ?  who knew ? 
i dazzled him with my wit
so how &apos;d you get chapin to look the other way ? 
good call . 
i figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect .   and piss you off . 
the partridge family ? 
maybe . 
you want me to climb up and show you how to get down ? 
forget it .   i &apos;m stayin &apos; . 
put your right foot there  -  - 
try lookin &apos; at it from this angle
c &apos;mon .   it &apos;s not that bad
i guess i never told you i &apos;m afraid of heights . 
look up ,  sunshine
he left !   i sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me .
