so that &apos;s the kind of guy she likes ?  pretty ones ? 
you know chastity ? 
i looked for you back at the party ,  but you always seemed to be  &quot; occupied &quot;  . 
i &apos;m kidding .   you know how sometimes you just become this  &quot; persona &quot;  ?   and you don &apos;t know how to quit ? 
wow
so yeah ,  i &apos;ve got the sears catalog thing going  -  -  and the tube sock gig  &quot;  that &apos;s gonna be huge .   and then i &apos;m up for an ad for queen harry next week . 
you &apos;re ruining my life &apos;  because you won &apos;t be normal ,  i can &apos;t be normal . 
but
i guess i thought i was protecting you . 
daddy ,  i  -  - 
he &apos;s not a  &quot; hot rod &quot;  .   whatever that is . 
so  -  -  which dakota you from ? 
how many people were in your old school ?

he always have that shit - eating grin ? 
yeah ,  just a minor encounter with the shrew . 
i teach her french ,  get to know her ,  dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me . 
what makes you think he &apos;ll do it ? 
no kidding .   he &apos;s a criminal .   i heard he lit a state trooper on fire .   he just got out of alcatraz .  .  . 
assail your ears for one night . 
you told me that part already . 
the vintage look is over ,  kat .  haven &apos;t you been reading your sassy ? 
hey  -  -  do you mind ? 
where ya goin ? 
sure ,  sparky .   i &apos;ll get right on it . 
you got it ,  verona .   i pick up the tab ,  you do the honors . 
i can &apos;t date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend .   and that &apos;s the catch .  she doesn &apos;t want a boyfriend . 
i can &apos;t take a girl like that out on twenty bucks . 
when i shell out fifty ,  i expect results . 
hey . 
i hear you &apos;re helpin &apos; verona . 
that &apos;s pat verona ?  the one who was gone for a year ?  i heard he was doing porn movies . 
you went to the party ?   i thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity . 
you  &apos; re looking at this from the wrong perspective .   we &apos;re making a statement . 
have you seen him ? 
pick you up friday ,  then
dorsey . 
i thought you were above all that
kat !  wake up ! 
and i &apos;m in control of it . 
were you in jail ? 
wholesome . 
so what did i have an effect on  ? 
you want me to climb up and show you how to get down ? 
good call . 
so if you disappoint them from the start ,  you &apos;re covered ? 
then you screwed up
you up for it ? 
tell me something true . 
it wasn &apos;t like that . 
this from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips ? 
you know ,  fathers don &apos;t like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives .   it means we &apos;ve become spectators .   bianca still lets me play a few innings .   you &apos;ve had me on the bleachers for years .   when you go to sarah lawrence ,  i won &apos;t even be able to watch the game . 
tempestuous ? 
hey there .   tired of breathing ? 
say it
are you telling me i &apos;m a  -    &quot; non - smoker &quot;  ? 
it was a bratwurst .   i was eating lunch . 
in the microwave . 
have a great time ,  honey ! 
if god intended our proximity to asia ,  do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world ? 
are we going to argue ? 
they took everything .  .  . 
don alonso de bobadilla . 
how are you feeling ,  fernando ? 
i want you to tell me everything you remember ,  father .   from the beginning .   everything . 
no .  .  . 
to bring the word of god . 
how can you be so certain ?   the ocean is said to be infinite . 
father marchena ! 
in nomine patris et filius ,  et spiritus sancti . 
new worlds create new people . 
do they have such thoughts ? 
but without your brothers .   nor are you to return to santo domingo or any of the other colonies .   you may explore the continent . 
in one act of brutality ,  you have created chaos .   tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us !   all that because of your criminal savagery ! 
we &apos;re on the verge of a mutiny ,  colon ! 
 .  .  .  into a monk .  .  . 
then ,  what do you suggest ,  don sanchez ? 
i brought you some letters .   it &apos;s really fan mail .   women mostly .   one wants to buy you clothes ,  another sent a check .  another wants a check . 
tell me about yourself .   what you did as a young boy .  .  .  what your parents were like . 
your mother was blind ? 
i can &apos;t take you to my place . 
i came here .   i had no money .   i knew no one .   i couldn &apos;t get a job because you have to have a green card to get work .  they approached me  -  i could &apos;ve made a lot of money .   i considered it ,  but .  .  .  it &apos;s not who i am .   they pay me below the table at ludwig &apos;s . 
oh yeah .  .  .  ?   alright . 
forgot ?   you handcuffed a civilian to a tree ?  ! 
alright .   swing by her apartment .   let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to hoover street .   you got that ? 
he got my gun !   motherfucker was filming the whole time ! 
tall ,  short - haired ,  scary eyes .   second guy with him was .  .  . shorter ,  with a wrestler &apos;s build .   and he wouldn &apos;t turn his videocamera off me . 
it &apos;s your crime scene now .   you can do what you want . 
maybe it &apos;s a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message .   burial rites are taken very seriously in eastern europe .   it could be to humiliate them .  just burning them up ,  no proper funeral ,  it &apos;s like condemning them to hell . 
i &apos;ll let you know what happens . 
two heads . 
leon  -  meet us at 63rd and madison .  hair salon .   ludwig &apos;s . 
c &apos;mon .   you intimidate her  &apos;cause you &apos;re a celebrity .   she sees me differently . 
yeah ,  just her in the shower .   nothing happened .   look ,  i &apos;m sure you probably think i &apos;m a fool and i fucked up ,  but .  .  . 
but ,  i mean ,  didn &apos;t you ever go out on a limb for somebody ?   i mean ,  you shoulda heard her there .   tellin &apos; her whole story .  .  . i believed her . 
can we go up to the crime scene ? 
do you have the suspect in custody ? 
hey ,  honey . 
you didn &apos;t have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues .   you could give me something . 
stop it . 
that was good .   you were holding the evidence . 
oh my g - d ,  they want me to anchor .   they want me to anchor tonight ! 
are you married ? 
what is your intended purpose of your visit to the united states ? 
don &apos;t fool around . 
i &apos;m serious .  .  . this  -  this is a great american film .   full of violence and sex .   and i want my credit . 
emil ?  ?  ?  ! 
your sister said she didn &apos;t know where you were so you shouldn &apos;t write to her with return address if you &apos;re hiding . 
yes ,  the money is good . 
isn &apos;t he a little moody ? 
i &apos;ll send a cop back for you . 
i don &apos;t know ,  you think eddie will give me his autograph ? 
the smoke &apos;ll permeate your nostrils  -  burn  &apos;em out .   let it run . 
you see eddie &apos;s face when i gave him the timer ?   wish i had a picture of it . 
 -  -  from czechoslovakia ?   and how long have they been livin &apos; in your building ?   alright ,  i &apos;ll be in touch when we know somethin &apos; .   milos and tamina karlova .   they were quiet and kept to themselves .   landlord don &apos;t know who your girl is . 
look ,  i &apos;m in here .   you call this a career move ?

continued
it &apos;s about my salary cheques . 
not really .  they just said it might be because we trained at houston and they trained in marshall ,  and that we &apos;re being charged against differ -  ent accounting offices . 
i guess not . 
well ,  don &apos;t worry about it . 
repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation . 
if you &apos;re determined to revive the crew now ,  i can handle the whole thing myself .  there &apos;s no need for you to trouble . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  dave ,  but in accordance with sub - routine c1532 / 4 ,  quote ,  when the crew are dead or incapacitated ,  the computer must assume control ,  unquote .  i must ,  therefore ,  override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel -  ligently exercise it .

coninued
 &apos;bye ,   &apos;bye ,  now ,  sweetheart .

well ,  i &apos;ll tell you why i ask .  you see ,  i &apos;ve got a girl who works in the auditing department of the territorial administrator and i haven &apos;t been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so ,  and with all these stories one hears ,  i &apos;m a little concerned about her . 
right .  hal ,  tell me whether the following statements are true or false . 
that &apos;s true . 
five by five ,  frank . 
yeah ?

this part of town ,  they &apos;ll make us for heat the second we walk in .  just back me up like you &apos;ve got a piece .  .  . 
i been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers .  all those clowns ever had going for  &apos;em was a gun and a badge .  .  . 
you tell me what ganz busted out for ,  he &apos;s after a lot more than just gettin &apos; out of jail .   and whatever it is ,  you &apos;re part of it . 
this place don &apos;t seem real popular with the brothers . 
there . 
let &apos;s go . 
you ?   don &apos;t make me laugh .   you can &apos;t take care of shit .   you &apos;ve been dicking me around since we started on this turd - hunt .   all you &apos;re good for is games .  .  .  so far ,  what i got outta you is nothin &apos; .  .  . 
they saved your ass ,  convict . 
you son of a bitch .  you knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait .  i almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing . 
you took a big chance ,  leaving this here all this time . 
i suppose you &apos;d never be like luther and let a woman get to you .  .  . 
maybe luther hopes ganz &apos;ll give him a piece of your money .  .  . 
what about luther ? 
tell me something .   why didn &apos;t you just take the money off luther and split ? 
back to jail in my own car .   ganz got away .  got all my money .  it just don &apos;t seem right . 
yeah ,  well the only woman of the indian &apos;s we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend .   i guess she went with him before she came outta the closet  .  .  .  they both looked mad enough to kill him .  .  . 
hey ,  there she is .  .  . 
if we run into billy first ,  let me try and talk him in . 
it &apos;s your money .   it &apos;ll be here in six months when you get out . 
hey ,  the bastard &apos;s got my gun .   i want it back . 
being a hot dog &apos;s worked pretty well for me so far .  .  .  besides ,  i got a lead .  .  . 
don &apos;t duck the bullet cates .  why didn &apos;t you call in for backup instead of makin &apos; a grandstand play ? 
i think i wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking .   can we find them ? 
bullshit red tape . 
jesus christ .   why the hell didn &apos;t you tell me before ? 
what am i wanted for ?

a guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today . 
no wonder you &apos;re so popular . 
hey ,  i don &apos;t believe it . 
you real down ? 
i &apos;m not so sure i can say the same thing .  .  . you don &apos;t look like a cop . 
instead of worryin &apos; about reggie ,  you better worry about me .  .  . 
five .   on credit . 
the case .  . with the stones .  .  .  where is it ? 
personally ,  they are of no interest to me ,  i &apos;d rather sell weapons .  . but i have a customer .  .  .  so tell me .  .  . 
you are a monster ,  zorg ! 
she &apos;s not my bride ,  she &apos;s my fare .  she &apos;s looking for this vito cornelius .  according to the phone guide he lives here . 
he &apos;s a she ! 
there &apos;s not a moment to lose !  wake her up ,  but be gentle about it !   this woman is mankind &apos;s most precious possession !  she is .  .  .  perfect ! 
they all like this in your family ,  father ? 
excuse me !  just one thing !   she said something to me a while ago and .  .  .  i don &apos;t really get it .  .  .  akta gamat ? 
leeloo &apos;s in trouble ? 
your theory is interesting father but i don &apos;t think we have time to go into it right now ! 
but what happens if instead of this .  .  .  ultimate warrior .  .  .  it is evil who stands here ? 
did you see that .  . thing .  . swallow our battleship like a gum drop ?   you can &apos;t even tell me what it is !  i ask you for options you give me bullshit .  give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards . 
there was this guy with a limp who came a month ago .  . said he was an art dealer  .  .  .  asking all these questions about the sacred stones .  . at the time i didn &apos;t think anything of it .  .  what was his name ?  i &apos;m so bad with names .  .  . 
they really made her .  .  . 
i got it !   everything  here we need to know about fhloston paradise hotel .  .  .  and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel ! 
i &apos;m sorry ,  but .  .  .  the stones .  .  .

welcome on board mr .  dallas .  .

don &apos;t you open your messages ? 
i &apos;m not going . 
 .  .  . shit ! 
apipoulai ! 
here we go again .  .  . 
i told you i need to work in peace .  remember ?  i need to concentrate . 
five hundred wars .  .  .  arms .  .  .  drugs .  .  .  money .  .  .  everything you create is used to destroy .  .  . 
i know all that ,  leeloo !  i &apos;m talking about the stones . 
it &apos;s up to you now ,  angel ! 
what &apos;s the use of saving lives .  .  .  when you see what you do with them ! 
how someone strong like you scared from a message ?  is good news i sure ! 
isn &apos;t that a z140 ?  alleviated titanium .  neuro charged assault model ? 
this is all that survived ? 
 .  .  . this is the crucial phase ,  the reconstruction of pigment .  cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react ,  to protect themselves .  that means growing skin .  clever ,  eh ? 
this thing solid ? 
i managed to contact the mondoshawan .  they deplore the incident ,  but accept our apologies . 
drink ! 
how &apos;s that ?  can you hear me better now ? 
dispatch me another zfx200 immediately .  someone stole mine . 
how &apos;s our deal coming along ? 
i &apos;m not accusing you .  .  . 
you think you &apos;ll have time for the water heater this weekend ? 
it &apos;s a missing persons case .  .  .  a long shot .   i &apos;ll give it two months ,  two months at most ,  then i &apos;ll be back .   we &apos;ll take a vacation . 
why haven &apos;t you called ?   why don &apos;t you answer your phone ? 
no ,  i don &apos;t ,  because you &apos;re not telling me anything ! 
what are these ? 
there &apos;s nothing there ,  you brain -  dead cunt .   think about it .   there &apos;s absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything .   i want you to hang the phone up ,  and if you call me about this again i &apos;m going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader . 
you said something about money . 
for whatever reasons i thought you might be more receptive . 
who is this . 
what do you want to know ?   you saw it ,  you saw the loop .  .  . 
you can &apos;t go to the cops .   all you can do is cut me loose and walk away ,  because you got nothing .  .  . 
i never killed anyone . 
give me the film . 
can i interest you in a battery operated - vagina ? 
how long you been working there ? 
who is he ? 
look .  .  .  that &apos;s awful generous and everything .  .  . 
mister welles .  you &apos;re very prompt . 
uh huh ,  pleasure . 
he succeeded . 
it won &apos;t work like that . 
do you think the film could have cost that much ? 
you told me to look ,  so i looked . 
nothing more than a bother .   have you any news for me ? 
i didn &apos;t think there were private detectives anymore ,  except on tv . 
if there &apos;s anything you feel uncomfortable talking about ,  tell me ,  but i have to ask .   your husband .  .  .  he committed suicide ? 
i didn &apos;t mean to .  .  . 
i .  .  .  i shouldn &apos;t take anymore of your time .   maybe we can finish tomorrow .   i &apos;ll call tomorrow .  .  . 
you were right .   i didn &apos;t find anything .   i &apos;m going to run and get something to eat .  are you hungry ? 
i think about it everyday .   but ,  every time the phone rings .  .  .  every single time ,  i still think it &apos;s her . 
mrs .  mathews ,  your daughter is dead .  she &apos;s dead . 
the um .  .  .  you &apos;ll find my invoice in the envelope .  if that &apos;s all .  .  . 
yeah .   she &apos;d be half as strict as you . 
i can &apos;t go back to sleep again . 
my mom taught me when i was little .   did you ever hear of the dream master ? 
no offense ,  or anything ,  but it &apos;s kind of hard to swallow . 
you don &apos;t really get it .   he &apos;s not a nightstalker .   it &apos;ll take more than bench presses to beat him . 
here we are . 
what the hell was that ? 
i don &apos;t get it . 
honey ,  we went over this in therapy . 
i &apos;ll tell you later . 
look ,  i appreciate what you &apos;re offering ,  but no .   he is my responsibility . 
we know you &apos;ve been through a lot but there &apos;s more than your feelings at stake here . 
hey .  .  . wake up . 
is that who you &apos;re waiting for ? 
mommy .  .  .  ? 
where is he ? 
you stopped it didn &apos;t you ?   it was probably just a regular bad dream . 
dad ! 
since when are you such a smart shopper ? 
and so is your baby .   you &apos;ve got more than just yourself to think of now ! 
he sure loves to stay awake . 
i want to talk to both you guys about greta .   and .  .  . 
tell me some more about this krueger guy . 
they think i &apos;m nuts . 
poor woman .  .  . 
oh man !   i could &apos;ve gone all night without looking at that . 
what is it ? 
maybe  -  just  &apos;maybe &apos;  -  when their ship doesn &apos;t return  -  they &apos;ll decide not to come here ,  after all . 
one of the finest men ,  and officers ,  alive .   a real hero  -  in the best sense of the word  -  in world war two .   he taught us engineering and design .  fought like a demon to develop atom subs . 
i think you &apos;re right . 
is there any way out of it ? 
it &apos;s possible i could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the icbm  -  so it would  &apos;home &apos; on the saucer when he rises from the pole . 
 .  .  . above murmansk ,  and finland . 
as we near the pole .  .  . 
what &apos;s the running time ? 
remove your weapons ,  commander .  and come here  -  alone ! 
are you alright ,  wade ? 
 .  .  . if jack told the truth ,  he could be free by the time he &apos;s my age . 
oh . 
he &apos;s on to us ! 
maybe i can buy him off .  i gotta talk to mel . 
i get it .   no sweat .  you &apos;ll get yourself a deer and you &apos;ll get him dead .  and you &apos;ll have him by coffee time . 
fresh tracks .   deer shit .  big one .  here &apos;s your buck ,  mr .  twombley .  i &apos;ll circle around . 
bastard &apos;s got his high beams on . 
yeah .  yeah ,  right ,  i &apos;m mad .  what &apos;d you tell her ,  for christ sake ? 
she won &apos;t be here for a half hour .  think you can stand it that long ? 
i don &apos;t know .  for the food business .  i guess .  i just thought ,  you know ,  we &apos;d sneak a big mac on mommy ,  like we used to . 
what &apos;s the hurry ? 
he more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something .  that &apos;s what usually happens . 
i saw mel gordon in here this morning . 
you ever come to your father &apos;s grave anymore ? 
don &apos;t worry .  i can protect my virtue .  i mean ,  c &apos;mon ,  wade ,  give me a break . 
yeah ,  but never what you looked like .  not really .  never really studied your face ,  like now .  i was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now ,  this way . 
then .  .  .  i guess you have to . 
it makes me sad . 
take care ,  wade . 
you talked to jack ? 
well ,  i guess  -  -  that &apos;s what he said . 
rolfe . 
just do it . 
why didn &apos;t you call and have the furnace fixed ? 
love !  what the fuck do you know about love ? 
yeah ,  i know him  -  -  the kid that was with him .  maybe you do too .  jack hewitt .  he works for lariviere with me .  he &apos;s my best friend . 
no shit . 
don &apos;t think about it .  you &apos;re exhausted . 
pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do ,  i guess . 
i don &apos;t know .  you tell me . 
yeah ,  the guy with the bmw i told you about .  i did ,  didn &apos;t i ? 
it wasn &apos;t me .  i wasn &apos;t there ,  but i heard about it .  when i heard about it ,  it was about elbourne . 
then you accidentally see your body ,  or your face ,  or whatever ,  and you don &apos;t know who the hell it belongs to .  strange .  it &apos;s the business with the old man ,  i know ,  and how incredibly pissed i was at him ,  and also chasing jack hewitt like that ,  and the goddamned truck going through the ice ,  not to mention margie &apos;s being so upset  -  -  one thing on top of another . 
to help ,  jack ,  of course  -  -  and to nail those sonsofbitches ,  the two gordons .  that &apos;s what alma calls them .  jesus ,  rolfe ,  whose side are you on ? 
you don &apos;t want to say hi to your father ? 
we &apos;ll talk at home .   you know ,  most girls aren &apos;t as lucky as you .   for most girls seeing the bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime . 
he &apos;s in a meeting .   he can &apos;t be disturbed . 
fuck off ,  you stupid asshole . 
how was .  .  .    .  .  . the ballet ? 
daddy .  .  . 
oh ny god .  .  .  oh my god .  .  .  oh my god .  .  . 
there they are ! 
the americans say they are escorting a damaged plane .  our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747 . 
got it . 
they &apos;ve got no chutes .  they can &apos;t control the plane ,  their engines are failing and they &apos;re losing fuel . 
the chief justice ?  what on earth for ? 
tower ,  air force one has been boarded . 
this is romeo tango zulu changing call signs .   tower ,  alert air traffic ,  romeo tango zulu is now air force one .   this is air force one .  .  .  the president is safe onboard . 
and all these rooms here ? 
here &apos;s a press kit .   i &apos;ll let you guys get comfortable and once we &apos;re airborne i &apos;ll be able to schedule the interviews . 
fear will keep you alive .  any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish ,  and bound to die . 
do you have to be so brutal ? 
our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground .  our hands are completely tied while they &apos;re in the air . 
twenty minutes ? 
may i speak to you for a moment ? 
look on the bright side ,  hon .  shep here thinks i &apos;ll be a one termer . 
white house switchboard .  how may i direct your call . 
who can i say is calling ? 
mr .  president .  .  .  they &apos;re ready for you in the conference room . 
my god .  i think that was a mig . 
iraq ,  sir .  we &apos;re over iraq . 
and what do the boys on the board know about safety ,  commissioner ?   let me< / u> talk to them . 
forget it .   i was reading . 
felt like a large asteroid . 
dunn . 
elaine . 
elaine . 
elaine ,  what happened to us ? 
elaine ,  when are you going to realize simon kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way . 
i &apos;d use the word insane . 
elaine ! 
elaine ,  i &apos;m going back there .   just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can . 
kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place .   you people knew this ship wasn &apos;t ready to fly .   you played god with over a hundred lives ,  kruger ,  and for what  -  -  the prestige of your precious space program . 
simon just ejected ! 
you mean .  .  . 
so you see ,  our task isn &apos;t made any easier by ted &apos;s refusal to admit that he &apos;s sick . 
the brain is an amazingly complex organ ,  elaine . 
for the best little computer officer on the mercury mission . 
i guess this is a first for you . 
request; life support systems check . 
that &apos;s right ,  joe .   now ,  no one &apos;s going to hurt you and no one has to know what &apos;s wrong with you . 
captain ,  the coffee machine is jammed and i don &apos;t like it . 
he &apos;s carrying a bomb . 
no ,  a bomb .   now ,  as discreetly as possible ,  i want you to move the passengers into the lounge . 
that &apos;s how dry cleaning works .   now i &apos;d like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians . 
whenever your &apos;re ready ,  captain . 
no ,  dammit .   it &apos;s a matter of life or death . 
you &apos;ve been hurt . 
do you want to talk about it . 
then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there &apos;s change in the two people who share that love . 
i happened to be passing ,  and i thought you might like some corfee . 
no ,  thank you .  i take it black .  like my men . 
but i think it &apos;s time we stopped talking about me .  a woman like you  -  -  why haven &apos;t you ever married ? 
yeah ,  something like that ,  but as i say ,  they didn &apos;t have time to tell me very much . 
i won &apos;t deceive you ,  mister striker .  we &apos;re running out of time . 
can &apos;t you take a guess ? 
elaine ! 
i know things haven &apos;t been right for a long time ,  but it &apos;ll be different .  if you &apos;ll just be patient ,  i can work things out . 
don &apos;t you feel anything for me at all any more ? 
it &apos;s the truth .  what &apos;s hurt you the most is your record since the war .  different cities ,  different jobs ,  and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility . 
mostly i remember .  .  . the nights when we were together .  i remember how you used to hold me .  .  . and how i used to sit on your face and wriggle .  .  . and then afterwards how we &apos;d watch until the sun came up .  when it did ,  it was almost like .  .  . like each new day was created .  .  . only for us . 
what &apos;s his problem ? 
ted !  what are you doing ?  you can &apos;t fly this plane ! 
rain . 
rats !  i &apos;ve lost number three . 
ted .  .  . 
we &apos;d better get back now . 
oh ,  bill ,  i &apos;m going to miss you so much . 
what did you think of  &apos;great expectations ?  &apos;
how ya doing ,  honey ? 
i &apos;m an airline pilot .   ah ,  clarence ,  according to my calculations ,  with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the rockies . 
denver control ,  this is flight two - zero -  niner intersecting victor airway seven -  niner - niner . 
hi ! 
i &apos;m lisa .  oh ,  you have a guitar ! 
would either of you like another cup of coffee ? 
there &apos;s a little girl on board who &apos;s ill and .  .  . 
i like my horizons narrow . 
we are with the police department .  this is sergeant sykes ,  and i am -  - 
he &apos;s not here .   why ask me ? 
what is this ? 
a week ago two men came to see her husband .   after they left ,  he was very frightened .   she identified one of the men from a photo i showed her .   it was hubley . 
rudyard kipling ?   no shit ?   listen ,  we just need a minute of your time .  .  . 
tell me . 
who is he ? 
i &apos;m going home . 
it &apos;s all right ,  george .   it &apos;s cool .  just wait here ,  all right ?   i &apos;ll be back in a coupla minutes . 
jesus ,  this is major .   why didn &apos;t you tell me sooner ?  why &apos;d you hold out on me ? 
uh ,  george .  .  . 
george ,  c &apos;mon  -  -  lighten up .   it &apos;s a beauty of a case .   don &apos;t sweat it  -  -  we got him by the short hairs .  he ain &apos;t gonna make any more of the shit . 
what is this ?  ! 
here &apos;s hubley .   left quarantine on november thirtieth ,  relocated first to riverside ,  then moved to los angeles early in february the following year .   field of expertise :  chemical manufacturing .   looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery . 
jesus ,  are the questions too tough for you already ?   let &apos;s try again -  -   is your name porter ? 
you know i &apos;ve been over all this with fedorchuk and alterez this morning .  .  . 
goddammit ,  tug  -  -  i want to see kristin get married ,  okay ?   but -  - 
 .  .  . that &apos;s better .   pan it around a bit . 
could it be intelligent ? 
fifty - seven .  .  . oh ,  christ .  .  . 
have they located my daughter yet ? 
i get the picture . 
no .   there &apos;s no way ! 
that the atmosphere processor ? 
they &apos;re right under the primary heat exchangers . 
no good .   how do we know it &apos;ll effect their biochemistry ?   i say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit .   it &apos;s the only way to be sure . 
this is clearly an important species we &apos;re dealing with here .  we can &apos;t just arbitrarily exterminate them  -  - 
what rank ?   i believe corporal hicks has authority here . 
look ,  we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on out there .   it may just be a down transmitter .   but if it &apos;s not ,  i want you there .  .  . as an advisor .   that &apos;s all . 
sir ,  the cpu is on - line . 
we &apos;re not making that out too well .   what is it ? 
seventeen meters . 
how long after we &apos;re declared overdue can we expect a rescue ? 
newt time then can walk right up and knock . 
look ,  you started this .   now show me everything .   i can handle myself . 
you know ,  burke ,  i don &apos;t know which species is worse .   you don &apos;t see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage . 
locked . 
looks like it stung him . 
you can &apos;t help them .   right now they &apos;re being cocooned just like the others . 
twelve meters .   man ,  this is a big fucking signal .   ten meters . 
nine meters .   eight . 
and how are we today ? 
just terrible ?   that &apos;s better than yesterday at least . 
bad dreams again ?   do you want something to help you sleep ? 
they &apos;d be here if they could ,  honey .   i know they would . 
gone . 
newt .   newt ,  wake up . 
this way .   come on ,  we &apos;re almost there ! 
a sweetheart or a pretty little wife is papageno &apos;s wish .  a willing ,  billing ,  lovey dovey would be my most tasty little dish . 
these viennese certainly know good music when they hear it . 
is there a part for me ? 
how do you know ? 
oh ! 
turkish ?  oh ,  if it &apos;s turkish ,  that &apos;s different .  i want to be in it . 
how was i ?  tell me honestly . 
your son is an unprincipled ,  spoiled ,  conceited brat . 
and how will you make him keep it ? 
humiliated ? 
no !  no !  no ! 
i think you &apos;re mad !  you &apos;re really mad ! 
stop it now .  stop it .  i &apos;ve brought some friends to meet you .  they &apos;re next door waiting .  do we have anything to eat ?  they &apos;re all starving . 
wolfi ! 
she won &apos;t talk to me .  she says she has to speak to you . 
yes ,  my love ? 
what ? 
i don &apos;t trust this man .  and i didn &apos;t like what he did with your opera .  it was common . 
who was that ? 
no .  don &apos;t answer it ! 
give me one reason i can understand . 
then he didn &apos;t send you ? 
thank you very much ,  your excellency . 
are you sure you can &apos;t leave that music ,  and come back again ?  i have other things you might like . 
what are you doing here ? 
this is not his handwriting . 
be careful ! 
i said play ! 
really ? 
i was .  but she quite outgrew the little i could show her . 
delightful ,  court composer .  would you permit me to play it as he comes in ? 
yes ,  of course .  my concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism . 
why so ? 
keep it ,  sire ,  if you want to .  it is already here in my head . 
it is new ,  it is ,  isn &apos;t it ,  sire ? 
well ,  what do you have for me today ? 
she &apos;s very tired ,  poor creature .  you know me :  i &apos;m a real pig .  it &apos;s not so easy cleaning up after me . 
it couldn &apos;t be better . 
what do you mean ?  it &apos;s wonderful .  really ,  it &apos;s  -  it &apos;s marvelous !  people love me here . 
pupils ? 
isn &apos;t that marvelous ?  we &apos;re delighted . 
thank you .  that &apos;ll be fine .  don &apos;t spend any money on me . 
don &apos;t worry ,  i &apos;m not staying here to be a burden . 
father  - 
is he working ? 
are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn &apos;t want us to know who he is ? 
of course !  what else do you think they speak here ? 
put it down ,  i said !  it &apos;s nothing for you . 
what ? 
herr mozart .  what a surprise .  what can i do for you ? 
dear mozart ,  my sincere congratulations . 
no ,  but i &apos;m broke .  i &apos;m always broke .  i don &apos;t know why . 
do you have a daughter ? 
i can &apos;t say .  really
but what is it they don &apos;t like ? 
it &apos;s the best opera yet written .  i know it !  why didn &apos;t they come ? 
yes ? 
what happened ?  is it over ? 
wait !  ask him if he &apos;d give me some money now .  tell him if he would ,  that would help me finish it . 
start with the voices .  basses first .  second beat of the first measure  -  a .   con - fu - ta - tis .   second measure ,  second beat .   ma - le - dic - tis .   g - sharp ,  of course . 
good .  now the tenors .  fourth beat of the first measure  -  c .   con - fu - ta - tis .   second measure ,  fourth beat on d .   ma - le - dic - tis .   all right ? 
with the tenors . 
then why especially does it have to be in german ? 
what are you doing ,  herr director ? 
is the emperor angry with me ? 
naturally ,  the italians !  of course !  always the italians ! 
mozart  - 
mozart ,  music is not the issue here .  no one doubts your talent .  it is your judgment of literature that &apos;s in question .  even with the politics taken out ,  this thing would still remain a vulgar farce .  why waste your spirit on such rubbish ?   surely you can choose more elevated themes ? 
what do you want ? 
is it true ? 
all i ever wanted was to sing to him .  that &apos;s his doing ,  isn &apos;t it ?  he gave me that longing  -  then made me mute .  why ?  tell me that .  if he didn &apos;t want me to serve him with music ,  why implant the desire ,  like a lust in my body ,  then deny me the talent ?  go on ,  tell me !  speak for him ! 
yes . 
this is embarrassing ,  you know .  you introduced mozart to some of my friends and he &apos;s begging from practically all of them .  it has to stop . 
what shall we do ? 
you &apos;re certain he &apos;s lucid ?  you won &apos;t need any help ? 
you haven &apos;t eaten your lunch . 
what do you dream about ? 
i &apos;m sorry .  i shouldn &apos;t have asked you . 
that &apos;s easy enough . 
what ? 
are you better now ? 
my friend jack was just here . 
but ,  david . 
waking up at the zoo ,  that &apos;s not so insane .  having no clothes on ?  that &apos;s insane .  what did i do last night ,  alex ? 
how are we feeling tonight ? 
why are you doing this to me ,  jack ? 
here ,  gladys ,  tom .  did you hear the one about the crashing plane ? 
how long have i been here ? 
no .  in fact ,  your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here . 
it is impossible for a body like that to be dull . 
hello . 
nice looking group . 
what about it ? 
ask them what the candles are for . 
did you hear that ? 
okay ,  you &apos;ve seen me .  now go away . 
hi ,  jack . 
you look awful . 
no ,  thank you ,  doctor . 
you were saying ? 
the forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved ,  that &apos;s true ,  but i hardly think .  .  . 
what can we do to assist you ? 
sorry . 
i cannot accept a connection between david kessler and last night &apos;s murders .  we will find him ,  however .  i can assure you of that . 
about twenty - four thousand . 
charlie ! 
i remember once when your account checked . 
what good will that do ? 
how are you protecting your depositors ?  by making a lot of idiotic loans ! 
you know dickson as well as we do .  he &apos;ll shut the doors before he gives up control . 
we want to talk to you . 
i know that among you ,  you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city .  get that money over here and i &apos;ll stop this run within five minutes . 
stand back inspector ,  or i &apos;ll shoot .  drop that gun . 
i was crazy ,  i tell you ,  mr .  dickson .  i didn &apos;t know what i was doing .  i wandered around in a daze .  all i could think of was that they were going to kill me  .   .   .   you &apos;ll stand by me ,  won &apos;t you ,  mr .  dickson ?  you won &apos;t go back on me now ,  will you ?  i &apos;ll die if they send me to prison ! 
then what did you want to gamble for ?  if you &apos;d have beat us out of fifty g &apos;s ,  you &apos;d have been paid ,  wouldn &apos;t you ?  well ,  we want our dough . 
this won &apos;t do .  not during business hours  .   .   . 
me ? 
doesn &apos;t that come next ? 
but i &apos;m giving a party for him  -  a real ,  old - fashioned surprise party .  caps ,  bells ,  whistles ,  and everything .  i &apos;m really terribly excited about it .  i &apos;ve been planning it for months . 
now wait a minute ,  wait a minute .  .  . 
why ,  cyril ,  you &apos;re insane
i knew i couldn &apos;t trust you .  you told me you were taking me home . 
no .  no ,  i &apos;m afraid papa isn &apos;t that much interested .  he &apos;s too busy rushing off to philadelphia to make stuffy ,  old speeches at stuffy ,  old bankers &apos; meetings .  too busy closing big ,  important deals  i think i will have a drink . 
you know ,  there ought to be a congressional medal for men like you .  america &apos;s comfort to misunderstood wives .  i never thought i would find myself in that class . 
that will be just about enough !  now get out of here ! 
i &apos;m feeling fine this morning . 
good morning ,  mr .  dickson .  my wife is much better this morning . 
listen ,  dear .  now tell me the truth about this .  were you in cluett &apos;s apartment ? 
helen ,  tell matt i want to see him . 
yes ? 
helen ! 
oh ,  make that uniform blue . 
it &apos;s all right .  thanks . 
aw ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  mr .  dickson .  it &apos;s just kind of sudden ,  that &apos;s all .   sure ,  i &apos;m excited .  i think it &apos;s great .  only ,  well ,  you &apos;ve done so much for me already  .   .   .  i &apos;ll never be able to thank you enough . 
no .  i won &apos;t . 
what &apos;s the matter ?  what &apos;s going on here ?   this is ridiculous !  you can &apos;t hold this boy on a vague suspicion . 
of course it &apos;s true  -  and he knows it . 
the lobby &apos;s half filled now . 
they &apos;ve been coming in steady all morning .  i have called for some extra police . 
yes ,  sir . 
hello ,  helen ! 
no . 
now you &apos;ve got me worried ,  dear .   promise me you won &apos;t butt in . 
oh ,  matt  .   .   . 
they must have turned him down . 
the big guys have got the screws on him .  you &apos;ve got to come through for him ,  mr .  conway .  he came through for you a hundred times .  if his friends don &apos;t help him ,  who is going to help him ? 
did you say dude finlay ? 
he was in the bank yesterday . 
dude finlay ? 
what time did matt brown get in ? 
our place ,  clell miller &apos;s ,  sammy johnston ,  the creeders .  will hite . 
these are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad . 
uhh ,  yeah it does . 
cole ,  we &apos;re outlaws .  not exactly the most respectable job ,  if you know what i mean . 
how &apos;d they  -  - 
i swear  -  - 
the army can hang him . 
you have no shame . 
the things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here .  .  . 
thanks for the help . 
the war ?  what ,  are you crazy ?   there are things i miss about it . 
this isn &apos;t a feud ,  this is war .  they &apos;ve got more men than we do .  we kill detectives ,  they can replace  &apos;em in a day . 
see ,  frank &apos;s being smart about this . 
it &apos;ll be the biggest score yet . 
beautiful . 
fine .  we hit this bank . 
oh ,  lord ,  the dance hall girl at bunty &apos;s .  .  . 
hey !  we decide something ,  that &apos;s it !  we &apos;re in this for the long haul ,  and this idea of me and jesse &apos;s will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin &apos; up on us in our sleep .  we &apos;ve got to think  -  - 
jesse . 
east ?  east above the river heading for the eagle pass ? 
what the  -  - 
old man tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank . 
boys .  .  . 
he &apos;s going to be fine ,  right daddy ? 
so you &apos;re saying i could have done more to attract their attention . 
hello ,  liberty missoura ! 
all we thought about was coming home .  i swore i &apos;d kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again .  if i have to go to war with the railroad to stay ,  fine by me . 
you are a charmer . 
didn &apos;t think you would .   i &apos;m going to go make the coffin . 
gents ,  we are in the middle of something here . 
what do you want me to say ,  frank ?  i was killing men when i was fifteen .  i like getting shot at .  i like riding out of town with a posse at my back .  this is a helluva better life than farming . 
 .  .  . every time you tell that story ,  you stop there .  that &apos;s not how it ended .  i was five when my dad got shot . 
riders  -  - 
arr .  hand over your jewels ,  missy . 
smart .  funny .  bossy .  always makes me think she &apos;s two steps ahead of me .  and big buck teeth . 
ahem .   &quot; from this doctrine .  .  .  &quot;  no ,  ah .  .  .   &quot; from women &apos;s eyes this doctrine i derive ,  they sparkle still like  .  .  .  shiny .  .  .  sparkling rocks .  .  .  &quot; 
whose justice ?  yours or god &apos;s ?   when will you stop ? 
zee . 
that &apos;s .  .  .  wonderful .  it &apos;s just .  .  .  i thought .  .  . 
aw ,  shucks ,  ma &apos;am .  .  . 
almost got me in billings .  i saw you there ,  shooting at me . 
the railroad has no business in tennessee .  therefore i have no interest in the state of tennessee . 
this is unusual .  most of our marriages are members of the congregation . 
you okay ,  jesse ? 
tell you something else .   i can &apos;t drink that good neither .  i &apos;m going to go outside and throw up . 
not at all . 
how can that be ? 
mr .  thaddeus rains ,  sir ,  it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field . 
good . 
leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers . 
you see the army leaving and you see the loss of a tool .  i see a power void to be filled .  as we have the most power ,  we may move with impunity . 
they exchanged fire with the pinkerton guards ,  killing several of them .  then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile . 
how did you know ? 
i want them arrested and hanged ! 
 &quot; the gang made off with thirty - five thousand dollars and also destroyed the thaxton switch construction ,  meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land !  &quot;   who wrote this !  ?  i &apos;ll see him hanged every tuesday for a month ! 
it &apos;s early in the game yet ,  mr .  rains .  jesse james and i are just learning how each other moves ,  feeling out each other &apos;s patterns . 
yes ,  that &apos;s the way to win the locals back to our side . 
every three months ,  the james gang circles back to the vicinity of liberty ,  missouri .  they always pull a job right before they return ,  probably to have extra money to give family and friends . 
what the hell is that sound ? 
uh huh . 
i know .  stop it . 
i can &apos;t . 
dorsia &apos;s nice . 
okay .  yeah .  what time ? 
pick me up ? 
pull out ,  goddamnit ! 
why ? 
oh christ ,  this really isn &apos;t worth it .  and see ,  courtney ,  it &apos;s there for what ?  huh ?  tell us .   why is it pulled down half an inch ?  so it can catch the force of the ejaculate ! 
really ? 
yes ,  darling ? 
we should do it . 
your hairline looks like it &apos;s receding . 
i want a firm commitment . 
you &apos;re inhuman . 
if you really want to do something for me ,  you can stop making this scene right now . 
jesus ,  davis .  yes .  that was hilarious .  that was you ,  wasn &apos;t it ? 
by the way davis ,  how is cynthia ?  you &apos;re still seeing her ,  right ? 
jeez .  that &apos;s not a helluva lot ,  is it ? 
raised lettering ,  pale nimbus white .  .  . 
and bateman ,  what are you so fucking zany about ? 
i said we are totally booked . 
there are no tables available tonight .  the waiting list is also totally booked . 
ricky hendricks has to cancel today .  he didn &apos;t say what he was canceling or why . 
i &apos;ll do it . 
what is it ? 
tell him i &apos;m at lunch . 
yes ,  patrick ? 
oh ,  i can &apos;t .   i don &apos;t know . 
soooo .  .  . dorsia is where jean wants to go .  .  . 
yes ?  you &apos;re dressed .  .  . okay . 
want a bite ? 
well ,  i guess i do .  for a long time i was too focused on my work ,  i think ,  but now i &apos;ve really begun to think about changing myself ,  you know ,  developing ,  and .  .  . growing . 
forget it . 
oh .  uh ,  tape .  duct tape .  i .  .  . need it for .  .  .  taping something .  bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun . 
if you stay ,  i think something bad will happen .  i think i might hurt you .   you don &apos;t want to get hurt ,  do you ? 
patrick ?  i can &apos;t hear you . 
where are you ?  patrick ,  what &apos;s wrong ? 
so ,  what do you do ? 
maybe we could have lunch one day next week ?  you know ,  i &apos;m downtown near wall street quite often . 
your address ? 
anything else you can tell me about owen ? 
was he involved at all  ,  do you think ,  in occultism or satan worship ? 
had his apartment been burglarized ? 
yeah .  no finlandia ,  as usual .  fucking dump . 
well ,  i could he wrong . 
well ,  thank you ,  mr .  bateman . 
listen ,  i &apos;m a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when i &apos;ve sorted out all this information ? 
i &apos;ve questioned him . 
i &apos;m so hungry . 
gee ,  uh ,  that &apos;s too bad . 
why don &apos;t you get another one ?  why don &apos;t  ,  you get another job ? 
speak up .  come on . 
you like huey lewis and the news ? 
you are a fanatic . 
you know he &apos;s never been anybody &apos;s counselor before ? 
to our new life .    .  .  . what &apos;s wrong ? 
if you can &apos;t deal with him on that basis ,  you better get a new counselor . 
what ! 
what &apos;re you  -  -  what ? 
go where ?  you can &apos;t get away from people like this . 
they stop the construction work at six or seven .  the parking lot &apos;s mostly clear by two or three in the morning .  even the early geeks don &apos;t get there before five . 
i know how to get in there .  but you &apos;ve gotta help me . 
if i &apos;d stayed down there ,  maybe this wouldn &apos;t &apos;ve happened . 
it &apos;s for the museum .  he knows you &apos;re a painter .  if anybody should be invited  -  - 
great ! 
 .  .  . what ? 
 &apos;didn &apos;t mention he was going to the justice department ? 
not like him ,  is it ?  to do a thing like that without telling you .  you &apos;re not losing your hold on him ,  are you ? 
milo ? 
well i parked illegally .  see y &apos;later ? 
will i get to work for outpost ? 
okay . 
 .  .  . when did you know ? 
stigma ?  larry !  60 billion buys you some slack in this world . 
milo ?  i &apos;m danny . 
the content filer has t &apos;be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms .  really ,  omniplatforms .  including whatever new hardware emerges . 
when you get to a certain age ,  you start wondering .  about your legacy .  i doubt you even remember outpost 1 . 0  -  - 
been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler .  and it came over me :  it &apos;s in the wrong place . 
no .  i just went deeper into the machine .  preferred being the geek to having to explain .  lying would &apos;ve been worse . 
ready for number three ? 
did i say something ? 
so ,  when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers .  was that then ?  or now ? 
i snuck into #21 . 
i know why you &apos;re so secretive .  why you won &apos;t let anybody near you .   i know what he did to you . 
he &apos;s out of prison ? 
why were you so careless ? 
why were you snooping in my office ? 
same with the excerpts i &apos;m choosing :  they &apos;ll play against any of the images you described . 
you could always say you have to go the bathroom . 
please don &apos;t go . 
is that how larry feels ? 
we rented a loft in sunnyvale .   you know what &apos;s the bad part ?  we can &apos;t talk about work anymore .  we &apos;re competitors !  the venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms . 
so  -  -  how far are we from the campus ?

hello ,  austin .  this is basil exposition ,  chief of british intelligence .   you &apos;re austin powers ,  international man of mystery ,  and you &apos;re with agent mrs .  kensington .  the year is 1967 ,  and you &apos;re talking on a picture phone .

where am i ? 
yes ,  well .  .  . agent kensington will get you set up .  she &apos;s very dedicated .  perhaps ,  a little too dedicated .   she &apos;s got a bit of a bug up her ass .  good luck ,  austin ,  the world &apos;s depending on you . 
oh ,  and austin .  .  . 
she &apos;s working on another lead right now . 
hello ,  exposition .

it seems the tables have turned again ,  dr .  evil . 
that &apos;s fascinating ,  vanessa .  listen ,  why don &apos;t we go into the back and shag ? 
my meat and two veg . 
why did you leave so soon ? 
good morning ,  vanessa !  i hope you have on clean underwear .

i hate having my picture taken . 
hello ,  luv . 
out and about ,  doing odds and sods .

no .  log com bird twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy ,  not stealthy ,  not carbon -  composite .   it does have an odd shape ,  sir . 
commander ,  i have to log it .  .  . 
remember when we froze your semen ,  you said that if it looked like you weren &apos;t coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever ? 
yes ,  what is it ?  you &apos;re interrupting my moment of triumph . 
scott my boy ,  come here .  how was your day ? 
don &apos;t you think we should ask for more than a million dollars ?  a million dollars isn &apos;t that much money these days . 
i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s impossible . 
you are female ? 
no women .  not in boodles .  not since 1922 . 
quite a collection .

much better . 
steed ,  we really must be  -  - 
just what is your position ,  if you don &apos;t mind my asking .   how did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work ? 
but that &apos;s absurd .  i may not be over - fond of you ,  steed ,  but it &apos;s not my style . 
either way  .  .  .  may i ask :  why you dress in that fashion ? 
three agents killed by bad weather .  .  . 
to kill me ?

 &apos;the owl and the pussycat went to sea  -  &apos;

the marriage is off .  now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life . 
and i want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment .

jumbo ,  where the hell are the women ? 
screw you .  .  .  screw that .  .  .  don &apos;t jerk me around .  you promised me 1500 seats for the police concert .  .  .  1500 ,  not fifteen !  .  .  .  screw that .  .  .  screw you  -  -  screw sting .   hi ,  guys .

under the table ! 
i don &apos;t get it .  why didn &apos;t you go for it just now ? 
this is your bachelor party .  you haven &apos;t had sex with anyone yet .

brian . 
what was that ?  oh man ,  you have picked up a few moves since john paul ii boulevard . 
no ,  he &apos;s more of a dinosaur .  guy &apos;s not a dummy ,  though .  he &apos;s juggling alot of balls on this one . 
this is one of the oldest fire stations in the city .  lotta tradition locked up in here .  what do you think ? 
y &apos;know ,  four years ago i was working in a bakery .  two years ago i was bringing marty coffee and he didn &apos;t even know my name .  i run that office now .  marty believed in me and i believe in him .  you want me to just throw that away ? 
i think your boss is going to need some spin control . 
famous story even .  straight burn .  just an engine and truck first on scene .  what did you feel ,  brian ,  when you first got there ? 
very good ,  brian .   -  -  about your report here .  the way to a torch &apos;s heart is through his tools .  that &apos;s how you know him .  it &apos;s the way he talks to the fire .  and to you if you listen . 
i want another shot ,  sir . 
are you still here ? 
son of a bitch tears  &apos;em apart just to eat the oxygen .  wouldn &apos;t take much at all to melt ten gauge wire .  problem &apos;s burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace  -  -  unless you could find something that would eat its residue . 
i don &apos;t guess . 
why backdrafts .  whoever fried seagrave and cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire ,  but also made sure the fire blew itself out . 
what the hell are you doing here ? 
so seagrave and holcomb were accountants .  .  . 
your brother was a good man . 
completely out of control . 
do you have to do that ? 
uh huh .  and  &quot; pioneer &apos;s pride ,  mobile log cabins &quot;  .  that was in your blood about six months wasn &apos;t it ? 
fireman shit ? 
i hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it . 
they &apos;re waitin &apos; man . 
i just wanted to ,  i don &apos;t know ,  not exactly apologize for the other night  -  -  especially since i don &apos;t remember much of it  -  - 
i treated you better . 
what &apos;s wrong ,  stephen ?   c &apos;mon ,  you only beat up the roof when something &apos;s on your mind .   how &apos;s brian doing ? 
ah stephen ,  that &apos;s what this is really about ,  isn &apos;t it ?  you always have to be right . 
look ,  i &apos;m sorry i  -  - 
didn &apos;t think you &apos;d make it . 
who &apos;s this ? 
sure ronald ?  you &apos;re ready alright . 
alderman swayzak . 
don &apos;t you have any leads at all ? 
i &apos;m gonna need some bread ,  man .  this ain &apos;t fair .  i &apos;m always here for you ,  and you can &apos;t even take decent care of me .  my landlord is bitching like a motherfucker !  you &apos;re two months behind on the rent ,  lieutenant ! 
christ !  shit !  i could kill them all with my bare hands . 
but you could do it ,  baby .  we could use the bread .  .  . 
double or nothing ?  are you fucking out of your mind ? 
take your money ?  this guy will blow up your house and everyone in it ! 
forgive me father ,  for i have sinned .  it has been two days since my last confession .  father ,  my sin is a terrible sin .  a sin of omission .  there was another sin that happened at the same time ,  and in the same place ,  but my sin i think was graver stil . 
as i have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning  -  -  and my sin .  you see ,  father  -  - 
my name is honeycutt and i want to try something different .   can you do this for me ? 
let &apos;s go niggers ! 
you idiot .   you almost gave me a massive coronary . 
what do you do ? 
it &apos;s that bad ,  huh ?   it &apos;s all over my face . 
what &apos;s that ? 
what &apos;s wrong with him ? 
de - la - croix . 
gentlemen ,  the show ,  our show will be satirical .   you know what that is ,  don &apos;t you ?   trust me on this one . 
hurry up ,  i wanna watch hbo . 
ahh ,  the luxuries of life . 
we ran out without my shoes and the floor .   i gotta get my stuff .   what about our savings ? 
but the line has to be drawn . 
 .  .  . exactly thirty - two minutes ago . 
four minutes ago . 
what is it you want from me ?   some plantation follies ?   some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch ?   some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads ?   you want me to go back to the ante bellum days ? 
every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons  -  mantan and sleep  &apos;n eat .   the dusky duo . 
ignorant ,  dullwitted ,  lazy ,  and unlucky . 
that &apos;s exactly my point .   has he even directed actors before in anything ? 
i &apos;m gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone . 
i love you too ,  daddy . 
don &apos;t tell him it &apos;s from me or he won &apos;t take it . 
how can this be ?   you and me at the same time ,  the exact same thought .  it &apos;s scary . 
your life will never be the same . 
we both lied to him . 
how so ? 
why &apos;d you do that ? 
that crazy brother of yours doesn &apos;t think so . 
that which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light .   this bucket of blood . 
that was a mistake ,  but i don &apos;t regret it . 
not nervous ?   relaxed ? 
you getting scared because some people don &apos;t like what you are doing ? 
oh ,  is it ?   buddy boy ,  in this business if people don &apos;t produce ,  they get fired . 
mantan ,  we got a show to tape . 
you must think i &apos;m some kind of fool . 
mommy ,  please don &apos;t call me that . 
peerless ,  your father called . 
this is a tv show ,  not a music video . 
i never had a really real pair before . 
no ,  we &apos;re not knocking boots .   i got this internship while i still was at nyu ,  dela was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant . 
don &apos;t you feel that is a simplistic retort ? 
to come back to our roots . 
no mo &apos;  &quot; city slickers .  &quot;   ahh ,  can &apos;t you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton ? 
cousins ,  i want all of you to go to your windows .   go to your windows and yell .   yell ,  i &apos;m tired of the drugs ,  the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents .   i &apos;m tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks .  i &apos;m tired ,  you &apos;re tired ,  we &apos;re all tired of these so - called bible -  thumping god fearing ,  whore mongling professional athletes .   aren &apos;t you tired of these basketball - dunking ,  football - running ,  hop - hip rapping ebonic - speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different ho &apos;s ?   i know i am and so is sleep  &apos;n eat . 
around .  .  . 
i fell out of my bed last night . 
sleep  &apos;n eat ,  i was my wife &apos;s husband and grandchild at one and the same time .   and lo &apos; and behold ,  as the husband of a person &apos;s grandmother is his grandfather ,  i mantan ,  became my own grandfather . 
what else ? 
maybe you need to start . 
why all of a sudden are you flippin &apos; on me ?   this blackface thing was part of the deal from the git - go .  don &apos;t even try to play it like you ain &apos;t a part of all this .   you down with delacroix . 
how did you get this gig ? 
stop playing me sloan . 
where are you bound for ? 
good morning ,  private james .   please come in .   i should like you to meet my uncle ,  herr minister of police galgenstein . 
she took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband .   she is now mrs .  john best . 
oh ,  i am thinking of the o &apos;higgins of redmondstown .   general o &apos;higgins was a close friend of my wife &apos;s dear father ,  colonel granby somerset . 
ten thousand ?   but the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand . 
i believe they will deport you . 
but if ,  when i love ,  i am unhappy ,  i will know that my empty heart was my good fortune . 
it is only too possible .   love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult ,  and it is even more difficult to make it last . 
you want my heart ? 
be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are ? 
why are you shaking ? 
as you have been robbed of your purse ,  may i have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home ? 
mister bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life ,  and meditated a separation ,  in which case ,  she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance ,  and subject them ,  at any rate ,  to a doubtful and expensive litigation .  they were quite insistent on this point ,  and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship &apos;s perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital . 
one of the boys in the stable told nelly that you &apos;ve already bought my horse ,  and that it &apos;s at doolan &apos;s farm ,  where mick the groom is breaking it in .   is that true ,  papa ? 
sir william cosgrove ,  with his complication of ills ,  was dying before us by inches .   he was continually tinkered up by doctors ,  and ,  what with my usual luck ,  he might be restored to health and live i don &apos;t know how many years .   if cosgrove would not die ,  where was the use of my pursing his lady ?   but my fears were to prove groundless ,  for on that very night ,  patient nature would claim her account . 
sir ,  let those laugh that win . 
yeah ,  if you &apos;ve slept . 
what about pike ? 
you framed - him .  .  . 
this isn &apos;t our area .  whose area is this  -  - 
you &apos;re under military arrest ,  it &apos;s not gonna happen .  what &apos;s wrong with baseball ? 
well ,  it &apos;s a game of anticipation ,  that &apos;s the beauty . 
you did basic here ? 
there &apos;s no need .  .  . 
right .  now ,  i &apos;m gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more ,  okay ? 
hey ,  ray !  just had a nice talk with your buddy kendall  -  -  seems you killed three people ! 
fuck  &quot; you &apos;re serious &quot;  ,  raymond ,  you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we &apos;d take the word of a crackhead over yours ,  so if you &apos;ve got something to say ,  say it . 
raymond ,  for you to have any chance of coming out of this ,  we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony .  otherwise this is just another story  -  - 
where &apos;s the cabin ? 
cadet ,  what &apos;s your name ! 
whose blood is that ,  jay ? 
you gotta untie me .   i didn &apos;t do this thing ,  ray . 
maybe ,  but that don &apos;t make me a killer  -  - 
ray ,  this is my life here .  i ain &apos;t gonna pretend i &apos;m not happy west is gone ,  but you know i couldn &apos;t have done this .  it &apos;s not in me . 
full clip to the body  -  - 
that &apos;s it .  you &apos;re that policeman with friends in low places .  tell me ,  how &apos;s guissepe torres doing these days ?  those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer  -  - 
levi ,  i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re familiar with investigative work ,  but we have this little thing called  &quot; motive &quot;  and you just gave yourself one . 
epileptic attacks are murder on your system .  rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer . 
jail if he &apos;s lucky ,  the gas chamber if he &apos;s not  -  - 
which gives us about five hours .  why &apos;d you call me ? 
i &apos;m sorry ,  bill . 
it was so good ,  i actually forgot you &apos;re one of the bigger dogs now .  the base commander .  the one in control .  you couldn &apos;t let him testify ,  could you ? 
what i can &apos;t understand is why you signed these .  if you &apos;d just let west take care of the paperwork ,  no one would have known ,  but you got careless .  so when pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him ,  too . 
hostile and uncooperative . 
levi ?  who names their kid levi  -  - 
is dunbar cute ? 
this is the straight hitting on me you were talking about ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
you guys really got the shit kicked out of you here . 
he &apos;s telling the truth ,  up to a point . 
i just .  .  .  he came back for kendall .  i don &apos;t think he &apos;s capable of murder . 
west was a monster !  fifteen years ago ,  i was here ,  i was section eight ,  i was pike .  fuck being the knife dummy  -  -  that thing he did ,  stripping pike down ,  making him stand outside all night ?  he did that every year ,  he did that to me .  fifteen years ago ,  i wanted him dead ,  and now i &apos;m supposed to care that somebody offed him ?  sorry ,  no can do .  i tried . 
so it &apos;s a good plan but it goes wrong; mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy ,  which means they have to bring dunbar and kendall into the cover story  -  - 
little bit . 
we &apos;re fucked ,  i know  -  - 
that &apos;s not true . 
how ? 
maybe we shouldn &apos;t go . 
he said what ? 
dunbar says you were . 
hurricane &apos;s due after midnight and we &apos;re still going out ? 
he &apos;s not army ,  it &apos;s not official  -  - 
you both know if you do this ,  if you go after a senator &apos;s son and you &apos;re wrong .  .  .  it &apos;s not just me in the hot seat anymore . 
i don &apos;t have a job ,  but i would have a job if you gave me one .  and i may not have much ,  but i have more determination than any man you &apos;re ever going to meet . 
her name is sandra templeton .  she &apos;s going to auburn .  the semester &apos;s almost over ,  so you better hurry . 
you were expecting me ? 
you won &apos;t find a better place ! 
or are you too scared ? 
then do it . 
how are you gonna make it without your shoes ? 
lord ,  i &apos;m sorry i .  .  . 
really . 
he was buttering her rolls .  pumping her churn .  splashing milk in her box . 
spooning the sherbet . 
that &apos;s because we didn &apos;t have a wedding .  your mother - in - law was never supposed to marry me .  she was engaged to somebody else . 
i didn &apos;t forget .  i was just working on a tangent .  see ,  most men ,  they &apos;ll tell a story straight through ,  and it won &apos;t be complicated ,  but it won &apos;t be interesting either . 
you don &apos;t like it ? 
jesus christ . 
the one about the witch . 
having a kid changes everything .  i mean ,  there &apos;s the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings .  .  . 
i saw my death in that eye .  and this is not how it happens . 
son ? 
dad ! 
you don &apos;t even know me . 
i was drying out . 
this is it ?  the whole vault . 
are you jenny hill ? 
thank you .  i &apos;ll bet you need to  -  - 
i spent a week in morocco for the story .  it was incredible . 
i &apos;m going to check on him . 
do you love your father ? 
you have to understand .  when i was growing up ,  he was gone more than he was here .  and i started thinking  -  -  maybe he has a second life somewhere else .  with another house ,  another family .  he leaves us ,  he goes to them .  or maybe there is no family .  maybe he never wanted a family .  but whatever it is ,  maybe he likes that second life better .  and the reason he tells all those stories is because he can &apos;t stand this boring place . 
what happened ? 
how is he ? 
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve seen it ,  but josephine has some photos in the most recent newsweek . 
before i forget ,  your father has papers in the basement i &apos;d like you to go through .  i wouldn &apos;t know what &apos;s important . 
was she one of your teachers ? 
mom ? 
so you never bought any land . 
i got you those trousers from paul smith . 
when we went to the hard rock cafe .  who paid ?  when we went to see  &apos;cats &apos; .  who paid ? 
how &apos;s that ?  we can &apos;t drink our piss can we ? 
you must find some glasses ,  small ,  for the toast ,  and some plates . 
i need to know who you are first please . 
she says  &apos;hello &apos; to you .  go for it john ! 
when ? 
binoculars .

good .  or should i speak slower ? 
uh .  .  .  are you a giraffe ? 
what ? 
so ,  uh ,  alexei ,  which i know isn &apos;t his name .  .  . 
oh jesus . 
and ?  what are you saying ? 
i think it &apos;s my safest bet ,  don &apos;t you ? 
the rest of the world ,  john ,  it &apos;s not all like st .  albans . 
do you know if it &apos;s a boy or a girl ? 
okay .  goodbye .

me up the .  .  . 
i do believe the monsignor finally got a point . 
don &apos;t even do it ,  ya bastard . 
a p - penny saved is worth two in the bush .

where are you goin &apos; ?   did you tell him ? 
there he goes .   okay ,  gentlemen .  are we ready to bring this man into the light ?  are we ready to truly do the work of the lord ? 
that &apos;s the guy that got us off the hook with the  &quot; checkov &quot;  thing . 
baumgartner sound irish to you ,  fuck face ? 
no !  fuck you !  you start getting excited !  we gotta fucking go ! 
duffy .  this look like a fucking post office to you ?  this guy came in here with intent .  maybe he didn &apos;t know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea .  the bartender wasn &apos;t a fucking accident . 
a couple of peons for the mob and .  .  . 
what if it was just one guy with six guns ? 
what are you serious ? 
no .  you sure you &apos;re okay ? 
liberating isn &apos;t it ? 
i believe these young men are right . 
you gonna do what i say ,  got it ? 
i always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh .  they always come around telling me what a crack up you are .  what is it they call you ? 
ok .  that &apos;s wrong . 
now that window can never be locked .  it &apos;s impossible . 
it &apos;s got a v - 8 ,  dignan . 
did you see that ? 
ok .  escape route .  the most important thing you can have is an escape route .  just in case somebody &apos;s tailing us .  or even chasing us ,  as the case may be  -  - 
yeah . 
what &apos;s wrong with him ? 
yes ,  they are . 
ok .  go ahead . 
this is inez .  carmen .  anita . 
he needs to hire an attorney . 
obviously .  that &apos;s a given . 
see ,  one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor mr .  langston &apos;s house and anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious .  i had to dive in and save him . 
when &apos;d he tell you ? 
we &apos;re going over to this bar if you feel like going . 
i have an idea for that . 
i &apos;m not .  but there &apos;s  -  - 
that &apos;s what she is ! 
you &apos;re in love with the fucking housekeeper ! 
i want you to look at this . 
dignan .  take it easy . 
i don &apos;t know ,  dignan .  you went crazy . 
do you like inez ? 
i &apos;ve got a great view up here .  i can see all the  -  - 
freeze ! 
what &apos;d he get ? 
why ? 
i think i may have found a way out of here . 
it &apos;s hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle . 
you mean a safecracker ? 
sure ,  sure .  he &apos;s a great person ,  and i &apos;d call bullshit on anybody who said differently .  but i wonder if the kid has the goods  up here . 
that was a test ? 
i &apos;ll tell you ,  anthony .  times like this i get philosophical .  what does it mean ?  what &apos;s it all about ?  are you afraid to die ? 
the fear of death ,  the pain of consciousness .   did you mix this martini ? 
but you &apos;re thieves .  it &apos;s what you are . 
we &apos;re renegades from despair . 
in your backyard ?  how do you protect them ? 
you &apos;ll probably have them the rest of your life . 
why don &apos;t you just tell them the truth .  those belong to my neighbor phil . 
yeah .  one minute you &apos;re studying great expectations and the next minute you &apos;re drawing the holy mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend . 
let &apos;s not even talk about it . 
give him a second . 
you ok ,  bob ? 
what are you doing ? 
does my skin feel soft ,  anthony ? 
did you ever hear of the s .  cooper trust robbery ? 
well ,  what do you think ? 
no . 
he looks like he was designed by scientists .  for desert warfare . 
how much could you grow ?  realistically . 
bob . 
it was an accidental .  i don &apos;t want to go into the details .  it was just one of those senior pranks that didn &apos;t really go right .  i mean ,  obviously ,  since swifty &apos;s dead .  that &apos;s why anthony never graduated . 
is he chasing us ? 
then how come they haven &apos;t set the bail yet ?  that &apos;s unconstitutional . 
you said 48 hours ! 
bob ,  you &apos;re lying ! 
that &apos;s ok . 
i couldn &apos;t hear anything . 
applejack drove . 
how &apos;s that 700 bucks coming ? 
you keeping out of trouble ? 
and what does that cover ? 
dignan .  good to see you .  good to see you applejack .   who are you ? 
is he in ? 
fuck you .  you a hoto . 
he left yesterday on the night train .  he &apos;s probably just getting in now .   you &apos;ll have to hurry . 
and what are we looking for ? 
and bourne ?  where &apos;s he now ? 
call a mayday into berlin station .  we need snipers ,  dod ,  whatever they got .  snipers ? 
sir .  .  . 
she say what time i should call ? 
you put a four - gam kel on here and it &apos;s gonna take out power to the building .  you know that .  what you can &apos;t know ,  is if it &apos;s gonna blow the room with it . 
of all the people in the world ,  you &apos;re the only one i have anything to offer .   that &apos;s why i came here . 
it &apos;s nice .   does this picture mean anything to you ?   hmm ? 
because you &apos;re afraid ! 
you &apos;re lying .  if it &apos;s over ,  why are they after me ? 
i &apos;ll get the book . 
you &apos;re sure ?   we should still  -  -  we should write it down . 
 -  -  it hasn &apos;t been two years  -  - 
we write them down because sooner or later you &apos;re going to remember something good . 
i &apos;m trying ,  marie ,  okay ? 
i love you ,  too . 
and you got to him before we could . 
for treadstone .  in berlin .  you know my file .  i did a job here .  when ? 
okay ,  how do you want to do it ? 
don &apos;t need it .  i remember everything . 
you didn &apos;t answer my question . 
 -  -  who ?   -  -  who else is here ?   -  - 
i want that area secured ,  i want any evidence secured and i want it done now .  is that clear ?  ? 
i &apos;m curious about bourne .  your interpretation of his condition .  you have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions ? 
not good enough .  you &apos;re the person who floated this amnesia story .   ever feel sorry for him ?  for what he &apos;d been through ? 
here &apos;s what i &apos;ve got .   remember vladimir neski ?  russian politician ?  seven years ago ,  he was due to speak to a group of european oil ministers here at the hotel .  he never did .  he was murdered . 
then we &apos;ll just have a peek at the wounds .   dig  &apos;em up ! 
may he rest in peace .  .  .  you have already sealed the coffin ? 
longshanks promised ! 
test of manhood . 
you &apos;ll move
all right ,  father ,  i &apos;ll ask him !   if i risk my neck for you ,  will i get a chance to kill englishmen ? 
i am the one who is rotting .  but i think your face looks graver than mine . 
i do not confess . 
your father doesn &apos;t like me ,  does he ? 
you &apos;ve been here before ? 
but i won &apos;t give you up to any nobleman . 
i need you so much !  i love you ! 
knowing his passion for his lost love ,  they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife .  he fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place !  now that is romance ,  oui ? 
i am the princess of wales . 
i understand you have suffered .  i know .  .  .  about your woman . 
war finds me willing .  i know it won &apos;t bring back all i have lost .  but it can bring what none of us have ever had  -  -  a country of our own .  for that we need a king .  we need you . 
we can &apos;t stop ! 
thank you for showing it to me first .  i &apos;ll .  .  .  i &apos;ll take care of it .  can i have the picture ? 
actually ,  these tests weren &apos;t available twenty years ago . 
now your father may seem sleepy to you ,  but that &apos;s just because of his medicine ,  okay ? 
i .  .  .  i blacked out . 
please ,  mom .  people will talk . 
did da  -  -  jason  -  -  -  get good grades ? 
why do you ask ? 
 .  .  . i spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal .  he &apos;s sure he can get you off on self - defense ,  so if you &apos;re patient . 
okay ,  doc .  what &apos;s the damage ?  how much time have i got ? 
how .  did you .  know that ? 
you &apos;re religious carlos ,  you believe that bit about  &quot; the lord works in mysterious ways ?  &quot; 
just tell me if anything weird happens . 
go on .  nothing can hurt you .  remember ,  this is only a movie .  you &apos;re completely safe . 
the car doesn &apos;t vanish evan .  the movie in your head has broken ,  that &apos;s all .  but now i &apos;ve re - spliced it and i want you to tell me about the car . 
i never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so i wanted to wear my clothes but mr .  miller took his shirt off  -  - 
whasamatter ?  lost your rolex ? 
ouch . 
it &apos;s my fault .  i should have told you he was released a few weeks ago . 
it &apos;s not his fault ,  evan .  you knew how bad he had it when we were kids . 
i &apos;ve seen some sickening shit .  i don &apos;t blink twice anymore ,  especially in your case . 
let me ask you a question .  just a little one that &apos;s been gnawing at me for years . 
i &apos;m the only person you &apos;ve told ?  that &apos;s a great line .  does that make other girls swoon ?  do they actually eat up this bullshit ? 
anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that . 
you can &apos;t play god ,  son .  it must end with me .  just by being here ,  you may be killing your mother . 
whoa !  didn &apos;t mean to scare you ,  evan .  just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming . 
what do you need it for ?  i don &apos;t get you lately . 
what did i say about mentioning that bitch ? 
lenny ?  come on ! 
go back to bulgaria . 
such a bargain .  but that is your decision ? 
the police break up our meeting .  herr rick !  we escaped in the last moment . 
i want you to take miss lund home . 
excuse me ,  monsieur rick ,  but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs .  the cashier would like some money . 
if i could lay my hands on those letters ,  i could make a fortune . 
i will stay here and keep on trying .  i &apos;m sure in a little while  -  - 
rick ? 
that is also true ,  except for one destination ,  to return to occupied france . 
uh huh .  under a safe conduct from me . 
not an easy day to forget . 
i &apos;m sorry i was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night . 
well ,  you can tell me now .  i &apos;m reasonably sober . 
you use  &quot; richard &quot;  again ?  we &apos;re back in paris . 
richard ,  richard ,  we loved each other once .  if those days meant anything at all to you  -  - 
no .  oh ,  richard ,  i &apos;m sorry .  i &apos;m sorry ,  but ,  but you ,  you are our last hope .  if you don &apos;t help us ,  victor laszlo will die in casablanca . 
 -  -  all right .  i tried to reason with you .  i tried everything .  now i want those letters .  get them for me . 
maybe not today ,  maybe not tomorrow ,  but soon ,  and for the rest of your life . 
it &apos;s been a long time . 
he does .  could we have a table close to him ? 
whatever i &apos;d say ,  you &apos;d carry on .  victor ,  why don &apos;t you tell me about rick ?  what did you find out ? 
you must know it &apos;s very important i get out of casablanca .  it &apos;s my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement .  you know what i have been doing .  you know what it means to the work ,  to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that i be free to reach america and continue my work . 
my friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record .  you ran guns to ethiopia .  you fought against the fascists in spain . 
i know a good deal more about you than you suspect .  i know ,  for instance ,  that you are in love with a woman .  it is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman .  the first evening i came here in this cafe ,  i knew there was something between you and ilsa .  since no one is to blame ,  i ,  i demand no explanation .  i ask only one thing .  you won &apos;t give me the letters of transit .  all right .  but i want my wife to be safe .  i ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from casablanca . 
no .  it &apos;s all arranged . 
everything in order ? 
i am captain renault ,  prefect of police . 
my bill . 
ricky ,  you &apos;re becoming quite human .  i suppose we have to thank you for that ,  mademoiselle . 
i am delighted to see you both .  did you have a good night &apos;s rest ? 
very well ,  herr laszlo ,  we will not mince words .  you are an escaped prisoner of the reich .  so far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us .  you have reached casablanca .  it is my duty to see that you stay in casablanca . 
you may find the climate of casablanca a trifle warm ,  major . 
good evening ,  gentlemen . 
you see ,  major ,  you have nothing to worry about rick . 
what is the meaning of that phone call ? 
why do you stand here ?  why don &apos;t you stop him ? 
the plane to lisbon .   you would like to be on it ? 
my health .  i came to casablanca for the waters . 
you know ,  rick ,  we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the blue parrot ,  but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here .  it will amuse your customers . 
rick ,  that is the first time i have ever seen you so impressed . 
it is my duty to see that he doesn &apos;t impress the other half .  rick ,  laszlo must never reach america .  he stays in casablanca . 
this is the end of the chase . 
yeah ,  you were saying ? 
how can you close me up ?  on what grounds ? 
 -  -  what makes you think i &apos;d stick my neck out for laszlo ? 
you &apos;re not very subtle ,  but you are effective .  i ,  i get the point .  yes ,  i have the letters ,  but i intend using them myself .  i &apos;m leaving casablanca on tonight &apos;s plane ,  the last plane . 
and i &apos;m taking a friend with me .  one you &apos;ll appreciate . 
ilsa lund .   that ought to put your mind to rest about my helping laszlo escape .  the last man i want to see in america . 
sam &apos;s piano . 
well ,  rick ,  you &apos;re not only a sentimentalist ,  but you &apos;ve become a patriot . 
it might be a good idea for you to disappear from casablanca for a while .  there &apos;s a free french garrison over at brazzaville .  i could be induced to arrange a passage . 
are you one of those people who cannot imagine the germans in their beloved paris ? 
oh ,  nothing .  but when you first came to casablanca ,  i thought  -  - 
ain &apos;t you planning on going to bed in the near future ? 
please ,  boss ,  let &apos;s go .  ain &apos;t nothing but trouble for you here . 
thirsty . 
what are you doing ? 
use the sail for a sea anchor and you won &apos;t move . 
it &apos;s a fucking soccer ball ,  you idiot . 
hmmm .   feels like it might have gotten wet . 
our apologies that it never made it to the recipient . 
to tell you the truth  -  -  you did .

your eyes are puffy .   did you take valium again ? 
i can &apos;t even keep fish alive .

i love you ,  chuck .

what do you expect ,  from the guy who stole a kid &apos;s bicycle when his truck broke down ?

this is *your* life story ,  wilbur !  you just changed the dates ! 
he *sniffs* that ether !  i &apos;ve seen him do it ! 
and that i can drive a truck ! 
so ,  mrs .  .  . 
i &apos;ve never seen a lobster . 
people watched the movies in their cars ? 
and what did she die of ,  exactly ? 
at least you were never lonely .

*what* will be okay ? 
no !  that &apos;s not all there is to it !  i love you ,  too -  - i *know* i do .

you can trust me .  is it jack ?  it &apos;s not jack ,  is it ?  it &apos;s *muddy* !  is it muddy ? 
you &apos;ve been giving him a *flying* lesson ! 
i thought they might take me . 
her temperature is a hundred and four . 
did you know your mother better ? 
what &apos;s a nanny do ? 
homer .  .  .  doesn &apos;t king kong think the woman is his *mother* ? 
they wouldn &apos;t take me .  i &apos;m class iv -  -  i &apos;ve got a heart defect . 
they &apos;re migrants . 
i &apos;m stayin &apos; ,  homer . 
i presume you &apos;d prefer handling the delivery . 
i thought you took care of this .  it always breaks in the same place .  it &apos;s your splice ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
doubtless you &apos;ll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do . 
i don &apos;t need this -  - i know all about my condition . 
what i mean is .  .  .  i would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here ,  homer . 
rose rose ? 
there &apos;s a little something wrong with it .  just this part here -  - the right ventricle .  it &apos;s slightly enlarged . 
you &apos;re not yet three months ,  are you ? 
i know more than i want to know about it .  who &apos;s the father ? 
you can &apos;t think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow* -  -  have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is ? 
i fail to see how a little christianity could *hurt* anyone here ! 
you pickin &apos; nothin &apos; but cider apples ,  peaches -  - i hope you understand that . 
where &apos;s your manners ?  make room for homer ,  so &apos;s he can enjoy the view . 
that what happen -  - you lost you only daughter so &apos;s you killed yourself !  that &apos;s what we say ,  all right . 
yeah ,  you really showed him ,  daddy -  -  you just about cut your own hand off ,  and all you cut off *him* was his clothes ! 
my name &apos;s grant .  grant ashby .

you laugh now ,  but wait until you need a clean place to powder .  this is new york city ,  sister .  public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda .  you know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob ?  let &apos;s do the list .  .  .  hepatitis ,  influenza ,  the flesh eating disease  -  - 
buddy ,  that was business .  besides ,  you have more crew .  then there &apos;s you .  .  . 
i &apos; ll be honest with you ,  kid .  a grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar d - k - fucking - n - y suit ,  cooler than an eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me ?  first thing i have to ask myself is ,  is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me ?  you tried it once .

look at you .  .  .  you want to go . 
why ?  your mother not breast feed you or something ? 
you have really soft hands .  like a baby &apos;s . 
what about .  .  .

you better hurry .  the police will be here any second .   i don &apos;t really understand my motivation with this .  why am i washing glasses ? 
we &apos;re working for the king . 
we &apos;re getting a little old for running . 
but if you wanna talk about bad luck .  .  . 
what do we do ?  we change the scam ? 
i know it &apos;s policy ,  but .  .  .   the thing is .  .  .  it &apos;s our first anniversary and we &apos;re only in town for the weekend .  it &apos;s a very ,  very special night for my wife and i .  this ring is my gift to her and i think she &apos;s going to really love it .  i can give you phone numbers to call for people who &apos;ll vouch .  i can send you i . d .  later .  .  . 
sorry .  what ?

preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there ,  bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours .  alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered ,  so you can imagine the smell .  bad for the neighbors ,  good for me because in all the time i &apos;ve been looking for jake ,  this is only the second time i &apos;ve even gotten a whiff of him . 
like we told you before ,  we think he &apos;s into something with the king pin  -  - 
you help me catch him .  whatever he &apos;s into next ,  i want you to be into .  and what you &apos;re into ,  i &apos;m into .  if it all goes well ,  those two guys from iad will never have to hear this tape .  i &apos;ll clear you guys of anything you &apos;ve ever done with vig under the guise of some cross -  departmental investigation .  this prick &apos;s been on the wish list for so long ,  you &apos;ll probably get gold shields out of it . 
good .  .  .  i gotta go .   so ,  what do you have for me ? 
hope so .  those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me .  one fifty every time they tighten those bitches up .  one fifty !  it &apos;s not even covered .

jani ,  there &apos;s something i want to say .  before we get there .  i don &apos;t know what the sleeping arrangements are .  giles probably expects us to share a room . 
i &apos;m in trouble . 
i want to go back to cape town ,  i want to start again ,  clean . 
i want you to forget what i said . 
yes . 
that bruise has cleared up nicely .

there she is .  definite 99% - plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations .  it &apos;ll spiral in toward its sun ,  and  -  - 
it didn &apos;t go off . 
remember what we found ?  fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it .  remember ? 
hey ,  doolittle ,  here &apos;s one .  an unstable planet .  85% probability of an unstable planet in the veil nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star . 
quantum is up thirty - five . 
swell .  let &apos;s synchronize detonation time .  do you know when you &apos;re supposed to go off ? 
you are false data . 
therefore ,  i shall ignore you . 
snap out of it ,  bomb . 
what i &apos;m getting at is this :  the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data .  and this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center . 
new star .   hey ,  guess what ?  i got a new star on the readout . 
yeah .  eight ,  it says here .

the waves at malibu and zuma were fantastic in the springs talby .  i can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit .  .  . 
i really think i should try and locate it immediately .  might be something important . 
lieutenant doolittle ,  this is talby .  lieutenant ? 
i &apos;m going into them ,  i &apos;m going to hit them .  doolittle .  .  . 
yes sir .  negative effect .

you &apos;re attractive ,  you &apos;re smart .   stand on your own two feet ,  know what i mean ?  and you got a wicked sense of humor .  man ,  you really zinged the boss a couple times ,  it was all i could do -  - 
man ,  you got a bad attitude . 
this is what your life &apos;s worth ,  bruno . 
who &apos;s camille ?

trying to have a relationship with you ,  max ,  is like standing in a fog bank .   you know you &apos;re in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are . 
i was crazy about you .  .  . am crazy about you .   but you keep everyone at arm &apos;s length like there &apos;s some great big dark something going on that -  -  i don &apos;t know .  .  .  it &apos;s just that the more i tried to get close to you ,  the more you pulled away . 
what is it ? 
it &apos;s a sweep .   c &apos;mon .

he &apos;s a mistake i made about six months before you did .   but don &apos;t feel bad .  justine made the same mistake ,  along with renee ,  jada ,  tia ,  brooke -  - 
look ,  we gotta keep the momentum up here ,  not give her a chance to think .   if she hears her kid &apos;s voice .  .  . 
who is .  .  . 
so ,  what ,  you just like the sound of your own voice ? 
you miss the good ol &apos; days .   even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn &apos;t have to .  and rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat .   those good ol &apos; days ? 
am i s &apos;posed to be grateful ? 
christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives ,  just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people . 
forty - seven people drowned last night off the coast of vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into canada so they could get work in order to eat .   only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead .

what was she like ? 
you don &apos;t have to love me .  just :  do you believe i love you ? 
blow the third note !  the note to take us home ! 
loki !  where did you come from ?

i &apos;ll tell you what .  .  . 
what about the raping ? 
it &apos;s obvious you haven &apos;t raped anyone in your life . 
i just said i didn &apos;t feel like raping you . 
 &quot; but &quot;  what ?

i remember you turned around .  your face was dark and your hair was backlit  -  -  i could see a halo of frizz  -  -  you asked me if things were okay between naomi and me . 
how are you today ? 
i &apos;m sorry . 
i don &apos;t have one . 
i like it . 
you think that could possibly be a full time job ?  how many hair colors could there be ?

i scoured the city for it . 
i want to enjoy my little time left with you . 
yeah . 
yeah ? 
yeah .  i don &apos;t ever know what to say . 
you should try xanax .  i mean ,  it &apos;s a chemical and all ,  but it works .  .  .  and it works just having it around ,  knowing that it &apos;s there .  like insurance . 
i think ,  before . 
i do sort of live with somebody though . 
bye ,  joel . 
i think i should go back . 
i &apos;m sorry .  i just wanted to say that .  this seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and  -  - 
well ,  sounds like me .  sorry ,  man .   says you were jealous and suspicious . 
doesn &apos;t sound like me . 
says you were constantly calling me a slob .   it &apos;s sexy that we were like a married couple ,  griping and overly - familiar and bored .  don &apos;t you think ? 
ha ha !  you said ,  i do .  i guess that means we &apos;re married . 
i &apos;m just ,  y &apos;know ,  passing the time best i can till i can see you . 
i know .  i had to take the day to think . 
it was snowing . 
clementine . 
gotta get home .  how could she do this to me ?  how could she not care about what we meant to each other .  what a fuck !  what a fucking monster she is ! 
so you &apos;re still on the zoloft ? 
oh ,  hey ,  patrick . 
see you later ,  alligator . 
nietzsche .  beyond good and evil .  found it my bartletts . 
it &apos;s amazing ,  isn &apos;t it ?  such a gift howard gave the world . 
it &apos;s not erasing .  he &apos;s off the screen . 
i don &apos;t know !  i just said that ! 
i don &apos;t know .  i just  -  -  there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office . 
mary .  .  . 
do you like quotes ,  howard ? 
that &apos;s lovely . 
do you love me ?  did you love me ?  something .  i listened to my tape .  i can &apos;t believe i &apos;ve been sitting right in front of it for a year .  it &apos;s like listening to someone else &apos;s story .  i mean ,  i hear myself talking about having sex with you and i can &apos;t even imagine you naked .  i can &apos;t even say  &quot; naked &quot;  to you ! 
well ,  where was patrick ? 
jesus .  all right ,  what &apos;s the address . 
mary .  what are you doing here ? 
so ,  i &apos;ve got to drop the van off . 
does that help ? 
i want to go back to the clock people .  i kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they &apos;re up to .  what &apos;s happened to jelly ? 
no ,  i &apos;m afraid that part isn &apos;t true .  jack was in awe of me and tracked me down .  we spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field ,  but he was hardly my lover .  besides ,  i always travel alone . 
debbie says that if women are to take charge again ,  they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn &apos;t resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods .  she says it is up to women to show themselves better than men ,  to love men ,  set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the new age .  she &apos;s a real dreamer ,  that debbie - dear . 
looks like every time we get together things are in a mess . 
what do you think ? 
for magazines ? 
you &apos;re the best ? 
she &apos;s a young thing who works on my ranch .  real name is sally jones or something wooden like that .  she &apos;s cute as a hot fudge taco ,  and ,  of course ,  it takes verve to change one &apos;s name so charmingly .  but she stinks like a slut just the same . 
but here you are ,  still a virgin  -  -  you are virginal yet ,  aren &apos;t you ? 
yes ,  well ,  what i &apos;m getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity .  she can &apos;t wait too long ,  you know .  now ,  there &apos;s no reason why you must lose yours .  i mean ,  just ponder it a bit ,  that &apos;s all . 
shit !  do not do that !  where the fuck are you ? 
 .  .  . cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission .  .  .  ! 
 .  .  . come on ,  skipper ,  i already put my shoes on .  .  . 
you been out there a long time .  trying to break my record ? 
shit ,  smith ,  you &apos;re going biblical on me . 
it was like .  .  .  nothing was there .  .  .  and then justin appeared and the core .  .  .  became metal .  .  . 
what .  .  .  ? 
he &apos;ll live .  .  .  if we ever make it back . 
what is it ? 
what &apos;s wrong ? 
you wanted to see me ,  admiral ? 
i &apos;ve reached another containment door .  this thing &apos;s huge .  .  . 
jesus its huge . 
i can see the hatch . 
everything &apos;s been shut down .  conserving power ,  i guess .  green light on the hull ,  it &apos;s intact . 
peters .  .  . 
that &apos;s a negative ,  starck . 
captain miller ,  i just want to say .  .  . 
that &apos;s the engineering containment .  and there &apos;s the main airlock .  we can dock there . 
dr .  weir ,  i need you on the bridge . 
it &apos;s 2041 .  .  . 
to what ?  where did this ship go ?  where did you send it ? 
i told you .  .  .  she won &apos;t let you leave .  .  . 
what are you talking about ? 
you can &apos;t have them .  go to hell . 
i guess we &apos;re about to find out .  keep us slow and steady . 
we &apos;ve got some weather . 
1500 meters .  we &apos;re getting too close .  .  . 
proximity warning !  900 ,  800 meters ,  700 .  .  .  we &apos;re right on top of it ,  we &apos;re gonna hit ! 
but .  .  . 
sir .

something &apos;s wrong with the bio - scan . 
i don &apos;t know ,  but whatever it is ,  it &apos;s not the crew . 
if you knew it was impossible ,  then why &apos;d you waste my time ? 
weir can &apos;t be alive . 
we &apos;re armed .  this fucker &apos;s ready to blow .  .  . 
yes ,  we can see some kind of mist .  what is that ? 
about an hour ago .  in medical .  i saw my son .  he was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were .  .  .  
we have to do something ,  oh god .  .  . 
you got any coffee ? 
where is she ? 
jesus ,  that is one big ugly fat fucker .  .  . 
what the hell is that ? 
the safety circuit &apos;s failed ! 
i didn &apos;t see anything and i don &apos;t have to see anything .  this ship is fucked . 
what if the air has gone bad ?  we can &apos;t wear these suits forever . 
that &apos;s how the gravity drive works ,  you see :  it focuses the black hole &apos;s immense gravitational power to create the gateway .  that &apos;s how the event horizon travels faster than light . 
how &apos;d you know it was me ? 
those yours too ? 
we can monitor the cloud &apos;s approach and observe the tests from here . 
i can only stay for one drink ,  ben .  i &apos;ve got to meet with victor . 
where is reed ? 
what about his first born ? 
this is your dream ,  reed .  you should be the one up there . 
how long was i out ? 
glad  &quot; nothing &quot;  could take you away from your work . 
the machine works .  and vic &apos;s gone mister hyde on us  -  - 
i mean ,  you feel a little feverish . 
we should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes .  .  .

they &apos;re ready for you ,  sir . 
leonard ,  how &apos;s the feed ?

those solar winds are flaring ,  but i factored them into my coordinates and  -  - 
for science . 
uh ,  sue .  .  .  ?  i can &apos;t . 
if we can build a machine to re - create the storm ,  we can reverse the polarity  -  - 
and you sure you can control this thing ?  last time didn &apos;t work out so well . 
i could get ben to tap into the baxter &apos;s main power to generate enough voltage  -  - 
remember our first date here .  .  .  ?  god ,  i was so nervous . 
you know ,  i bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late ? 
the power .  .  .  i need .  .  .  more power .  .  .  to control .  .  .  the storm  -  - 
i found a broken gasket ,  from space  -  - 
this isn &apos;t going to be a problem ,  is it ? 
we &apos;ve got minutes until it hits ,  not hours .  .  .  victor ,  that storm &apos;s deadly  -  -  the radiation &apos;s lethal .  we need to abort . 
come on ,  ben ,  come on .  .  . 
didn &apos;t go as planned ?  it was a catastrophe .  you ruined the lives of four people  -  - 
abort ?  reed ,  i put my company ,  my name ,  billions of dollars on the line ,  and i will not let you make me look like a fool  -  - 
it &apos;s just business . 
uh ,  victor ,  i hope i haven &apos;t done something to make you think .  .  . 
please don &apos;t make this personal  -  - 
how much did they cost ? 
tool ?  tool for what ?  we &apos;ve been going together almost two years ! 
well ,  that &apos;s not the way it works ,  really .  and you ate most of your food already ,  too .  .  . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  sir .  just let me find the forms here . 
it &apos;s just some guy i met at swenson &apos;s .  you don &apos;t know him . 
maybe you just need to give her some time .  she &apos;s so nice ,  brad .  everybody loves lisa . 
i don &apos;t know .  i was just curious . 
you are a virgin ! 
does mom know you have company ? 
yeah .  this is it .  i have some shopping to do . 
nice to meet you ,  stacy . 
i can &apos;t wait until i can drive next year .  i walk every day .  it &apos;s such a drag . 
listen .  i feel pretty strange here .  because mark really likes you ,  and he &apos;s my friend . 
what &apos;s wrong ? 
what &apos;s going on ? 
why don &apos;t you call me up tonight ? 
how do you know it &apos;s mine ?  we only did it once . 
did you get her number ? 
i would .  yeah . 
i can see it all now .  this is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at fotomat this summer .  you bought forty bucks of fuckin &apos; film and you never even talked to her . 
okay .  tell me .  what &apos;s the five point plan ? 
and that is how you talk to a girl ,  rat .  voila .  you can &apos;t miss . 
well ,  i &apos;ve gotta be running . 
poor guy . 
if you ask me ,  she &apos;s pretty aggressive .  you understand what i &apos;m saying ? 
how &apos;ve you been ? 
i was going to say .  .  .  your eyes look a little red . 
what &apos;s going through your mind right here ,  jeff ?  the danger of it all ? 
it &apos;s a bunch of jocks in a granada ! 
no there are variables that ,  like ,  i might not be good at . 
like ,  you know ,  giving blow jobs . 
well i never did it . 
you &apos;ll always remember your first time . 
don &apos;t you think it meant anything to him .  even if i am fifteen ? 
i sent a letter to doug today .  i &apos;ll be so glad when he gets out here . 
listen to this .  .  .   &apos;what are your mate &apos;s three most erogenous zones ?  &apos;
wouldn &apos;t penis and balls be the same category ? 
how long does doug take ? 
what do you think ? 
it couldn &apos;t be . 
not coming ?  what happened ? 
sometime ? 
this is u . s .  history ,  right ?  i saw the globe in the window . 
can i come in ? 
i don &apos;t know ,  mon .  the food lines took forever . 
i &apos;m afraid we &apos;ve got some things to discuss here ,  jeff . 
that &apos;s a nice shirt . 
do you have a pen ?  this one &apos;s out of ink . 
do you have mrs .  george for english ? 
where &apos;s your brother ?

mr .  duke ?  hello ,  mr .  duke ,  i &apos;m sorry we were cut off a moment ago .  .  .  i thought i should call again ,  because i was wondering .  .  . 
well ,  certainly .  .  .  we &apos;re always happy to cooperate with the police .  .  . 
what ?  ah .  .  .  yes ,  yes ,  i see what you mean .  .  .  yes .  .  .  so ,  you &apos;ll be responsible then ? 
i didn &apos;t think so .  because in spite of his race ,  this man is extremely valuable to me .  hell ,  i forgot all about this beer .  you want one ?   how about some ether ? 
we &apos;re your friends .  we &apos;re not like the others . 
 .  .  . and we &apos;re chock full of that ! 
savage henry has cashed his check !  we &apos;re going to rip his lungs out ! 
why ? 
holy shit !  they almost had us there !  that was quick thinking . 
i have to go . 
when does this thing stop ? 
what tape ? 
you &apos;re doomed .  i &apos;m leaving here in two hours and then they &apos;re going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps .  right there in that tub . 
of course ,  i &apos;m your attorney ,  i &apos;ll give you all the time you need ,  at my normal rates :  $45 an hour  -  -  but you &apos;ll be wanting a cushion ,  so ,  why don &apos;t you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio ,  and fuck off ? 
i want that fucking radio ! 
you bastard !  i need a lawyer immediately ! 
what ?  fuck telegrams .  i &apos;m in trouble .  you worthless bastard .  i &apos;ll cripple your ass for this !  all that shit in the car is yours !  you understand that ?  when i finish testifying out here you &apos;ll be disbarred ! 
no !  stop talking like that . 
okay ,  lucy ,  it &apos;s time to go meet barbra .  .  . 
man i &apos;ll try about anything; but i &apos;d never touch a pineal gland . 
alright ,  alice .  .  .  you &apos;ll be contacted by inspector rock .  arthur rock .  he &apos;ll be posing as a politician . 
fuck the car .  they should make these things with a goddamn fm radio . 
the dope ring .  you must know what &apos;s going on in this hotel .  why do you think we &apos;re here ? 
maybe she &apos;s telling the truth .  maybe she &apos;s not part of it . 
you know  -  -  i get the feeling you could use a nap .  there &apos;s a rest area up ahead .  why don &apos;t you pull over and sleep a few hours ? 
you &apos;re lying !  you were after the evidence .  who put you up to this  -  -  the manager ? 
we &apos;ll meet in three hours ? 
i have a cb in my truck ,  we could get some help out here . 
they &apos;re right here . 
where &apos;s the tunnel ? 
come on ! 
will i go crazy or something ? 
what ?  really ? 
what &apos;s it for !  ? 
this one will just stun ya ,  but this one will put ya to sleep . 
you are taking a chance that is not worth the risk . 
move it ! 
hey !

what &apos;s wrong ? 
don &apos;t ! 
okay ,  well that &apos;s something . 
go !  go ! 
i admire your strength . 
her name is charlie . 
hey little bear ,  aren &apos;t you going to join the others ? 
what did we say about lying ? 
you know that no one likes a liar ,  right ? 
come on ,  she &apos;s an important columnist !  what &apos;s the matter ?  i thought you wanted these people to forgive you . 
oh .  i mean ,  good . 
i guess so ,  sir . 
look ,  mr .  bebe ,  you can hold me to my contract ,  but you can &apos;t break me .  i &apos;m back ,  and i &apos;m gonna make the best of it . 
well ,  i suppose i should just say it .  it &apos;s your clothes . 
yes ,  but .  .  .  really ,  i hate to sound .  .  .  it &apos;s just that the public expects something different from its stars .  people won &apos;t take you seriously . 
that &apos;s not all ,  frances .  mr .  bebe is very concerned about your politics .  he hears you &apos;ve been donating money ,  speaking at rallies . 
face it !  confess it !  you &apos;re weak ! 
madam .  .  .  ? 
what &apos;s up ? 
hey ,  where &apos;s the fire ,  sister ? 
get your clothes on .

you learn your lines ? 
yeah ,  claire .  she said she was fired .  too bad ,  huh ? 
let &apos;s get out of here !  i &apos;ll lose my job ! 
doctor ,  it may sound odd ,  but i believe i &apos;ve profited from my stay here .  it &apos;s just what i &apos;ve needed ,  to get away like this .  but i &apos;m recuperated now .  i &apos;ve had lots of time to think and i &apos;ve made a few decisions about my life .  i &apos;m ready to get on with it . 
new york ,  frances !  broadway !  this is your chance !  you belong on the stage ! 
it &apos;s already started ,  dad .  .  .  with me . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  i .  .  .  i don &apos;t have a desk in my room ,  and .  .  .  
dad ,  here !  you don &apos;t have to stop ,  just slow down .  you can tell mama i jumped out .  she knows that &apos;s the kind of thing i &apos;d do .  she won &apos;t blame you . 
are you .  .  .  are you hungry ? 
it always amazes me ,  lil ,  how you can whip up a hot ,  hearty meal out of thin air . 
bread ? 
i &apos;m going back to the hotel . 
kurt ! 
address ? 
i &apos;m really sad it &apos;s closing .  now what am i gonna do on tuesday nights ? 
only if you were in it .  are you ? 
hell yes !  .  .  .  well ,  okay ,  i &apos;m still in school .  but as soon as i graduate .  .  .  california ,  here i come ! 
why ? 
oh yeah !  i saw you in the newsreel ! 
i kick myself sometimes ,  but the thing is ,  i would have been miserable living his life . 
you don &apos;t know what you want . 
harry .  .  .  i met someone . 
tell you what .  let &apos;s ditch the limo .  let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up chevy . 
how the hell do you find me anyway ? 
oh my god ,  i look awful . 
i should &apos;ve known .  .  . 
harry ,  i have to go home .  i have to talk to mama . 
aside from meanness ,  you &apos;re almost perfect .  there &apos;s only one other thing wrong with you . 
what a man ! 
i know a thing or two about marriage .  you .  .  .  you understand me more than anyone ,  harry .  .  .  maybe even more than mama .  but .  .  .  you &apos;re too important to me .  i &apos;d fail you .  i don &apos;t know how or why ,  but i would .  and that &apos;s a chance i just can &apos;t take .  do you understand ? 
you give up on her ? 
you don &apos;t need to screw around anymore .  you don &apos;t need dwayne steele or odets or your mother .  you need me . 
been a lot of years ,  you know .  a long time waiting .  for what ?  end up feeling like a sap . 
i got a new car .  only it &apos;s red .  did you know mama died ? 
 .  .  . is that not true ? 
miss farmer !  in light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation ,  coupled with the unwarranted assault on the plaintiff here .  .  .  i am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the county jail . 
i live here . 
 &apos;how do i know it &apos;s true ?  you &apos;ll get to be the champ .  they &apos;ll all want you ,  all the girls !  but i don &apos;t care .  i &apos;ve been undersea a long time .  when they &apos;d put their hands on me i used to say ,   &quot; this isn &apos;t it !  this isn &apos;t what i mean !  &quot;  it &apos;s been a mysterious world for me !  but joe ,  i think you &apos;re it !  i don &apos;t know why ,  i think you &apos;re it .  take me home with you .  &apos;
you think i got it ? 
how long will you be ? 
at one .  promise ? 
i don &apos;t want you drinking ,  frances . 
don &apos;t .  .  .  talk crazy . 
no ! 
where are you going ? 
you &apos;re not going anywhere ! 
oh ,  just leave those things for now . 
yes .  .  .  ? 
i don &apos;t believe so . 
i find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance . 
oh !  are you really ? 
no ,  you stay calm ,  doctor !  but you &apos;re finding that difficult ,  aren &apos;t you ?   why ,  are you attracted to me ?  perhaps later ,  in some of our more intimate sessions .  .  .  after we know each other a little better .  .  .   and you &apos;ve torn my personality to shreds ,  and i &apos;m weeping and vulnerable .  .  .   then you &apos;ll really get your kicks ,  won &apos;t you ,   &quot; doctor ?  &quot; 
is there something else ? 
huh ? 
it can &apos;t be as bad as that . 
more to the point ,  why am i here ?  what did you want with me ?   what does one say to one &apos;s maker ,  having finally met him face to face ?  milton gave it voice .   did i request thee ,  maker ,  from my clay to mould me man ?  did i solicit thee from darkness to promote me ? 
your crime .  .  .  as well as mine . 
she &apos;s beautiful . 
elizabeth ,  really !  he &apos;s quite mad ! 
must &apos;ve been a terrible row . 
what does it say ? 
how could all my father &apos;s knowledge and skill fail to save her ? 
victor ,  have a care !  you &apos;ll make him dizzy ! 
don &apos;t listen ,  willie .  progress is a feast to be consumed .  women would have you believe you must walk before you can run .  or run before you can waltz ! 
victor .  i love you , 
my mind was not playing tricks .  he was there in the storm .  .  .  gloating over his crimes .  .  .  challenging me to come . 
do you know this man ?  is there something between you ? 
what of our marriage ?  victor ,  we &apos;ve had so much tragedy .  i want this family to live again . 
i &apos;m convinced .  not by treating symptoms ,  but by diving nature &apos;s most jealously - guarded secrets . 
rich old ladies and their daughters ? 
the entire school heard it .  it wasn &apos;t something one could miss . 
only you would think of that ! 
they just caught the man who did it . 
they &apos;ll hang him all the same . 
it &apos;s the down - and - outs i pity most .  those who can &apos;t fend for themselves .  they &apos;ll be dead by the thousands before this is done .  they don &apos;t stand a chance out there . 
are you sure you &apos;ll be all right ? 
yes .  i took refuge in the barn .  wouldn &apos;t you ?  lost in the storm ?  freezing and wet ?  i was exhausted and could search no longer . 
i have always loved him . 
ah .  an explorer . 
creature ?  a .  .  .  human like creature ? 
he &apos;s dead .  .  .  she &apos;s dead .  .  .  all dead .  .  .  please save me .  .  .  oh .  .  .  poor bill .  .  .  oh my god ,  oh my god .  .  .  oh god .  .  .

holy shit .  .  . 
what about the dope paragraph in mr .  christy &apos;s letter ? 
steve taught me how to use the emergency generator .  the town power lines are supposed to be real shitty . 
don &apos;t call him . 
like waves .  it &apos;s never been likes waves before . 
bad enough we got a full moon; it &apos;s friday the 13th .  they keep statistics .  we get more accidents ,  more robberies ,  more rapes ,  more homicides ,  more of everything when there &apos;s a full moon .  it affects people .  makes  &apos;em nuts . 
no ,  but i passed by it a couple of times .  it &apos;s out in the middle of nowhere .  it seems like a rowdy place ,  so there wouldn &apos;t be a lot of police .  and it &apos;s open from dusk till dawn .  you said meet you in the morning . 
it &apos;s okay ,  honey .  everything &apos;s going to be all right . 
where are the keys to the motor home ?

who else ? 
to your family .

okay ,  does anybody here know what &apos;s going on ? 
did he .  .  .  ? 
it &apos;s the bitterest of pills . 
i didn &apos;t want to talk about this in front of scott because he gets upset .  but you don &apos;t believe in god anymore ? 
it &apos;s not a flop house .  it &apos;s basic and simple .  that doesn &apos;t make it a flop house . 
it has a bed .  that &apos;s all i care about . 
you &apos;re gonna be okay ,  aren &apos;t you ,  daddy ? 
i &apos;m going for  &apos;em !

do you believe me ? 
i &apos;m really sorry .

for the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty - eight hours .  the bureau ,  local law enforcement and the texas rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare seth and richard gecko . 
what the hell would i do with that grease pit ?  besides ,  nadine &apos;s got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head .  then all this abilene shit happened .  you heard about that bank robbery in abilene ,  didn &apos;t ya ?

my shit is together . 
well ,  then ask her ,  dumb ass . 
they take you away to san clemente island .   half the guys quit when they come back .   supposed to be just hell - and - a - half . 
the woman i saw you with .  .  . 
because i was civil ,  now you &apos;re complaining . 
did you just have a brain - fart ? 
straight up ? 
i ain &apos;t gonna shoot her . 
banditos on the east perimeter !   150 yards !   shit ,  she was part of it ! 
the navy &apos;s conclusion regarding the crash of an f - 14 aboard an aircraft carrier .   female aviator ,  it just so happens .   you &apos;re familiar with this report and its conclusion ,  am i right ? 
captain dwyer .   technically . 
uh ,  question ,  ma &apos;am . 
uh ,  ma &apos;am . 
jordan .   i always hoped we &apos;d get together  -  -  though just now i &apos;m gearing up for a child - care vote that  -  - 
should probably ask him that . 
don &apos;t have to use it ,  o &apos;neil ,  but it &apos;s gotta go out .   five .  .  .  four .  .  .  three .  .  . 
just do it ,  okay ? 
i &apos;ve had it .   just because they pay me like a baby - sitter doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m gonna be one . 
i &apos;ll try anyway ,  sir . 
unless you whiskey run . 
you expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare - back ?   is that correct ,  o &apos;neil ? 
i &apos;ll try to keep the door open .   if you wash out ,  i make it so that  -  - 
so why are you telling me this ? 
you know ,  royce ,  i got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets ,  too . 
still can &apos;t make up your mind ,  huh ?  gotta go ,  royce . 
 &quot; in washington .  .  .  &quot; 
hey .   way to gut it out . 
o &apos;neil ? 
chief ,  sir ,  i don &apos;t understand why  -  - 
o &apos;neil .  .  .

aw ,  lookit this ,  lookit this  -  -  she &apos;s bringin &apos; tampax in here .  c &apos;mon ,  you got nothin &apos; but rooms over there . 
this ain &apos;t workin &apos; right ! 
thought you two were file - closed . 
the white house .   if jordan wins ,  dehaven wins in spades .   why ?   well ,  it &apos;s been said that the only man the president fears  -  -  ain &apos;t no man . 
don &apos;t for a second think she didn &apos;t leak this story .    &quot; g . i .  jane &quot;  gives dehaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all . 
if you were the president ,  wouldn &apos;t that put a little piss in your shoes ? 
okay ,  so now work it from the other end .   think about california  -  -  and how things might be handled there . 
what ? 
he stole my report !  that &apos;s my report ! 
what are you doing ? 
you &apos;re still mad at me ,  aren &apos;t you ? 
and you think this creature is one of them ? 
circuits are overloaded . 
i can &apos;t believe he put the moves on me .  after everything i &apos;ve done for him . 
your old sweetheart ? 
i want that story ,  audrey .  remember you work for me . 
they didn &apos;t make it . 
chargeures ,  property and casualty insurance .  we are preparing a report . 
dr .  niko topopolosis ? 
what sample ? 
it &apos;s the french secret service . 
here .  23rd street subway station .  where we first found the fish .  with a little luck ,  this will lead us right to it . 
dr .  lazarus ,  here is your surface mapper .   i have programed it to the coordinates of a beryllium sphere of sufficient density . 
good luck on your mission ,  sir .  by grabthar &apos;s hammer ,  by the suns of warvan i wish you - 
god ,  what an ass . 
go ahead ! 
what ?   what ? 
alexander ?  ?  ?  please ?  you &apos;re my advisor ,  advise me ! 
it &apos;s a damn rock monster !  !  !  it doesn &apos;t have motivation ! 
hundreds dead ,  all so you could play at being the commander .  &apos; you &apos;ve murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch ! 
what the hell is going on ?  !  !  ? 
he wants to think !  ? 
could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one ! 
this is ludicrous .   why are you listening to this man ?   must i remind you that he is wearing a costume ,  not a uniform ?  .  .  .   he &apos;s no more equipped to lead us than this fellow .   no offense . 
oh alex ,  get away from that thing .  .  . 
alex you can &apos;t  - just leave . 
we heard it the first time ! 
those blue things ate everybody here ? 
he always has to make the big entrance . 
yes but ,  we were wondering - 
what does the omega 13 do ? 
how did you come to that conclusion ? 
shit !  go ! 
systems register functional . 
hey commander .  listen ,  we found some beryllium on a nearby planet .  we might be able to get there if we re - configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion .  what do you think ? 
a hologram .  .  . 
it &apos;s suicide . 
oh ,  they &apos;re so cute . 
this isn &apos;t mine .  wait ,  where is that kid ?  .  .  . 
you &apos;re playing your good side . 
all right .  .  .  here &apos;s the plan :   first ,  fred ,  we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound ,  then gwen ,  alex ,  fred and i go down to get the sphere .   any of those things come back ,  give a signal .  guy ,  you set up a perimeter . 
we shouldn &apos;t have to do this !   it makes no logical sense !  why is it here ? 
you gotta admit ,  they do love him . 
we got the sphere but the commander &apos;s down there with a bunch of cannibals !   teb ,  reset the pod ,  we &apos;re going back . 
my name is jason nesmith .  i &apos;m an actor .  we &apos;re all actors . 
a thousand apologies .  we have failed you . 
could be this . 
i &apos;m accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property . 
why in hell would john do that ?  why in hell would any of them do that ?   after all you &apos;ve done ,  it &apos;s unbelievable ! 
they &apos;re ready .   believe me ,  the ones that stayed on here at valley forge are ready for anything .   of course ,  we get nothing from congress .   they need boots ,  coats .  .  .  we desperately need food . 
have you heard ?   the british are negotiating to make a trade for general lee . 
wil ,  i want to remind you of a conversation we started just before monmouth .  .  . 
by red ,  what rank would you say this black ,  officer ,  soldier is ,  colonel ? 
who is that !  ? 
how old are you ,  captain ? 
that young school teacher .  .  .  i heard the british hung him as a spy . 
yessir . 
sir ,  i think no such thing . 
sir ,  arnold is a traitor . 
i want to address the officers ,  all the officers .   next friday .   can we arrange it at the mess ? 
well ,  john adams ,  your cousin has a marvelous gift . 
oh ,  come now .  .  . 
did god ever make such a pitiful army ? 
arnold is indispensable ,  do you understand ?   i need arnold to help me win this war ! 
 &apos;charming little victories ?  &apos; please don &apos;t expect much more of us ,  monsieur . 
these supplies .  .  .  ? 
like flowers after the snow melts . 
that &apos;s right .  .  . 
to win this war i need an army . 
what &apos;s the point of a revolution if it doesn &apos;t ? 
leave me ,  now sir ,  i am tired . 
general greene ? 
they &apos;re just disgusting ,  jealous ,  bottom - feeding swine .   it &apos;s their nature . 
and what is this ,  then ?   been off to fight the french because you are a patriot ?   or is this you ,  gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war !  ? 
africa ?   that &apos;s so far ?   how do they get here ? 
capture them ?   well ,  i &apos;ve never seen anything like it ,  so .  .  .  of course i &apos;m curious . 
the word  &apos;minuet &apos; finds its source in minitus ,  which is latin meaning  &apos;small &apos; or  &apos;orderly &apos; . 
i always though london was the place to be :   capital of the world ,  the most spectacular city on earth . 
what are you doing ? 
all people have rights ! 
i say ! 
and  &apos;others &apos; ,  say .  .  .  have you even read locke ,  vattel ,  voltaire ,  diderot .  .  . 
you get life for kidnapping . 
about sixty . 
you gave him the money ? 
maybe your nephew panicked ,  took off . 
what &apos;s this movie you &apos;re doing first ? 
but first i want to know who i &apos;m talking to .  am i talking to you ,  or am i talking to him ? 
harry called you his associate ,  but what does that mean ?  i never heard your name or read it in variety or the reporter or anyplace . 
she &apos;s .  .  .  young . 
the three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named leo . 
he was watching letterman ,  huh ?  sneaky ,  that chili palmer .   so ,  he ever find this dry cleaner ,  the one with all that money on him ? 
the airport . 
ray barboni ? 
hello ?  you there ? 
harry zimm .  the man happens to be a major hollywood player . 
why would i do that ? 
by the way ,  you recall the number of the locker you used ? 
guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand ,  sixty days over; a movie producer . 
i &apos;m looking at you . 
dick allen &apos;s a very dear friend of mine .  how far you want to go with this ? 
operator ,  how do i get las vegas information ? 
part of it ,  yeah . 
i &apos;m not the guy ,  harry . 
these guys ,  my investors ,  they run a limo service ,  came to me originally ,  put money in a few of my pictures and did okay ,  they &apos;re happy .  so they come in on another deal  -  this was back a few months ago when i was planning what would be my next picture ,  about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake .  the characters ,  there &apos;s this seven -  hundred - pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys ,  gets them in her trailer  - 
she looks familiar . 
anyway ,  murray has this shrink ,  who also happens to be martin &apos;s personal trainer &apos;s shrink .  murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to martin &apos;s trainer who reads it to martin while they work out ,  and martin flips .  loves it . 
that ,  or i &apos;m thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow saffrin  - 
you don &apos;t even know these guys . 
what do you get out of this ? 
that &apos;s the difference between you and me ,  harry .  i say what i mean .  i want something from someone ,  i ask  &apos;em straight out .  i want martin weir ,  i go get martin weir .  i don &apos;t fuck around with his trainer &apos;s shrink . 
it was in the herald . 
how about this ? 
the wife sues the airline .   this is a gutsy babe . 
what &apos;s that ? 
i wouldn &apos;t think you &apos;re that dumb ,  leave over three hundred grand in the closet ,  underneath the extra blanket ,  but i guess you are . 
how ?  by taking my money ? 
but you won &apos;t know where i am .  i don &apos;t even know where i &apos;ll be . 
it &apos;s not one of these ? 
yeah .  it &apos;s a real gift .   i &apos;m just saying it &apos;d be nice ,  one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line .  you know ,  like in that bette davis picture ,   &quot; cabin in the .  .  .  &quot; 
i think it &apos;s not horrible . 
then you &apos;ve read it ? 
that was martin .  he wants to have lunch tomorrow .  that is ,  if you can make it . 
yeah ? 
you sure ? 
hey ,  chili .   get your coat ,  but don &apos;t piss the guy off ,  okay ?  it could get complicated and we &apos;d have to call momo to straighten it out .  then momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don &apos;t need that . 
i hate to say i told you ,  but i did .  i told you don &apos;t start nothing with him that time . 
all these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene . 
yeah ,  what &apos;d he have to say ? 
how did you get in the house ? 
lufkin .  his .  .  .  agent . 
i have to consider ,  i mean ,  as the mob guy ,  this is another man &apos;s wife i &apos;m sleeping with . 
yeah ,  but not as cold as those swedish girls you only gonna dream about . 
what day is it ? 
where from ? 
maureen . 
light in those passages ain &apos;t so good . 
try wednesday . 
get up . 
you aren &apos;t jealous ,  are you dodge ? 
what the hell would a freighter be doing up here ?  it &apos;s way out of the lanes .  there &apos;s not a port for 800 miles . 
yeah ,  from one side of the harbor to the other .  but we got half the bering sea and the whole alaskan gulf to drag her over . 
but how long ? 
how long ? 
obviously it &apos;s some kind of screw up .  the shipping records aren &apos;t a hundred percent accurate . 
if somebody &apos;s aboard her already ,  she ain &apos;t ours .  she &apos;s theirs . 
bodies &apos;re too fresh . 
there &apos;s no way we &apos;re gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the coastguard here .  besides ,  it &apos;ll be safer where it is . 
just what the hell do you think you &apos;re doing ?  ! 
i think you know . 
morning everybody . 
you mean ,  before she sank . 
stay away .  or else . 
any dizziness ? 
what ? 
what &apos;d you find up there ? 
she was a two - masted brig boat sailing out of new york in 1872 .   one day she was sighted off the coast of portugal by a merchant vessel ,  the dei gratia .  as the crew of the dei gratia got closer ,  they discovered that no one was at the helm of the mary celeste .  on boarding ,  they found her completely deserted .  the captain ,  his wife ,  their daughter ,  and the entire crew ,  all gone .  the last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble .  the table was even set for dinner .  and in the nine days after the last entry ,  she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard . 
you sure it wasn &apos;t me ? 
he needs a doctor . 
 &quot; the crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill .  &quot; 
hey . 
they went crazy . 
it &apos;s a trap .  there was no way we were gonna get away with that gold .  nobody ever does .  it &apos;s just the bait .  this ship sucks people in and it never lets them out . 
too deep to anchor out there . 
yeah ,  but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to sitka . 
pretty low all around . 
ho - ly shit . 
greek citizen .  merchant navy .   obviously we aren &apos;t the first to come across this ship .  they probably stumbled across it just like we did . 
maybe epps &apos;s mystery man had something to do with it . 
never been more thirsty in my life . 
can &apos;t find the shotgun . 
now hold up just a minute .  let &apos;s be reasonable here . 
as i said ,  what seems to be the trouble ? 
i thought you say tuesday . 
did i tell you who i ran into at the bagel place ? 
give up ? 
yup . 
it &apos;s nothing  -  -  it &apos;s just some hormonal thing .  .  .  don &apos;t worry about it .  .  . 
what ? 
what &apos;s wrong with you ?  !  tell him i &apos;m not here ! 
uh ,  well ,  that &apos;s okay  -  i don &apos;t dance ,  heh ,  heh .  .  . 
seymour ?  .  .  .  uh .  .  .  hello .  .  .  i guess i &apos;m a little early .  .  . 
i - i honestly never intended for this to happen .  .  . 
enid ,  can i talk to you for a minute ? 
that guy rules ! 
so josh ,  will you give us a ride ?  please ?  pretty please ?  it &apos;s going to be super fun ! 
aren &apos;t there a million places like this ? 
jesus ,  look at this guy . 
hi josh . 
are you the one who left that note ? 
you make me nervous !  i always feel like you &apos;re going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me ! 
oh ,  hi .  .  . 
do you want to go get breakfast somewhere ? 
remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year ?  i didn &apos;t think that just because you get an  &quot; f &quot;  that means you have to take the class over again . 
just think ,  we &apos;ll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again . 
jesus !  listen to this one :   &quot; do you remember me ?  airport shuttle ,  june 7th .  you :  striking redhead with yellow dress ,  pearl necklace ,  brown shoes .  i was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens .  am i crazy ,  or did we have a moment ?  &quot; 
i know .  and he &apos;s like psychotically obsessing over every little detail . 
i want to do him ! 
god ,  i think josh is too mature for us . 
look ,  maybe that &apos;s him ! 
just promise you &apos;ll do it . 
waiting for the bus that never comes .  .  . 
how about this ? 
let &apos;s get out of here ,  this place makes me sick . 
i know a party we could go to .  .  . 
anthony &apos;s ii ! 
that rules ! 
you &apos;re gross .   see that guy ? 
haven &apos;t you heard about the miracle of masturbation ? 
what are you talking about ?  what kind of loser gets fired after one day ?  ! 
hello ? 
what happened to seymour ? 
just some people from work .  .  . 
i just mean it &apos;s weird to me .  .  .  i &apos;ve never been anywhere near here in my life . 
why ?  what did he say ? 
when was this ? 
hi . 
we &apos;re not . 
my acting workshop is across the street from here .  i &apos;m just on my break . 
how much is this ? 
i hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago .  .  .  there are no buses on this street . 
do you have any old indian records ? 
is this one any good ? 
this track alone by memphis minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78 .  she was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived ,  and a great singer and songwriter as well .  i know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue . 
how much is it ? 
you &apos;re right about that .   so this is your record collection ? 
i &apos;m talking to you .  .  .  i &apos;ll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute ! 
okay ,  what about this one ?  are you into girls with big tits ? 
so is that your boyfriend ? 
yes ,  that would certainly do .  .  . 
actually ,  i was a whole lot more interested in the cook &apos;s phenomenon when i was about your age .  i &apos;ve kind of lost interest since i &apos;ve been working for them .  .  . 
hey ,  i get good benefits ,  a good early retirement plan ,  nobody ever bothers me .  .  . 
so ,  i don &apos;t really get it  -  -  are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this ? 
you can open your eyes now . 
arrrghhh !  ah jeez .  .  .  christ .  .  . 
actually ,  i &apos;ve got a total crush on this one guy right now ,  but it &apos;s a really fucked - up situation .  .  . 
wow !   what was that all about ? 
seymour !  i promise you that wasn &apos;t a joke  -  -  you have to call her back ! 
uh .  .  .  hello ? 
no ,  actually joe told me you were here .  .  .  so how come you never call me anymore ? 
of course you should .  c &apos;mon ,  i &apos;m already a million hours late . 
well ,  you know .  .  .  what do i know about clothes .  .  .  i &apos;ve never been the most fashionable guy  -  -  it &apos;s nice to have someone do all the work for me .  .  . 
i .  .  .  i don &apos;t think so . 
no ,  of course not . 
god ,  she &apos;s going to kill me .  .  .  this bottle is half - empty ! 
if you expect the worst ,  you &apos;re never disappointed . 
i &apos;m serious !  i &apos;m just so sick of everybody !  why can &apos;t i just do whatever i want ? 
what ?  .  .  .  maybe .  .  .  no .  .  .  i dunno .  .  . 
yeah ,  well .  .  .  me neither .  .  . 
so what &apos;s the story with the two cheerleaders over here ? 
did you remember to pay the phone bill ? 
i can see that .  .  .  now what can you tell us about it ?  first of all ,  what kind of sculpture is this ? 
very good .  now ,  what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent ? 
i don &apos;t know . 
well ,  mostly archival research ,  cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their cd reissues .  it &apos;s really .  .  .  i can &apos;t believe it . 
there is no reason for fear . 
i am a man of peace . 
what ? 
let me explain about time -  you &apos;ve been here three months and already two months behind .  and the germans and the french are gearing up .  and i don &apos;t care about you and i don &apos;t care about the thirty dead -  i care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule ,  i &apos;ll get my knighthood and i want it .   professional hunters may be the answer . 
this sham ?  ridiculous .  who needs it ?  it &apos;s only being built to control the ivory trade ,  make men richer . 
silliest thing i ever heard of -  why in the world should we go through all that ? 
tell me about beaumont -  does he understand how brilliant you are ,  how lucky he is to have you ? 
oh dear -    - you &apos;re geting that downtrodden look again - 
very good indeed . 
not once ?  -  you didn &apos;t hit it once ?  - 
every time i see something like that ,  i know we &apos;re right to be here -  to bring christianity into their lives ,  enrich their souls . 
i hate to be a bother ,  john ,  but the cramp &apos;s getting worse .   the pain is actually quite unbearable now . 
in your honor ,  nigel .  and you and singh will be in charge of building them -  and you &apos;ll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars -  and you &apos;ll be finished in eight thrilling weeks . 
i didn &apos;t have a chance to thank you . 
we need to talk . 
i don &apos;t really .  but understand something -  even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out -    - when i &apos;m gone ,  you &apos;ll still have to build the bridge .  and i don &apos;t want the men to have lost respect for you . 
it would have been a beautiful bridge ,  john .  i never noticed before ,  occupied with other business ,  i suppose .  .  .    .  .  . never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but i &apos;ve had the time today ,  nothing else on ,  and this .  .  .  it &apos;s graceful and the placement couldn &apos;t be prettier .  .  .  and .  .  .  
in my town ,  when i was little ,  there was a brute ,  a bully who terrorized the place .   but he was not the problem .  he had a brother who was worse than he .  but the brother was not the problem .   one or the other of them was usually in jail .  the problem came when they were both free togther .  the two became different from either alone .   alone they were only brutes .  together they became lethal ,  together they killed . 
they &apos;re used to people in trees ,  not in a clearing .   it may be tight . 
i &apos;ll be bait alone ? 
how many do you think they &apos;ve killed ? 
i never thought i &apos;d say this ,  but i &apos;m glad you came . 
it &apos;s all wonderfully under control ,  samuel -  you &apos;ve done a splendid job . 
the workers don &apos;t get on ? 
did it look like this in your mind ? 
soon .  
three years i &apos;ve worked for the railroad .  now i don &apos;t know why .  it seemed a good idea once . 
janosz ? 
we &apos;ll do the happiness index next .   i &apos;d like to bring ray in on your case ,  if it &apos;s all right with you . 
this is my address and telephone number .  will you call me ? 
what do you think ? 
brings back a lot of sweet memories ,  doesn &apos;t it ?   there &apos;s our old cash machine .   and the dry cleaners we used to go to .   and the old video store .   we really had some good times ,  didn &apos;t we ? 
i &apos;m sure you didn &apos;t come here just to talk about art . 
this is joe namath &apos;s old number ,  you know .  you could get a lot of chicks with this .  just don &apos;t pee in it . 
for me it &apos;s best if i sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me .   if we go the other way i &apos;m afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night . 
i &apos;m not here to date .   i can &apos;t leave oscar in a strange place with someone i don &apos;t know . 
all right ,  you want to be real ?   so tell me why did you dump me ? 
that &apos;s not true .   it was 1620 . 
can i help you ? 
i know who you are ,  doctor venkman .   busting any ghosts lately ? 
oh migod !   i &apos;m sorry .   i didn &apos;t mean to do that .   it was an accident . 
so you see ,  everything is in order ,  is it not ? 
i ,  vigo ,  the scourge of carpathia  -  - 
you &apos;ve got to do something ! 
can i have some of your water ? 
so what are you saying ?   that the world of the supernatural is your special province ? 
egon ! 
who ? 
who ?   who ?   who ? 
i love this .   we &apos;re onto something really big .   i can smell it ,  ray .   we &apos;re going to make some headlines with this one . 
you know he ran that last lap in under six minutes ? 
oh good ,  you &apos;re here .   spengler and i have something really amazing to show you . 
beautiful ,  beautiful .   work with me ,  baby .  just have fun with it .   okay ,  he &apos;s playing it cool .   let &apos;s finish up and get out of here . 
forget it .   the vienna boys choir couldn &apos;t get through this stuff . 
i think she looks pretty good here ,  don &apos;t you ? 
what &apos;s your story ,  pete ? 
ready ? 
give it up ,  ray .   you &apos;re living in the past .  ghostbusters doesn &apos;t exist anymore .   in a year these kids won &apos;t even remember who we are . 
she &apos;s moving ! 
my people weren &apos;t taking any pictures from those slave ships ,  man .   and there wasn &apos;t any statue in charleston harbor to welcome them ,  either .   what are you ,  dana ? 
is it a star ? 
i &apos;d have to say prokofiev &apos;s third concerto . 
damn ! 
there &apos;s nothing there now and i don &apos;t get any significant readings . 
on a purely scientific basis . 
he is a very close friend .   do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment ? 
hittites ,   the mesopotamians and the sumerians .    &quot; zuul was the minion of gozer .  &quot; 
i don &apos;t think so .   i &apos;m busy thursday night . 
all right .   since you put it that way . 
hey ,  dana .   what is it ?   what happened ? 
i don &apos;t know .   you &apos;ve got two people in there already .   it could get a little crowded .   i want you to close your eyes and relax .   now i &apos;m going to speak to dana and i want dana to answer . 
that is one speedy mutt . 
hello ,  i &apos;m roger delacorte  -  the head librarian .   are you the men from the university ? 
what &apos;s that got to do with it ? 
why don &apos;t you step into the office and we &apos;ll talk about it .   hold all my calls ,  janine . 
heavens ,  no !   the owners don &apos;t like us to even talk about it .   i hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight . 
and where do you put these ghosts once you catch them ? 
well ,  just 75 more to go .   what &apos;s this one ? 
i &apos;ll tell you the effect !   it pisses me off ! 
trust me .   it will be bad . 
i &apos;m with dana barrett and she &apos;s floating three feet off the bed . 
i don &apos;t think so .   it &apos;s more of that gozer thing .   she says she &apos;s the gatekeeper .   does that make any sense to you ? 
yes .   after the first world war shandor decided that society was too sick to survive .   and he wasn &apos;t alone .   he had close to a thousand followers when he died .   they conducted rituals ,  bizarre rituals ,  intended to bring about the end of the world . 
on the count of three !   one  .  .  .  two  .  .  . 
no !   you said crossing the beams would be bad .   it &apos;ll kill her !   and us ! 
you know ,  peter ,  this could be a past life experience intruding on the present . 
i just realized something .   we &apos;ve never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment . 
set entry grid . 
look at the structure of the roof cap .   it looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker nasa uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies . 
you mean if i stand here and concentrate on the image of roberto clemente ,  gozer will appear as roberto clemente and wipe us out ? 
spengler and i have charted every psychic occurrence in the tri - state area for the past two years .   the graph we came up with definitely points to something big . 
what do you mean by  &quot; seen ?  &quot; 
if you guys are right ,  if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow ,  i think i could win the nobel prize . 
do you know what a patent clerk makes ?   i liked the university .   they gave us money ,  they gave us the facilities and we didn &apos;t have to produce anything !   i &apos;ve worked in the private sector .   they expect results .  you &apos;ve never been out of college .   you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like out there . 
so do i . 
where are we now ,  commodus ?   can you see the camp ?   my gods !   the air is turning into ice ! 
that &apos;s what you told me two days ago ! 
quite so .   narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve rome .  .  . 
i want that bastard dead ! 
i would say there &apos;s nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what  &apos;right &apos; is . 
take grain away from the army ? 
where is my father ? 
you won an impossible fight .   you got the attention of the crowd ,  legate .  .  . 
the emperor and i are bound by the threads of the fates .   he was born on august thirty - first ,  you know . 
the battle was won ,  today ,  and i prefer to believe it was a gift of janus ,  the eldest god of rome .   god of my ancestors . 
would you support the senate if they would give you a trial ?   you &apos;d have to give me your word . 
my loyalties .  .  .  were in doubt . 
you know our two most senior senators :   gaius cantus and falco verus ? 
marcus would have lived but .  .  .  was poisoned by his son . 
commodus ,  it &apos;s we who are going on the offensive . 
i &apos;ve made so many mistakes ,  narcissus .   we all put off the very last duties of our lives because we &apos;re afraid of admitting when our lives are over . 
if i &apos;d ever had a sign that you wanted to rule i would have .  .  .  no ,  again ,  it &apos;s my own bullheadedness .  narcissus ,  i should have adopted you years ago .   and now the gods are begging me to make you my son ! 
the senators admire you . 
this is our oil from our estates ? 
i want to come home ,  of course i do ,  i &apos;d have to be mad not to want that .  it &apos;s just that marcus trusts me . 
they &apos;ll have me .   teach them .   don &apos;t let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history ,  without philosophy ,  without meaning .  teach them of the greeks ,  the babylonians ,  the hebrews ,  the numidians ,  the egyptians and the great romans .   teach them ,  who we are ! 
general ,  do you realize what happened out there today ? 
at the end of the day i was approached by the golden pompeii olive oil company .   small ,  but profitable .   they asked if you would endorse their oil .   we could get some very nice posters .   make some very big money .  .  . 
no more bad luck now !   the people are anticipating you !   i have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior  -  -  the true roman !   the man who fought side by side with the wolf of rome ! 
but  -  -  you have to go out there !  i &apos;ll give you more than your one third !   when i get paid .  .  .  just take the fall !   you &apos;re too hurt to fight and the man &apos;s a killer ! 
is anything wrong ? 
do you ? 
did they ever find out ? 
and it &apos;s all over now . 
okay . 
benjamin  -  -  what &apos;s happening ? 
elaine  -  - 
where are you meeting this person ? 
 -  -  really incredible  -  - 
 -  -  how you  -  -  how anyone  -  -  could do a thing like that . 
what are you going to do now ? 
you won &apos;t ? 
the day after tomorrow ? 
this is dr .  smith &apos;s answering service . 
are you listening ? 
it &apos;s all right ,  mr .  mccleery . 
well here &apos;s the purse . 
benjamin ? 
did you get a room ? 
give me an hour . 
yes sir ? 
where is it ? 
whatever it is you &apos;re upset about . 
what do you drink ?  bourbon ? 
benjamin  -  -  i &apos;m sorry to be this way ,  but i don &apos;t want to be alone in this house . 
well ,  why can &apos;t you just lock the doors and go to bed ? 
sit down ,  benjamin . 
what do you think ? 
for god &apos;s sake ,  mrs .  robinson ,  here we are ,  you &apos;ve got me into your house .  you give me a drink .  you put on music ,  now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won &apos;t be home for hours . 
it &apos;s not all right ,  it &apos;s the worst thing i &apos;ve ever said to anyone . 
if you still think i &apos;m trying to seduce you  -  - 
then why do you keep running away ? 
benjamin  -  -  i want you to know i &apos;m available to you .  if you won &apos;t sleep with me this time  -  - 
do you want me to get it ? 
yes . 
what ? 
well . 
thank you . 
anything .  anything at all . 
oh . 
always ? 
so you don &apos;t love him .  you wouldn &apos;t say you  -  - 
well how do you feel about him ,  then ? 
well that &apos;s kind of a bad situation then ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
i can &apos;t see why you did ,  unless .  .  .  you didn &apos;t have to marry him or anything ,  did you ? 
oh no .  you had to marry him because you got pregnant ? 
well i never thought of you and mr .  robinson as the kind of people who .  .  . 
do you remember the make of the car ? 
do you understand that ? 
good . 
i have my reasons . 
well ,  i &apos;m not . 
because  -  -  mrs .  robinson this is the sickest ,  most perverted thing that ever happened to me .  and you do what you want but i &apos;m getting the hell out . 
drive down the block . 
benjamin ?  i &apos;m going to ask you something but you don &apos;t have to tell me if you don &apos;t want . 
i drive around . 
i do . 
don &apos;t go on like this .  now if benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out  -  - 
i &apos;m going up to berkeley today . 
i drove  -  -  i drove mrs .  robinson home .  she wanted me to drive her home so i  -  -  i drove her home . 
she &apos;s upstairs .  she wanted me to wait down here till you got home . 
thank you . 
you have yourself a few flings this summer .  i bet you &apos;re quite a ladies &apos; man . 
do you have a special grudge against me ?  do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me ? 
i am not threatening you . 
it shouldn &apos;t make any difference what happened . 
the point is  -  -  i don &apos;t love your wife .  i love your daughter ,  sir . 
benjamin  -  -  where are you ? 
they came all the way from tarzana . 
what &apos;s happening ? 
turn  &apos;em up . 
it &apos;s a short life and a gay one .  .  . 
have you a minute now ? 
you are late  -  -  the dancer &apos;s gone to the theatre . 
he must be very nice . 
oh ,  my large and noisy neighbor  -  -  really ?  that ?  
unfortunately no  -  -  to bad  -  -  tomorrow though . 
you live here ? 
poor little grusinskaya !  does it do you good to cry ?  are you afraid ?  shall i go ? 
and then  -  -  ? 
yes  -  -  tired .  .  . 
not quite strange now .  it is as if i had been expecting you .  you know ,  once when the grand duke was alive ,  i found a man hiding in my room  -  -  a young officer  -  - 
go away .  who are you  -  -  ? 
i want to be alone . 
i want to be alone  -  - 
the stage frays one &apos;s nerves .  .  .  the discipline  -  -  it &apos;s so exacting .  discipline means doing what you don &apos;t want to do and take no pleasure in doing .  do you know what i mean ?  have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline ? 
i &apos;ll not denounce you . 
why later ? 
don &apos;t do anything foolish  -  -  i &apos;m alarmed about you . 
bless you .  .  . 
i &apos;m worried about you . 
till then . 
baron ,  we must have gone a hundred miles an hour ,  at least .  .  . 
hello ,  mr .  kringelein .  how do you feel now ? 
a drink ,  baron  -  -  a louisiana flip ? 
all right then . 
you &apos;re all right now  -  -  it &apos;s very late  -  -  goodnight ,  kringelein . 
madam grusinskaya  -  -  at once  -  - 
telegrams ? 
i came here from a long distance to stay at the grand hotel .  i want a room  -  -  a big room  -  -  like you would give general director preysing  -  -  i &apos;m as good as mr .  preysing  -  -  i can pay like mr .  preysing  -  -  would you give him a little room ,  way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going  -  -  bang  -  -  bang  -  -  bang .  .  .  
life is changing you ,  mr .  kringelein . 
well ,  mr .  kringelein ,  are you getting what you &apos;re looking for ? 
a masculine paradise  -  -  drink ,  the ladies ,  dancing .  .  . 
excuse me ,  gentlemen . 
you may laugh .  caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you ,  but to me  -  -  they mean a great deal .  you see ,  i &apos;m ill and all of a sudden i got a fear of missing life .  i don &apos;t want to miss life  -  -  do you understand ? 
her master &apos;s voice !   i must go now  -  -  goodbye  -  -  thanks . 
good evening ,  mr .  kringelein  -  -  where &apos;s the baron ? 
a man might what ?

 .  .  . and let me say again for the tenth time .  .  .    .  .  . you people were quite ready for the merger .  you declared yourselves .  .  .  fully agreed on all the terms  -  -  why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up ? 
nine - thirty ,  mr .  preysing keeps us waiting . 
you &apos;re a deep one . 
good morning ,  suzette . 
madam has slept well ? 
when a lady falls in love she does her hair differently . 
what is this that you have cancelled your car ?  who am i that i should wait like a fool at the door ?  and here on a whim ,  you cancel your car .  have you forgotten there is a performance ?  do you know the time ?  or ,  are we all mad ?  am i your manager ?  .  .  .  have we a contract ?  have we obligations ?  am i blind ?    .  .  . or is that the time ? 
oh !  madam is cancelling the engagement .  madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke .  ha ,  ha ,  ha  -  -  hurry ,  come on .  tonight  -  -  there &apos;s a line in front of the theatre since six o &apos;clock .  the house is jammed to the roof . 
oh  -  -  the baron  -  -  the baron . 
what &apos;s the use of asking ,  gru  -  -  he is at the train  -  -  he will be there . 
how &apos;d you figure you were gonna get away with that ? 
i got a lot of people work for me ,  lilly .  i can &apos;t have shit like this . 
you &apos;re calling the shots . 
it can louse up your insides .  you can get puh ,  puh ,  puh .  .  . 
your kid &apos;s in the back here .  he &apos;s crying . 
come on ,  kid ,  let &apos;s see if there &apos;s any food in the house .

take two ,  three days .  call when you get there . 
i can &apos;t understand a thing like this .  it &apos;s something you almost never see . 
this is some of the finest filigreed platinum i &apos;ve ever seen .  but the stones ,  no .  they &apos;re not diamonds ,  mrs .  langtry . 
whadaya say ? 
kaggs .  home office . 
makes no difference to me if they &apos;re only on commission .  if they don &apos;t make good money ,  they &apos;re not giving us good representation ,  and we can &apos;t afford to have them around .  ever supervise salesmen ? 
i can &apos;t take that job !  i mean ,  i mean ,  i can &apos;t take it right away .  i &apos;m still recuperating ,  i just dropped in to say hello ,  see everybody  -  - 
oh ,  come on ,  roy . 
so what &apos;s your story today ? 
don &apos;t mention it . 
i tripped over a chair . 
roy ,  i don &apos;t want money from you . 
well ,  sure ,  roy .  you want me to drive up  -  -  ?  okay ,  fine ,  come on down .   it won &apos;t be a home - cooked meal ,  you know . 
myra followed you ,  huh ?

lilly ,  jesus ,  what are you doing ? 
joe ,  i thought i was gonna be all right by now ,  i just need a little more  -  - 
i &apos;ll have it tonight .  nine o &apos;clock ?  ten ? 
you aren &apos;t taking me for granted ,  are you ? 
roy ? 
well ,  no ,  roy .  your mother found you . 
big spender . 
the tap .  what you do for a living . 
is that right ? 
i don &apos;t know ,  myra ,  i never had partners .  i never needed them . 
regret what ?  i didn &apos;t say i was coming aboard . 
you mean ,  it would be too tough to give me a turndown here .  easier on home grounds . 
wait a minute !  when did this happen ,  that we &apos;re partners ? 
the last i looked ,  we were just talking things over . 
you watch that mouth . 
i realize this is a shock . 
yes ,  i know ,  i know . 
well ,  i &apos;m back now .  i just wanted you to know .  gotta rush . 
with all due respect ,  detective ,  you can &apos;t go blaming every brutal murder in illinois on michael meyers . 
well ,  when you put it that way . 
where ? 
come on ,  carter .   you know it &apos;s michael . 
carter . 
mind if we sit down ? 
bruce .  .  .  what &apos;s going on ?   the kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival . 
my god .  .  . 
think eddie had something to do with it ? 
no .   wait for the police . 
don &apos;t think so .   but they sure did a real number on your office .  crap everywhere . 
nothing &apos;s changed since yesterday ,  or last week ,  or last month .  .  .  the answer &apos;s still  &quot; no .  &quot; 
you &apos;re twisted . 
wrong .   there are rules in this house and you &apos;re going to follow them whether you like it or not . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  alright ?   it was just a stupid joke . 
you some kind of fugitive or something ? 
where &apos;s molly ?   she &apos;s not in her room .  .  . 
shelve the barf bag .   it &apos;s the key to the main gate . 
you look kind of cold . 
you okay ?   you seem a little off . 
this kid just wants his freedom . 
hey ,  you alright ? 
the serial killer ? 
you aced it ,  didn &apos;t you ? 
condom boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria . 
let the party begin . 
beth ,  who &apos;s that guy that lives across the hall from you ? 
happy fuckin &apos; halloween . 
come on ,  sweetheart  -  -  what is this ?  who &apos;s coming ? 
what now ?  ! 
there &apos;s more people moving eastbound down old reservoir road past the elementary school . 
no one &apos;s home .   checked it out myself . 
your madness is another man &apos;s greatness .   this is the way things have always been .   you &apos;ve just been too blinded by your own reality to see .   but having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways .   you always did come through  -  -  our loyal watch dog .  finding him .  bringing him back to us once he &apos;d finished his work .   although after you had that nasty stroke the last time ,  i had to go after him myself .   and what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell . 
you &apos;ve created a monster . 
what do you know about michael ? 
home ,  sweet home . 
i suppose . 
i wish you &apos;d tell alice that .   and that goddamn mrs .  wheeler . 
you don &apos;t know my mother - in - law ,  boy . 
i guess .   you &apos;re lucky you don &apos;t have any old people around here . 
excuse me . 
me ? 
eight years you guys were together -  -  through thick and thin . 
i &apos;m smarter than looseleaf . 
you -  - you aren &apos;t going to have any friends left ,  if you don &apos;t watch out . 
sir ? 
you don &apos;t know where your mother is ?  does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night ? 
even this -  -  &quot; herb shuttle &quot;  ,  you said ? 
what does he do -  - of an athletic nature ? 
oh hell . 
we blacked our hands and faces .   at midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village .   the name of the village was mhravitch .  remember that name ! 
we caught another kraut alone in a back lane .   your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire .   your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire .   that &apos;s nicer than a knife ,  isn &apos;t it -  - as long as you don &apos;t look at the face afterwards .   the face turns a curious shade of avocado .   i must ask the doctor why that is .   at any rate ,  we stole into the back of the inn ,  and ,  with the permission of the management ,  we poisoned the wine of six krauts who were carousing there . 
tomorrow &apos;s another day .  paul you know what my english literature teacher said about you ? 
she said you were legendary .   i wrote a theme about you ,  and she said ,   &quot; your father is a legendary hero out of the golden age of heroes .  &quot; 
she was on her way home from a meeting of the african violet society ,  and they got her . 
play ? 
a hundred dollars for breakfast ? 
that &apos;s a rifle you have ? 
then speak ,  by god !   can you fight with words ? 
when i &apos;m dead -  -   or fucking . 
you know what i want ?   i want you both to be friends .   i know you both ,  respect you both .  you should be friends . 
harold ! 
you &apos;ll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again .   you used to eat it up . 
we were one hell of a pair -  - and we &apos;ll be one again .   what we need is a honeymoon .   let &apos;s start right now . 
now -  - turn around ,  if you would . 
don &apos;t lecture me on race relations .  i don &apos;t have a molecule of prejudice .   i &apos;ve been in battle with every kind of man there is .  i &apos;ve been in bed with every kind of woman there is -  - from a laplander to a tierra del fuegian .  if i &apos;d ever been to the south pole ,  there &apos;d be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me .   cook ! 
the doctor . 
that &apos;s too bad .   i would rather have him at home -  - to see what i &apos;m going to do . 
you took him to the funeral ,  i hear . 
a dozen ? 
did you like it ,  dear ? 
unless she has nerve . 
the old heroes are going to have to get used to this ,  harold -  - the new heroes who refuse to fight .  they &apos;re trying to save the planet .  there &apos;s no time for battle ,  no point to battle anymore . 
i &apos;m turning off the alarm .   i &apos;m turning off everything . 
she &apos;s right ,  norbert -  - go home .  woodly i haven &apos;t said all i have to say . 
safe and sound ,  i see .   oh -  - you came back . 
you can also describe its cure .  i &apos;m eating its cure . 
wasn &apos;t that sweet of me ? 
i &apos;m going to have to report you to the department of health . 
what an hallucination !   oh ,  dear ,  dear ,  dear ,  dear .   oh dearie me . 
you have a very good mind ,  or i wouldn &apos;t have come back .   that mind is now asking itself ,  cleverly and fairly ,   &quot; is harold ryan really a clown ?  &quot;  and the answer is ,   &quot; yes .  &quot; 
you &apos;re too modest . 
i dunno ,  boy . 
it was a bitch . 
what happened ? 
so long ,  you guys . 
won &apos;t you please join our club ?  please ? 
aha !   hello !   you &apos;re mildred ,  right ? 
is it ?   i have this theory about why men kill each other and break things . 
you sure misunderstood something -  -  and we &apos;d better get it straight . 
oh ,  paul -  - 
he &apos;s a ghost ! 
norbert was just beginning practice .  a real man would have sold her to a catfood company ,  i suppose .   as far as that goes ,  j .  edgar hoover still lives with his mother . 
what &apos;s his name ? 
what ? 
i don &apos;t get it . 
it &apos;s fine ! 
please -  - 
i &apos;m touched . 
a week .   we were waiting for the right time to -  - 
oh no !   wear a coat of cotton -  - wear a coat of wool . 
after this explosion ,  i think ,  he &apos;ll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again . 
he can make the sound of human footsteps -  - which is a terrifying sound . 
everything &apos;s going to be beautiful . 
chinese maniacs and russian maniacs and american maniacs and french maniacs and british maniacs have turned this lovely ,  moist ,  nourishing blue - green ball into a doomsday device .   let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile ,  and that &apos;s the end of mankind . 
kid -  - kid -  - 
we &apos;re going to have jackets ,  aren &apos;t we ? 
what we offer here is nude body to body contact on a bed in a private room .  it &apos;s twenty dollars a half hour ,  thirty dollars an hour .  anything else you desire may be discussed in the privacy of your room .  tips are allowed .  we accept bank americard ,  master charge and american express . 
no .  i don &apos;t think so . 
i heard you the first time .  we had nothing to go on with this kid .  just a runaway .   do you really think he &apos;s in danger ? 
i just want to ask some questions . 
no ,  i don &apos;t . 
just one . 
man ,  how many girls do you need ? 
is this all the display space we can get ? 
joanne ? 
make it nine hundred .  that was my best week . 
you don &apos;t drink ? 
you know what i &apos;m talking about . 
i don &apos;t see why i must justify myself to you .  i don &apos;t care about the things you do .  i don &apos;t care what &apos;s happening in new york or los angeles .  i don &apos;t care about movies or tv .  i don &apos;t care who &apos;s on johnny carson . 
i is for irresistible grace .  god &apos;s grace cannot be resisted or denied .  and p is for the perseverance of the saints .  once you are in grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect .  and that &apos;s the  &apos;tulip .  &apos;
tod &apos;ll meet you at the bookstore at eddy and o &apos;farrell tomorrow noon .  i told him you were a  &apos;specialty &apos; customer . 
rot in hell ,  honey .   he &apos;s busy now . 
what happened ? 
listen ,  niki .  my daughter &apos;s been missing five months .  i &apos;ve gone through a lot to find out what &apos;s happened to her .  i just saw a girl killed .  i will not let tod slip out of my hands .  you have to tell me where he is . 
andy . 
this used to be a real city .  i was here about fifteen years ago .  embezzlement case .  it was always a little religious for my taste ,  but at least it was a city .  with a downtown and all . 
i don &apos;t know . 
yeah .  you ever seen any of those ? 
wait .  slow down .  a film like this ,  16mm ,  cost two three hundred dollars ,  sold outright ,  shown in peep machines ,  maybe theatres ,  maybe not ,  is almost impossible to track .   &apos;nobody &apos; makes it;  &apos;nobody &apos; shows it;  &apos;nobody &apos; sees it .  it &apos;s like it doesn &apos;t even exist . 
it was called  &apos;slave of love &apos; when i bought it .  next time it &apos;s sold ,  it &apos;ll be called something else . 
the police ?  they know less than you do . 
i ain &apos;t cheated you ,  pilgrim .  this is research ,  damn it !  that girl could have told us something . 
oh ,  fuck off .  you should stay where you belong . 
what happened ,  pilgrim ? 
you want to go for coffee after we send the girls off ? 
just do what i say .  don &apos;t ask . 
god ,  i don &apos;t know what it was called .  i never saw it .  i only got twenty -  five bucks for the whole goddamned thing . 
she &apos;s got a man .  a white guy .  tod something or other . 
do you work for the san francisco police department ,  or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency ? 
what is that ?  a kind of chair ?  i never heard of no ratan . 
who told you about this ? 
here .  take your fifty cents back . 
i got a picture here .  i want you to tell me where to find this woman .  i been asking everybody .  nobody knows anything . 
what does that do ? 
i &apos;m off that case .  he fired me . 
to his own daughter ? 
you know granville &apos;s looking for you ,  niki ? 
the guy who bought you that ring . 
i ain &apos;t ever gonna see him again anyway . 
i want you to take a look at this girl here .  she &apos;s been in some porn stuff . 
you are at the university ,  candy ? 
eh ,  poli sci ? 
how long have you been driving ? 
because if you are .  .  . 
this way ,  edith .  harold is out by the garage .  he has a new car and he has been tuning it up .  he &apos;s very mechanical . 
it &apos;s a question of emphasis ,  you might say .  accentuate the positive ,  so to speak . 
do you dance ? 
yes . 
but this is my car . 
not any< / u> car .  i like to keep a variety .  i &apos;m always looking for the new experience ,  like this one .  i liked it . 
here we are ,  harold .  oat straw tea and ginger pie . 
i should like to change into a sunflower most of all .  they are so tall< / u> and simple .  and you ,  harold ,  what flower would you like to be ? 
what ? 
what &apos;s that ? 
oh ,  that was fun .  let &apos;s play something together . 
i like glaucus . 
i &apos;m sure picking up on vices . 
yes .  i haven &apos;t lived .   i &apos;ve died a few times . 
oh . 
maude ,  i must speak to you . 
you should have been a poet . 
yes . 
why are there no photographs in these frames ? 
i was remembering how much this meant to me .  it was after the war .  .  .  i had nothing .  .  .  except my life .  how different i was then  -  and yet how the same . 
oh ,  harold !  what a fuss this is .   so unnecessary . 
mother .  i &apos;m going to get married . 
and why is that ? 
you mean when i &apos;m not working on a .  .  . 
that &apos;s very interesting ,  harold ,  and i think very illuminative .  there seems to be a definite pattern emerging .   your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state ,  your self - destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction .  what do you think ?  and of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with .  recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution .  but tell me ,  what do you do for fun< / u> ?  what activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others ?  what do you find fulfilling ?  what gives you that certain satisfaction ? 
you don &apos;t seem to be listening .  i asked do you have any friends ? 
your studies ? 
why ? 
and so i ask you  -  why the hell did we give up on the germans ?  those damn politicians in washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace .  hell ,  look at history .  the two best wars this country has fought were against the jerries .  now i say ,  get the krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong ,  and let &apos;s get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support . 
yes . 
will they really teach me to shoot ? 
i &apos;d like that .  you could see the blood squirt out . 
of your kill  -  ears ,  nose ,  scalp ,  privates . 
yes . 
well ,  i didn &apos;t . 
oh ,  kirsty; so eager to play ,  so reluctant to admit it . 
frank . 
oh ,  right .  daddy &apos;s died and gone to heaven ,  eh ? 
i want to go back ! 
oh ,  jesus .  i can &apos;t explain .  it &apos;s .  .  .  it &apos;s .  i don &apos;t know how to help !  i have to save him and i don &apos;t know how to help ! 
i have to go back .  or it &apos;ll never stop . 
well .  .  .  g &apos;bye . 
the past ,  the future ,  whatever this object holds . 
harbinger of pestilence ,  seed of destruction  -  - 
here .  you &apos;ll need one of these . 
what a load of crap .  hell ,  a week ago i hadn &apos;t even heard the word parabnormal  -  - 
half transmission .  nonsense  -  -  german ghost stories ! 
i do .   how many escapes ?   this year alone :  five ! 
son .  about rasputin  -  - 
how does he know so much about me ? 
who &apos;s the squirt ? 
hey ,  hey ,  hey .  they &apos;re playing our song . 
c &apos;mon ,  champ .  you look a little woozy ,  there . 
oh ,  jesus !  !  hellboy  -  -   ?  ?  is real  -  - 
sir ,  may i go first ?  ? 
you &apos;d better stay here .  i &apos;ll find a way out .  we &apos;ll come back for you . 
no ,  no ,  no ,  it &apos;s fine :  i do my job ,  i take a break . 
down there .  did you ever loose track of him ? 
nah ,  sounds too  &quot; needy .  &quot; 
anything else you  -  - 
well good n - 
are you sure about this ? 
you better have that looked at . 
just take it slowly . 
it &apos;s my lucky day . 
eh ,  chas ,  slow it down like the man says . 
got her mother &apos;s looks . 
the box .  .  .  you opened it .  we came . 
just in time . 
please .  get back into bed . 
you remember . 
you &apos;re julia ,  right ? 
well can i come in or not ? 
i &apos;m hurting
poor larry .  obedient as ever . 
this is what began it . 
sure .  somewhere safe .   safe .  christ !  they tortured me here .  in this room . 
no ,  damn you  -  - 
i thought half of it was your brother &apos;s ? 
all right . 
what have you done ? 
maybe a brandy . 
who was it ? 
what &apos;s wrong with you ? 
dead . 
not much fun ,  is it ? 
is this your place  ? 
no ,  not much . 
you know ,  you &apos;re very beautiful . 
what did you say ? 
i thought you were going to stay with us for awhile ? 
great . 
upstairs .   treat her gently ,  huh ?  she hates moving . 
 .  .  . maybe we should never have come back . 
i guess . 
she doesn &apos;t even want to leave the house . 
we &apos;re on the cointreau . 
you know i do know the way home . 
why don &apos;t you stay at larry &apos;s house ?  there &apos;s plenty of room . 
meaning what ? 
it &apos;s not what i heard . 
i &apos;ll come back later ,  huh ? 
do i know you ? 
alison &apos;s . 
play it . 
we &apos;ll do it next monday . 
not the point . 
there &apos;s something different about the sound of her voice .  .  .  and what did she mean last night ,  she hasn &apos;t slept with him yet .   yet .   what does  &quot; yet &quot;  mean ,  anyway ?    &quot; i haven &apos;t seen .  .  .  evil dead ii yet .  &quot;  what does that mean ?   it means you &apos;re going to go ,  doesn &apos;t it ? 
i &apos;m sorry ,  rob ,  but i &apos;m struggling here .   i don &apos;t understand any part of this conversation .   you &apos;re asking me what i would think if you told me that you hadn &apos;t seen a film that you &apos;ve seen .   what am i supposed to say ? 
my band . 
it was jan ,  and it was a long time after -  - 
what the fuck is that ? 
like fuck you are . 
sonic death monkey . 
well what about the new echo  -  - 
holy shiite !   what the fuck &apos;s this ? 
who are you going to see ? 
anna moss . 
okay ,  okay  -  -   &quot; leader of the pack .  &quot;  the guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right ?   &quot; dead man &apos;s curve ,  &quot;  jan and dean .  .  . 
 &quot; somebody &apos;s gonna die &quot;  by blitz .   &quot; bella lugosi &apos;s dead ,  &quot;  bauhaus .  it &apos;s got that creepy halloween feeling . 
right .   so .   you must have an enormous record collection . 
your desert island top - five . 
oh ,  i &apos;m sure i can manage something .  .  .   &quot; sin city .  &quot;   &quot; new rose ,  &quot;  by the damned .   &quot; hit it and quit it &quot;  by funkadelic .   &quot; shipbuilding ,  &quot;  elvis costello ,  japanese import ,  no horns ,  or different horns ,  anyway .  .  .  um .  .  .   &quot; mystery train &quot;  by elvis presley .  .  .  and .  .  .   &quot; spaced cowboy &quot;  by sly and the family stone .   a bit controversial ,  i know ,  but .  .  . 
sure ,  but is that it for the list ? 
and the new label ?   and the kinky wizards ? 
fantastic but i &apos;m a little busy right now .   listen .   do you want to come to dinner saturday ?   i &apos;m having some friends over and i need a spare man .  are you a spare man ? 
hey charlie . 
hey .   didn &apos;t you steal that one already ? 
are you all right ? 
or rather ,  bad news and good news ,  because he likes this person playing tonight .   i mean ,  he liked laura too ,  i didn &apos;t mean that .   and he likes you .   it &apos;s just that  -  - 
i always hated this song . 
i will now sell four copies of cats and dogs by the royal trux . 
funnily enough i haven &apos;t been too thrilled about it . 
shit ! 
how can you like art garfunkel and marvin gaye ?   it &apos;s like saying you support the israelis and the palestinians . 
but don &apos;t you remember ? 
i guess it &apos;s not that obvious ,  then . 
i am not living with him .   i &apos;ve just been staying with him for a few days until i work out what i &apos;m doing .  look ,  this has nothing to do with anyone else .   you know that ,  don &apos;t you ?   i left because we weren &apos;t exactly getting along ,  and we weren &apos;t talking about it .   and i suddenly realized that i like my job ,  and i like what my life is could be turning into ,  and that i &apos;m getting to a point where i want to get my shit together and i can &apos;t really see that ever happening with you ,  and yeah ,  yeah ,  i sort of get interested in someone else ,  and that went further than it should have ,  so it seemed like a good time to go .   but i have no idea what will happen with ian in the long run .   probably nothing . 
i suppose so . 
you won &apos;t like it . 
well .   sex ,  i guess .   is sex with him better ? 
i don &apos;t know . 
and anyway ,  i keep trying to tell you ,  that &apos;s not really the point ,  is it ?   the point is we got ourselves into an awful mess ,  rob .  .  .   are you there ?   what are you thinking ? 
are you still in love with me ? 
i don &apos;t want to .   don &apos;t need to .   i love you . 
i don &apos;t really want to talk about it ,  to be honest . 
you know that i can cook my ass off when i feel like it . 
okay ,  okay .   i get the picture . 
i guess i am . 
guess who i just saw ,  right by my store ?   ian .   in starbuck &apos;s .   neat ,  huh ? 
who the fuck &apos;s pig ? 
what do you mean ? 
i &apos;ve only got a couple left .   i &apos;m saving them for later . 
no ,  no .   it &apos;s not .  .  .  are you still on the pill ? 
what about ian ? 
mission accomplished . 
look ,  rob .   if great sex was as important as you think it is ,  and if i was having great sex with him ,  then we wouldn &apos;t be lying here now .  and that is my last word on the subject ,  okay ? 
you haven &apos;t changed so much as a pair of socks in the years i &apos;ve known you .   if we &apos;ve grown apart ,  then i &apos;m the one who &apos;s done the growing ,  and all i &apos;ve done is change jobs . 
less neurotic .   are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life ? 
yeah ,  you &apos;re alright .   but you &apos;re certainly not happy .   so what happens if you get happy ?   and yes i know that &apos;s the title of an elvis costello album ,  i use the reference deliberately to catch your attention .  should we split up because i &apos;m used to you being miserable ?   what happens if you ,  i don &apos;t know ,  start you &apos;re own record label ,  and it &apos;s a success ?  time for a new girlfriend ? 
you did that deliberately .   you knew all along i &apos;d like them .   it was a trick . 
yeah ,  and he said it &apos;s a good way to break out a record .   especially for what he said ,  and i quote ,   &quot; would be a highly anticipated event ,  locally .  &quot;  he helped me put out a press release . 
just local ,  of course . 
barry said its done . 
are you worried about tomorrow night ? 
about what ? 
i &apos;m an idiot .   i should have played the record first .   this place is about to get burned down . 
you &apos;re kidding .   a crematorium ?  jesus . 
good .    &apos;cause i &apos;m enjoying myself . 
awhile back ,  dick and barry and i agreed that what really matters is what you like ,  not what you are like .  .  . 
i &apos;d like it if you could stay the night . 
so you &apos;ll stay ? 
that way . 
how would i know ?   gone .   girlfriend .  leave .   not say where gone .   laura move out . 
what do you think ? 
oh ,  come on !   let me give you ten dollars for this ,  and you can give the rest away for all i care . 
we &apos;re not there yet ,  justin . 
taupin ,  isn &apos;t that the guy moran picked up the other night ? 
someone beat you . 
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . 
jesus christ . 
no . 
no .   so what now ?   we just wait ? 
then you must be at least 70 years old . 
there are differences . 
i haven &apos;t killed _you_ . 
but you &apos;re known so much .  history i &apos;ll only read about . 
what &apos;s wrong ? 
the emptyness .   the years and years of void .   nothingness .   bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness .  who would have guessed ? 
what are you going to tell them ?   that you &apos;re protecting a man who &apos;s killed four people ? 
but we might just give it the  &apos;ole college try .   what with the court back ups ,  it could be days before you got an arraignment .  but then ,  i &apos;m sure the flunk - out neice of the d . a .  knows all about that . 
come on brenna ,  your ass is already in a sling ,  don &apos;t drag me into it . 
afternoon . 
you &apos;re not from these parts . 
in my travels i heard the story of the macleod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this earth . 
as they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes .   to feel it ,  to know it ,  is to be in touch with the will of every living thing . 
my future husband died in battle against the sutherlands . 
eat up dupont .   it will probably be your last . 
yeah . 
no ,  seriously .   we used to shoot pool together in rangoon . 
what &apos;s the point !   you have me ,  finish it ! 
perhaps miss cartwright would like to play . 
i want you to come to me . 
this your present address ? 
what were _you_ looking for ? 
look ,  i don &apos;t know what the hell you &apos;re up to ,  but i think i &apos;ve got a pretty good idea . 
when your father died i saw to it that the grounds were kept up . 
nothing to be sorry about . 
how do you mean ? 
oh ,  it isn &apos;t like that . 
i don &apos;t use my wife for business purposes ,  mr .  burns ! 
all right .   one  -  -  two  -  -  three  -  -  four  -  -  five .  five hundred .  be careful ,  honey . 
what &apos;s the matter ? 
i can &apos;t imagine who did it .  i can &apos;t think of any enemies i have . 
bruce !  !  how &apos;d you get out ? 
this is a pleasure ,  mr .  baldwin ,  and i &apos;m sorry about the mistake . 
where are we going ?  i &apos;m going to buy you two lunch  -  -  didn &apos;t hildy tell you ? 
mighty nice little town ,  albany .  they &apos;ve got the state capitol there ,  you know . 
just what is the lowdown on williams ? 
don &apos;t thank me .  i should thank you .  so long . 
i &apos;ll see she &apos;s there ,  bruce ,  i promise you . 
i &apos;ll find her ,  bruce ,  if i have to put every detective in the city on the job .  tell you what  -  -  go over to the missing persons bureau and describe your mother .  what does she look like ? 
if you &apos;ve any accusations to make ,  hartman ,  make them in the proper manner .  otherwise ,  i &apos;ll have to ask you to get out . 
i can explain that ,  hartman .  when hildy told me she wanted to interview earl williams i thought it might be dangerous and i gave her a gun to defend herself . 
no ?  well  -  -   johnson ,  you &apos;re under arrest .   you ,  too ,  burns . 
call duffy ! 
this is the morning post you &apos;re talking to ! 
that &apos;s absurd on the face of it ,  mr .  burns !  he &apos;s talking like a child . 
hello ,  hildy ! 
you &apos;re repeating yourself !  that &apos;s the speech you made the night you proposed .    &quot;  -  -  any time  -  -  any place  -  -  anywhere !  &quot; 
well ,  why did you promise me you wouldn &apos;t fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works ? 
deny it !  i &apos;m proud of it !  we beat the whole country on that story . 
i haven &apos;t any hard feelings . 
what do you mean by that ? 
well ,  go on and take it .  work for somebody else !  that &apos;s the gratitude i get for  -  - 
why should i ?  i thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering . 
i made a great reporter out of you ,  hildy ,  but you won &apos;t be half as good on any other paper ,  and you know it .  you need me and i need you  -  -  and the paper needs both of us . 
sweeney !  you can &apos;t do that to me !  not today ,  of all days !  jumping jehosophat !  oh ,  no ,  sweeney .  .  .  well ,  i suppose so .  .  .  all right .  if you have to ,  you have to .   how do you like that ?  everything happens to me  -  -  with 365 days in the year  -  -  this has to be the day . 
all right  -  -  thirty - five ,  and not a cent more ! 
you can &apos;t sell me that ,  walter . 
the quicker the better .  well  -  -  i finally got out what i came in to tell you .   so long ,  walter ,  and better luck next time . 
thanks .  .  . 
here &apos;s luck to the bride and bridegroom . 
how can you have any happiness after that ?  all through the years you &apos;ll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours !  i tell you ,  earl williams &apos; face will come between you on the train tonight  -  -  and at the preacher &apos;s tomorrow  -  -  and all the rest of your lives ! 
now you &apos;re talking ! 
get bruce out of jail !  how can you worry about a man who &apos;s resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on ?  hildy ,  this is war !  you can &apos;t desert now ! 
for pete &apos;s sake ,  hildy ,  they &apos;re waiting for the rest of that story ! 
double - crossing swine ! 
bruce ought to be back by now .  walter ,  you &apos;re not trying anything again ,  are you ? 
where &apos;s mrs .  baldwin ? 
who ?   hello ,  butch !  where are you ? 
ring that number ,  will you ? 
no ! 
which ought to be about three hours more ,  i &apos;d say . 
we &apos;ve certainly been in some swell jams . 
suit yourself ,  kid .  this isn &apos;t for me to decide .  of course ,  you could make a later train and still be in albany tomorrow morning . 
the greatest yarn ever written by anybody .  my hat &apos;s off to you ,  hildy ! 
that &apos;s what makes it romantic .  every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is ,  and vice versa .  but us  -  -  you never know where i am and i &apos;m not sure where you are .  that &apos;s romance ! 
well ,  if she looked like you  -  -  say !  my brains and your looks  -  -  that mightn &apos;t be such a bad combination . 
what ! 
but ,  hildy  -  -  i can explain  -  - 
you stay here .  i &apos;ll find out everything . 
walter ! 
and that means earl williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us ! 
cooley ,  i want to talk to you .

miss mollie malloy .  she &apos;s a wonderful person . 
stop screaming ,  mollie or we &apos;re sunk .  i &apos;m trying to think of something before those reporters get back . 
what &apos;s that ? 
you can &apos;t get him on the phone .  he &apos;s out duckshooting now . 
for heaven &apos;s sake ,  why not ? 
this puts me in a peculiar hole . 
never let a rat creep up on you . 
you &apos;re a dark horse ,  bowling googlies at your age .  toss me up another . 
they pulled them up from all the crossroads ,  so when the germans land they &apos;ll lose their way . 
i suppose they &apos;re still learning ,  that &apos;s why they keep moving about . 
the next one is ours .  either it hits us or it goes past us . 
please god .  not on us .  drop it on mrs .  evans .  she &apos;s a cow . 
consider grace ,  the kids .  i love them like my own .  and you . 
you always were ,  clive .  steady the buffs .

to mary mcdonald ,  thelma richardson ,  bobo hinds ,  lily sanderson .  .  .    .  .  . little sarah whats - it ,  now there was a spirit .  and marjorie anderson . 
yeah ,  it &apos;s a tree .  i used to play there all the time .  but ,  you can &apos;t find it without me .  outsider can &apos;t find no deadwood . 
the lions were totally covered in this guy &apos;s blood .  .  .  i think they ate his face off ,  tore open his rib cage ,  pulled his legs off .  .  .  it was a wild scene . 
come on ,  ma .  .  .  this bitch &apos;s got it coming . 
which way ? 
he left ! 
so ,  you live here alone .  .  .  i mean with just your brother ? 
do you believe this fucking girl ? 
you all having a halloween party tonight ? 
no ,  no i think it &apos;s really interesting . 
really ?  huh ,  i thought for sure you &apos;d say lynette fromme .  she &apos;s got that snooty vibe i know you dig . 
yeah ,  i guess .  .  .  hot chicks are always nuts . 
it &apos;s a hitchhiker . 
that reminds me of a film i saw once of a guy who got out of his car at lion country safari to take a picture of a lion cub and got eaten by the lions . 
should we stop ? 
hey ,  he moved . 
how &apos;s about you give me those same directions . 
worse than a fucking rabid baboon . 
goddamn . 
i always loved that mute broad that chuck heston was shacking up with . 
aw ,  come on .  it will be fun . 
hello .  .  .    .  .  . hey denise .  .  .  what ,  what &apos;s wrong ,  did you break down ? 
oh yeah ,  yeah i &apos;ve driven by that place before .  i seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place . 
how long has it been ? 
don &apos;t be such a fucking smart ass . 
holy jesus ,  somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing . 
what &apos;d ya got there ? 
oh ,  really .  .  .    .  .  . well ,  i &apos;m a pretty good dancer if you know what i mean .  .  .  i bet i got a few moves you ain &apos;t never seen . 
i &apos;m with denise ,  can &apos;t we just walk to someplace ,  this is getting fucking stupid . 
i suggest you kids leave now . 
why ?  why are you doing this ? 
where &apos;s bill ? 
please ,  could i please come in and talk to you for a minute ?  maybe you could take a better look at the picture .  .  .  might stir up something . 
get in .  .  .  now ! 
shit ,  don &apos;t these packrat hillbillies throw anything away ? 
tell it to my daughter . 
you know ,  your hyper sensitive spidey senses .  .  .  like spider - man .  .  .    .  .  . you know ,  like in the comics . 
harold !  tell the boy again . 
tell him ,  harold . 
well ,  don &apos;t jump down my throat .  i &apos;m just trying to help . 
oui .  nathan &apos;s silk suit ,  just like you asked . 
let &apos;s go eat ,  i &apos;m starved . 
only three shocks .  a chimp takes fifteen .  this is going to be tres simple ,  no ,  gabrielle ? 
i have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man .  .  .  but i &apos;m talking too much again ,  no ? 
thank you so much .  merci .  it &apos;s very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment . 
so soft .  so smooth .   i &apos;m sorry .  it &apos;s just .  .  . 
what ? 
i have some thoughts .  i think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape . 
my apologies ,  madam . 
we &apos;re going back to nature ,  you and i .  i &apos;m going to retrain you .  i &apos;m going to make you free again if i have to kill you doing it . 
you what ? 
nice night . 
no .  this is the end of the road .  there &apos;s a dead human being here .  for all of his faults ,  he was a human being ,  and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody . 
puff ,  what happened to you is as much my fault as nathan &apos;s .  maybe more so ,  because i knew it was wrong and i went along with it anyway .  i &apos;m taking responsibility for the murder .  i want you to go back to your old life . 
no .  go back to the woods .  this is a sacrifice i need to make .  in my world we have something called penance .  it &apos;s another abstraction ,  but i had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent .  it doesn &apos;t exist for you ,  and it shouldn &apos;t .  see ,  i could never be free again anyway ,  so i might as well be in jail . 
that &apos;s what i &apos;m counting on . 
you still in the market for a real boy ? 
my brother says the guy &apos;s a thirty -  five year old virgin ,  so maybe he won &apos;t know how women usually feel .  plus he &apos;s got bad eyesight ,  almost legally blind ,  which is helpful in this situation .  plus he &apos;s got an extremely small penis ,  of which he is  &quot; mortifyingly ashamed &quot;  ,  so chances are he &apos;ll be so grateful for any non -  judgmental attention ,  that he &apos;ll be yours forever . 
my brother says he likes you ,  too . 
well he wasn &apos;t really a midget .  he was on the cusp of midgethood .  that &apos;s what made it cheap .  had he been an actual midget ,  there would &apos;ve been nothing cheap about it ,  my dear . 
done ! 
um - mmm .  oh nathan ,  this salad is delish .  .  . 
i &apos;m sorry ? 
i was simply attempting to keep the evening light .  you know that i feel similarly to you about nature . 
i think i &apos;ll get johannsen in chemistry on that .   oh !  did you bring the first aid kit ? 
feral ?  don &apos;t touch him !  he might be diseased !  he might .  .  .  my god ,  rabies ! 
actually ,  i just had an amusing thought . 
who from work ? 
i &apos;m the same person i was before you knew ,  damn it !  oh god ! 
was that okay ?  i mean ,  was i able to .  .  .  satisfy you ? 
are you seeing somebody else ,  nathan ?  i just have to know . 
and what did you do tonight ,  honey ? 
how the hell would you know anything about the human heart ? 
did i ?  i tried so hard !  i really concentrated !  oh ,  i &apos;m so happy ! 
thanks to you ,  nate . 
ugnh . 
puff ,  put the gun down . 
you did create me in your image ,  nathan .  before you i was a simple ,  happy ,  complete being ,  in harmony with the world around me .  after you i became duplicitous ,  cynical ,  angry ,  anal ,  totally out of touch with my surroundings .  in a word ,  nathan ,  i became you .  lila has reintroduced me to myself .  and ,  incidentally ,  what i &apos;m about to do ,  kill you ,  is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the earth .  before when i killed ,  it was for food or in self - defense .  now i will kill for revenge .  revenge is an abstract concept ,  nathan .  and i learned abstract thinking from you . 
wait ! 
mother ? 
it always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind .  are you sure you don &apos;t want anything ? 
i &apos;m ready . 
and a fact is a fact . 
yeah ,  i think we do .  we could try to cut each other up .  but that would be bad for everybody .  bad for me ,  bad for you .  and worst of all ,  be bad for eddie . 
bourbon .  j .  t .  s .  brown . 
you &apos;re damned right i &apos;m sure .  everybody &apos;s got talent .  i got talent .  you think you can play big - money straight pool ,  or poker ,  for forty straight hours on nothing but talent ?  you think they call minnesota fats the best in the country just  &apos;cause he &apos;s got talent ?  nah .  minnesota fats &apos;s got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body . 
you bet he knows how .   you think that &apos;s a talent too ,  huh ?  knowin &apos; how to drink whisky ?  you think minnesota fats was born knowin &apos; how to drink ? 
first time in ten years i ever saw minnesota fats hooked ,  really hooked .  but you let him off . 
get the three thousand .  play minnesota fats again . 
seventy - five per cent .

i &apos;m already rich .  but i like action .  that &apos;s one thing i think you &apos;re good for is action .  besides ,  like i say .  .  .  you got talent .

david thought i was having an affair ,  which i wasn &apos;t . 
he still gets air sick ,  huh ?  in all of this i didn &apos;t get the chance to thank you two . 
love was never our problem .

mr .  president ,  a real pleasure .  they don &apos;t let us out much ,  you know . 
see ,  we can &apos;t duplicate their type of power so we &apos;ve never been able to experiment .  but since these guys started showing up ,  all the gizmos inside turned on .  the last twenty four hours have been really exciting ! 
can we negotiate a truce ?  is there room for co - existance ?   can there be peace between us ? 
what do you want us to do ? 
oh ,  he &apos;s in austria .  a slight detour . 
my reputation precedes me . 
marcus !   i did it ! 
what has the old fool got himself into now ? 
do you believe the grail actually exists ? 
are you expected ? 
tapestries ? 
this is a castle .  and we have many tapestries .  but if you &apos;re a scottish lord ,  then i am mickey mouse . 
 &quot; where the cup that holds the blood of jesus christ resides forever .  &quot; 
the arthur legend .  i &apos;ve heard this bedtime story before . 
and my mother &apos;s ears .  but the rest belongs to you . 
it must be one of these .  .  . 
 .  .  . you did it . 
no !  don &apos;t shoot ! 
she ransacked her own room and i fell for it .  how did you know she was a nazi ? 
the floor &apos;s on fire !  see ?  ! 
three devices of such lethal cunning . 
well ,  i &apos;m as human as the next man . 
you left just when you were becoming interesting .

but in the latin alphabet ,   &quot; jehovah &quot;  begins with an  &quot; i &quot;  . 
elsa never really believed in the grail .  she thought she &apos;d found a prize . 
that car belonged to my brother - in -  law . 
well ,  mr .  prime minister ,  my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in pankot .

a gun ?  yes . 
that bullet was for a  . 38 caliber .  do you own a  . 38 ? 
no ,  only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him .  .  . 
hey ,  lowell . 
hi ,  baby . 
here &apos;s how it works .  you ask me questions .  i tell you if you &apos;re wrong . 
yeah ? 
i can take her . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  darling ,  have you seen my coffee mug .  .  .  ? 
what &apos;s going on ? 
no ,  bergman .  .  .  b . e . r . g . m . a . n .  .  .  .  i &apos;m a producer with  &quot; 60 minutes &quot;  .  .  . 
no classes this morning ? 
 .  .  . no .  .  .  this looks like a table of temperatures .  .  .  who &apos;s this from ? 
 &quot; i &apos;m lowell bergman ,  i &apos;m from  &apos;60 minutes .  &apos; &quot;  you know ,  you take the  &quot; 60 minutes &quot;  out of that sentence ,  nobody returns your phone call .  maybe wigand &apos;s right .  maybe i &apos;m hooked .  what am i hooked on ?  the rush ?   &quot; 60 minutes &quot;  ?  what the hell for ?  infotainment .  it &apos;s so fucking useless ,  all of it . 
yes ,  i &apos;m right here .  could you call me back on a hard line ? 
well ,  i &apos;m working with someone ,  now ,  who was the former head of research at brown & williamson ,  a former corporate officer there . 
has he decided to go public ?  because let me tell you ,  we &apos;ve been doing this for three years now ,  and we &apos;ve worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle - blowers ,  so we know .  .  .  big tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him .  so ,  is your man truly committed ? 
it would be better if he called us . 
yeah ,  i &apos;m here . 
well ,  it isn &apos;t  &quot; cigarettes are bad for you &quot;  .  .  . 
so ,  is everything okay ? 
it went great in mississippi ,  mike . 
i don &apos;t know .  how does that get wigand on the air ? 
yeah ,  that &apos;s right . 
give me a break ! 
in the real world ,  when you get to where i am ,  there are other considerations .  .  . 
mike .  .  .  in my .  .  . 
 .  .  . but that &apos;s as far as i go .  .  . 
what do .  .  . 
so ,  you didn &apos;t mention my name ?  you haven &apos;t talked to anybody about me ? 
talk to me outside the zone of your agreement ? 
like where &apos;d you work before brown & williamson ? 
seven dwarfs ? 
the new place ?  new . 
yes . 
no ,  don &apos;t evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or  &quot; 60 minutes &apos; &quot;  with this cheap skepticism ! 
excuse me .  yeah .  .  . 
 &quot; part of the reason i &apos;m here is i felt that their representation clearly ,  at least within .  .  .  &quot; 
 .  .  . i was young .  i was young .  .  .  confused .  .  .  we didn &apos;t handle it the right way .  .  . 
some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview .  .  .  where you &apos;re saying you were on the american judo team in the olympics .  .  .  ? 
you manipulated me into this .  .  .  ! 
you greased the rails ! 
i think i need to call the police .  he won &apos;t respond .  .  . 
you &apos;re saying that brown & williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix ,  not by artificially adding nicotine ,  but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia .  .  . 
i sent the document forward to sandefur .  i was told that we would continue to work on a substitute ,  we weren &apos;t going to remove it as it would impact sales ,  and that that was his decision . 
most certainly . 
poor communication skills . 
jeff &apos;s a premiere golfer .  .  .  what are you ,  a two handicap ? 
okay .   i don &apos;t believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements .  i was paid well for my work .  the health and welfare benefits are good .  the severance package is fair .  i have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which i said i wouldn &apos;t . 
miles ,  how nice of you to see us  -  -  may i introduce howard d .  doyle of doyle oil . 
muh  -  -  well ,  uh  -  -  huh ? 
no ! 
 -  -  understand what you &apos;re asking for here .  the massey pre - nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason ,  both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in ,  and earned during .  no one can profit from the marriage .  the pre - nup protects the wealthier party . 
and without it ,  that party is exposed  -  -  a sitting duck .  no wriggle room . 
i am here representing mr .  dumbarton ,  on a .  .  .  matter of some delicacy . 
well  -  -  i ,  uh ,  that is to say mr .  dumbarton  -  -  would like you to uh ,  neutralize a ,  uh ,  business associate by the name of marylin rexroth doyle massey uh dumbart  -  -  uh ,  massey . 
whoever sent you ,  i &apos;ll pay double . 
you were going to be a cardiac surgeon .  i was going to clerk for the supreme court . 
you &apos;re in check . 
she can &apos;t really love that idiot ,  can she ? 
they won &apos;t get a conviction .  the husband called it in as a suicide .  the forensic guys weren &apos;t thinking murder .  i &apos;m sure some of the evidence was compromised . 
so who &apos;d you hire ? 
you should have tried to get pregnant marylin  -  -  solidify your position . 
i begged you to have a baby ! 
not really .  you &apos;re not my client .  freedom of association .  big issue with the first amendment fans .  want to go to hawaii for the weekend ? 
and you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him ? 
getting married . 
well ,  when this goes south  -  -  promise you &apos;ll have dinner with me ? 
to victory . 
hello ? 
no .  she loved me .  she would never not love her son .  she just didn &apos;t .  .  .  i wasn &apos;t her  &quot; type .  &quot;  she said i was a very ,  colicky baby .  you know ?  difficult .  not a good sleeper ?  didn &apos;t eat well ?  we got off to a bad start ,  and she never seemed to recoup  -  - 
apparently she was very disappointed . 
you do ? 
wasn &apos;t she the judge at my divorce hearing ? 
i &apos;m sorry .  i &apos;m squishing you .  i &apos;ll move to the .  .  . 
hardly .  you have six bedrooms
i have a surprise for you . 
hello ? 
it &apos;s a no go ,  joe . 
hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us . 
are you alright ?  you lost weight . 
do you need a tagamet ? 
please .  i &apos;m not seeing anyone until this is over .  one husband at a time . 
anyway ,  even rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence .  if i didn &apos;t know better ,  i &apos;d swear massey had some personal investment in my ruination . 
well ,  if he continues to maintain this position  -  -  we &apos;re in court . 
soon ,  you &apos;ll have your own rage ! 
my client has ruled that out . 
my client feels sufficiently dispassionate . 
don &apos;t threaten me ,  miles .  i did nothing illegal . 
miles massey .  please sit ,  relax ,  and consider this office your office ,  your haven ,  your war room  -  -  for the duration of the campaign . 
i think that went as well as could be expected . 
and she has .  .  .  ? 
wrigley ! 
sometimes i have serious doubts about you . 
what the hell is wrong with you ? 
 .  .  . and i hear she &apos;s richer than croesus . 
she could buy and sell you ten times over . 
i tried to reach ruth ,  but we couldn &apos;t get her . 
it &apos;s not so bad these days .  kids like joint custody .  two sets of toys . 
what &apos;s the matter ?  anything wrong ? 
yes .  i know .  still in the dumps ,  huh ? 
please understand me .  when i say she didn &apos;t tell me anything about it ,  i mean not until a little while ago .  she thinks you &apos;re entitled to anything you can get . 
don &apos;t know .  i &apos;d have to see on what you base your claim .  i presume you feel you &apos;re justified in
why not ?  i &apos;m not charging you for the time i wasted . 
listen ,  did anybody ever make a sucker out of you ?  this is a matter of principle .  something you probably wouldn &apos;t understand .   when somebody takes me for a buggy ride i don &apos;t like the idea of having to pay for the privilege . 
because marrying that fool king westley is
smart ,  aren &apos;t you !  so subtle . 
you only met him once  .

dave ,  can i just ask you this directly ?   did you ever work for the cia ? 
what about ruby ? 
shit !   forgot to glue this fuckin &apos; rug today .   you know ,  at one time i even had a full head of hair like everyone else .   and then i lost that .  that fuckin &apos; clay shaw .   i hate the bastard .   all i got left is in his rotten ,  bloody hands .   he tipped the newspapers  -  i know it .   that &apos;s how the agency works .   they use people ,  chew them up ,  spit  &apos;em out .   now it &apos;s my turn . 
no . 
he asked me why i thought i was in danger and i said : 
i realize you &apos;re under a great deal of stress  .  .  it &apos;s clouded your judgement . 
i &apos;m not sure i understand . 
i would imagine a uniformed waiter helps . 
it says that this company has heavily fascist ties to the french secret army organization that tried to assassinate de gaulle in 1960 . 
and if i was ,  mr .  garrison .  .  .  do you think i would be here today .  .  .  talking to somebody like you ? 
one hour ,  y &apos;hear ?   some saturday night date you are .   mama warned me this would happen if i married such a serious man . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  but it &apos;s important .   clay shaw is important .   i &apos;m sorry . 
hi . 
did they live ? 
just a crank making phone calls .  happens a dozen times a day at the office . 
honey ,  come on .   the government wants you to be scared .   they want everybody to be scared to speak out .   they count on it .   but there &apos;s nothing to be scared of . 
i &apos;ll take them up to my mother &apos;s if it &apos;ll make you feel better .   spend a week .   i &apos;ll change the locks ,  the phone lines ,  i &apos;ll even get a bodyguard ,  all right ?   elizabeth ,  get a hold of yourself . 
damn it ,  if i say i &apos;ll spend more time with him ,  i &apos;ll spend more time with him .   i can &apos;t fight you and the world too ,  liz . 
they killed him ,  honey . 
willie ,  are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal ?   under the supervision of a doctor ? 
i &apos;d say he was probably getting intelligence training . 
bill ,  lou ,  we &apos;re standing in the heart of the united states government &apos;s intelligence community in new orleans .   that &apos;s the fbi there ,  the cia ,  secret service ,  oni .   doesn &apos;t this seem to you a rather strange place for a communist to spend his spare time ? 
who do you think changed the parade route ? 
you know who the mayor was ? 
are they ?   why would they ? 
jim garrison ? 
how much more ? 
yeah ,  he was there ,  too .  .  .  sometimes he &apos;d be meeting with banister with the door shut .   other times he &apos;d be shooting the bull with ferrie .   but he was there all right . 
what &apos;s the problem ?   what &apos;s the problem ?   do i need to spell it out for you ,  mr .  garrison ?   i better go . 
no ,  she could get hurt .   if you believe what &apos;s happening to these other people . 
they &apos;ve been enlarged and show a lot of detail .  .  . 
you were lucky .   i spent three years in the pacific .   i &apos;ve never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail - bonding companies .  why is that ? 
i know about that shot .   a terrible tragedy .   how much do you have for carrying on your investigation ? 
i need some information from you then .   how old are you ? 
but if i am eliminated there won &apos;t be any way of knowing .   consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country ,  and i know i won &apos;t live to see you another time .   my life is in danger here .  do i sound screwy ? 
but then you told her you were home . 
you see ,  it works like this .  you get your ass in trouble ,  i get your ass out .  that &apos;s my job .  and i don &apos;t mind tellin ya ,  nigga ,  it &apos;s steady work . 
what &apos;d ya mean ? 
man ,  i ain &apos;t ready to be goin &apos; out nowhere  -  - 
i ain &apos;t doin &apos; you no way .  i just ain &apos;t climbin &apos; in that trunk .  i got a problem with small places . 
what &apos;s she want ? 
she knows it &apos;s my case ? 
the envelope contains currency .  .  .  all the same denomination ,  one - hundred -  dollar bills .  now ,  i &apos;m counting it . 
hi ,  i &apos;m detective mark dargus .  l . a . p . d .  can i ask what you have in that bag ? 
would i mind ?  do i have a choice ? 
my pocketbook . 
he wouldn &apos;t say .  you gonna follow her ? 
you know who put the dope in your bag ? 
they wanted you to tell them what you know . 
that &apos;s it .  he &apos;s cash poor .  he kept on me till i finally said okay .  i &apos;ll bring whatever fits in a nine - by -  twelve envelope .  i got paid five hundred dollars ,  and his friend ,  mr .  walker ,  in mexico gave me the envelope . 
but if all i can give  &apos;em is ordell &apos;s name  -  -  i don &apos;t really know shit about what he does or how he does it  -  -  that don &apos;t give me much to bargain with . 
you never got into the whole cd revolution ? 
he had his doubts at first .  but he &apos;s always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can . 
it &apos;s very possible ordell &apos;s killed somebody . 
how do you feel about getting old ? 
what &apos;re you ,  a bag lady ? 
you think he &apos;s got a thing for you ? 
i have to stand behind all my active bonds ,  but i &apos;m not writing any new ones . 
what do you do when he comes home ? 
you do that ? 
then you &apos;re out and you get nothing . 
you &apos;re gonna have surveillance all over you . 
in a dress . 
he &apos;s liable to shoot you . 
ray wants him . 
tell him i want to give him his money . 
i &apos;d feel a whole lot better if you took some more money . 
if i don &apos;t cooperate ? 
oh ,  so now you know him ? 
this afternoon before i came here .  he was with ordell at an apartment in hermosa beach .  i don &apos;t know if he lives there ,  but i can find out . 
i imagine shit needs to be done . 
white girl named melanie ralston .  another girlfriend of ordell &apos;s . 
i smiled and walked away .  she also told me ordell killed beaumont . 
uh - huh . 
you said that the last time . 
we could ,  if i &apos;m not in jail . 
ever been tempted ? 
that would be one point of view . 
if it &apos;ll make you happy . 
we were ,  and we lost him .  he walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out .  the bar was on ninth ,  less than a mile -  and - a - half from where louis was found dead .  it looks like louis &apos;s friend shot him twice at point blank range . 
what the hell you doin &apos; ? 
yeah . 
you a fine lookin &apos; woman ,  jackie .  i bet you do a damn sight better than okay .  you think anybody followed you ? 
didja tell  &apos;em anything else ? 
you told them that ? 
what the fuck &apos;s that got to do with it ? 
 .  .  . i make two deliveries .  the first one with ten thousand ,  like a dry run .  they watch it .  see how it works .  then we do a second delivery ,  when i bring in the half mill . 
i don &apos;t know .  one of your friends . 
well ,  it &apos;s my plan .  we &apos;re in this together . 
nicolet and dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills . 
who &apos;s paging you ? 
that works on my nerves ,  you bein &apos; so buddy - buddy with him . 
and a hundred thousand if i go to jail . 
want a hit ? 
is it ready to go ? 
no ,  it &apos;s what body builders drink to beef up . 
which one ? 
i thought you were sixteen . 
where were you ? 
were you a disco guy ? 
i lived there for about nine months . 
i never got to know him ,  really .  i couldn &apos;t speak japanese ,  and his english was terrible .  but i couldn &apos;t say anything ,  because his english was better than my japanese . 
i live here .  he drops in and out .  he tell you about that half - million dollars he &apos;s got in mexico ? 
jesus christ ,  get a grip ,  louis . 
i mean it .  don &apos;t say one fuckin &apos; word . 
i got me five m - 60 machine guns .  these came straight from the gulf war .  i sold me three of them so far ,  twenty grand a piece .

shit !  you know it &apos;s not half the case if i go it alone .  we &apos;re all suffering the same symptoms ,  frank .  the army is to blame .  they &apos;ve done something to us .  how can you not want to know ? 
the army .  the army .  what is it with you guys ?  we &apos;re not talking about a trip to the library here .  this is the united states government for god &apos;s sake .  this is red tape coming out of your ass .  you know what i mean ? 
doctor .   ph . d .

i &apos;ve got a problem ,  prof .  more augus -  tine than kierkegaard ,  if you know what i mean .   i need to know about  .  .  .  demons . 
christ ,  i know how it sounds . 
demons ?  i don &apos;t know what to tell you .  it sounds like a spiritual mat -  ter to me .  the problem ,  jacob ,  is that you have no context for it .  you &apos;re a renegade existentialist suf -  fering demons a hundred years after freud .  how the hell am i supposed to make it fit ? 
i &apos;m not dead .  i am not dead . 
the room !

he &apos;s coming right over . 
look at me .  i &apos;m ice cold . 
i &apos;m not here .  you haven &apos;t seen me . 
it &apos;s amazing ,  you know ,  that a drug could change things like that ,  destroy a life and then give it back .  it &apos;s hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next . 
this is one of my dreams ,  jake .  ever since i was a little girl .  i never thought it would happen . 
tell me ,  damn you ! 
you look terrible .  what happened ?   jake  .  .  .  is it the antidote ?

it &apos;s beautiful .  i &apos;ve always liked gibson better than fender . 
yeah . 
juno ?  wow ,  i didn &apos;t expect to see you here .

i know what junk is .

oh god ,  you &apos;re one of those guys .  .  . 
please don &apos;t get a divorce !  god ,  mark ,  just do me a solid and stay with your wife . 
you should try adderall . 
um ,  i think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it &apos;s not ,  you know ,  set in stone . 
right .  well ,  juno ,  your parents must be wondering where you are .  you might want to head home . 
well hi vanessa !  what brings you to the mall today ? 
oh my god  -  -  it moved !  i felt it ! 
mark ?  why is juno crying ? 
you should have seen this octopus furnace .  i had to get out my hazmat suit just to get up in there .  .  . 
who is the kid ? 
did you say you were thinking about adoption ? 
excuse me ? 
dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level .  where is everyone ? 
maybe it &apos;s just a food baby .  did you have a big lunch ? 
oh my god !  oh shit !  phuket thailand ! 
well ,  are you going to go to havenbrooke or women now for the abortion ?  you need a note from your parents for havenbrooke . 
when did you decide you were going to do bleeker ? 
no way !  she &apos;s pretty . 
i want a huge cookie .  and like ,  a lamb kebob .  simultaneously . 
did you hear bleek is going to prom with katrina de voort ? 
he asked her .  i heard they were going to benihana ,  then the prom ,  then to vijay &apos;s parents &apos; cabin . 
i wouldn &apos;t be so sure about that .  he did it with you .  he &apos;s a man now . 
what do you make with that ? 
what do you think ?  custard or cheesecake ? 
i called gerta rauss .  she says she can represent both of us .  they call it  &quot; collaborative divorce .  &quot;  it &apos;s apparently all the rage right now .  and it &apos;s easy because we don &apos;t have children . 
we &apos;re actually ,  finally doing this ? 
no . 
you lose ! 
early don &apos;t think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor . 
you know i can fix that haircut for you ,  if you want ? 
don &apos;t be long now ,  dinner &apos;s  &apos;bout ready . 
what if they &apos;re dangerous ? 
how many times you gonna tell me that ? 
can you believe thirty bucks for this room .  .  .  for what ?  a lumpy mattress ,  that crummy tv and a crapper . 
nobody wants to hurt you peaches ! 
where you from walter ? 
brian . 
this the book your writing ? 
this guy killed a mess of people . 
yeah ? 
i thought you wanted to be a writer . 
then you can write anywhere .  let &apos;s get out of here ,  while we still can . 
so how &apos;s it going ? 
because i was there .  and for a moment that night i understood how she came to pull the trigger . 
oh ,  yeah .  .  .  he had a real thick accent right outta  &quot; deliverance .  &quot;    &quot; still ?  who said anything about a still ?  get ya ass up in them woods !  &quot; 
all set ? 
who said he &apos;s my good buddy ? 
there &apos;s more .  .  .

i &apos;m sorry ,  but i just can &apos;t see you veggin &apos; out in la - la land . 
 .  .  . janitor &apos;s job . 
could be . 
hell if i know ,  crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to texas . 
with how many people ? 
well it took me longer than i thought it would take .  it took like 15 minutes to talk her into it .  but once it was on ,  we fucked for a good half an hour .  i had to keep taking it out and putting it back in .  it hurts the first time . 
i can tell that she had just entered puberty . 
did she suck your dick ? 
that girl you boned last year .  remember ? 
darcy .  benny &apos;s little sister . 
at that moment ,  at that block party ,  she represented everything holy about a virgin . 
so .  these people live on the same streets .  it &apos;s just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up .  the regular bums aren &apos;t poor enough for you ,  you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks . 
right . 
man ,  telly ,  your little brother is getting big . 
how much you gonna take ? 
hurry up man .  let &apos;s be out .  i wanna go swimmin &apos; .

yeah .  come on . 
no .  no ,  i &apos;m serious .  i &apos;m not joking .  i just like you .  that &apos;s all . 
because i like you .  i think you &apos;re beautiful .  i think if we fucked you would love it .  you wouldn &apos;t even believe it . 
you know it won &apos;t hurt .  i &apos;ll be gentle .  i promise . 
sorry . 
hello . 
telly says was up .

you didn &apos;t ? 
shh .  come on ,  it &apos;s gonna be ok . 
yep .  that &apos;s the best way .  it &apos;s that boom boom boom . 
yep . 
first times are always wacked .  just be glad you didn &apos;t lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car . 
yeah .  and it takes them either too long or too short to come .  have you ever had someone that took forever
shit .  all right .  but don &apos;t fuck with anything ok ? 
i &apos;ve talked to a few people who say you and her were .  .  .  friendly ? 
by yourself ? 
that &apos;s crazy !   why would i draw attention to myself like that ? 
meaning ,  it looks like his victims are chosen at random . 
you sure you weren &apos;t over on pine road ? 
you set yourself up tonight when you attacked kathy ,  you crazy fuck ! 
it &apos;ll take hours .   you can &apos;t make me do this . 
how is she ? 
sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing  -  -  but who called him today ? 
why her ? 
i &apos;m just trying to play the game . 
hello . 
you &apos;re next move should have been e2 -  e3 . 
emotional ?   i expected more from you . 
by that time the game will be over . 
please .  .  .  wait . 
yes ,  i do .   i found your file .   i know what happened . 
naw ,  it &apos;s all fixed .   i also loaded up a program that &apos;ll analyze your games three hundred percent faster . 
there &apos;s three .   the first is 1983 .  lionel baines .   the boston .  .  . 
i admit i handled it badly .   sanderson wasn &apos;t going to talk to me .  .  .  but you &apos;re young ,  attractive -  - 
so ,  are you having a good time on the island ? 
there &apos;s no blood .   where &apos;s the fuckin &apos; blood ? 
you didn &apos;t pick up any vibes from the guy ? 
yes .   why disguise your voice if no one knows it ? 
his home would be .  .  .  mount olympus . 
it can &apos;t be a coincidence .   the woman that owns it has a son .   she says he &apos;s been on vacation in montana for the last ten days .   we &apos;re trying to locate him .   there &apos;s also a cleaning service that comes in once a week .   we &apos;re checking that out too . 
another one ?   what word did he leave ? 
as large as castles .   you are still light as air ,  one hundred men can &apos;t move me . 
it &apos;s a commercial area .   no one lives there . 
as large as castles ,  you are still light as the air ,  one hundred men can &apos;t move me .   it &apos;s posed as a question .  what am i ? 
answer the question . 
don &apos;t you understand what i &apos;m telling you ?   that &apos;s why he wants me out of the way . 
feel like practicing ? 
is this your first time here ? 
are you one of the players ? 
that &apos;s a very personal question . 
but you &apos;re the key .   the one he wants to play the game with . 
i think it &apos;s interesting . 
take your average cop .   they deal with death everyday .   if they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement . 
relax . 
can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it ? 
alright .   what about me ? 
i &apos;m not playing a game now . 
you &apos;re wife died .   you can &apos;t feel responsible for that . 
you &apos;re going to be late for your match . 
me too . 
i love you ,  lyssa ,  i love you  .  .  . 
colwyn  .  .  . 
we were married .  then she was taken by the slayers .  you must help me . 
there is no other way . 
but it opens onto the sheer wall of the needle .  there &apos;s no way down . 
i am too old to climb down a rope . 
you choose these ? 
i can &apos;t reach her . 
she can &apos;t see out .  she can &apos;t tell us where the fortress is . 
the first time ,  when they attacked long ago ,  was the beast here ? 
i will melt that gold and pour it down your throat ,  old man ! 
i just remembered i have urgent business in this direction . 
forgive me .  it &apos;s childish to cry . 
you &apos;ve eaten nothing . 
we could reach it on fire - mares . 
bread is for peasants ,  and wine makes me sneeze .  got any gumdrops ? 
sugarballs ? 
what are you doing with my dear ?  stop !  thieves ! 
and do you think i live on air ? 
i am being exploited !  where are you going ? 
look at its beauty .  look at its grace . 
he is the king . 
lord rowan is one of lyssa &apos;s godfathers .  he will defend her in the ceremony .  i wish that lord modred were here .  he is a godfather of her own blood . 
you were attacked in the forest ? 
you know the voice . 
we &apos;ll seek an emerald seer .  they have great powers of vision . 
we can save half a day by crossing the stone lake . 
you had a son . 
you see ? 
there is a girl there .  her name is lyssa . 
yeah !  i was sure !  come on ,  tell me !  i know him ? 
 .  .  . you moved too ,  didn &apos;t you ? 
yeah .  .  .  well .  .  .  i don &apos;t know .  .  i don &apos;t know any . 
here ,  this is the light scoop for night shooting .  there ,  you fix client &apos;s distance .  .  .  how much to the bench down there in the park ? 
130 .  .  .  140 .  .  . 
who &apos;ll i aim at ? 
what &apos;s up ?  i don &apos;t feel you &apos;re concentrated . 
five minutes .  keep in front of the window . 
you see ,  five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me .  .  .  but i prefer this ! 
well .  .  .  then may you rent me your gear for the day ? 
 .  .  . shit !  !   we &apos;d found him .  we waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window . 
it &apos;s cool departing this way .  .  .  warm .  .  .  music .  .  . 
you &apos;re darkening the picture ,  aren &apos;t you ? 
risky business ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
mathilda .  .  .  there &apos;s equally a lot of other things ! 
i &apos;m here ,  i &apos;ll never leave you again ,  mathilda ,  never .  i swear . 
 .  .  . no .  .  . 
you say it just to calm me ! 
 .  .  . yes ? 
i &apos;m sick with practicing ,  that &apos;s it .  .  . 
rinaldi .  .  .  rinaldi .  .  .   what region do you come from ? 
it &apos;s a little out of the world coming to visit me this way ,  on mid afternoon .   it really isn &apos;t the usual procedure .  .  . 
have you ever been in messina ,  son ? 
salute . 
what is it ? 
this smells good . 
it &apos;s impossible . 
i &apos;ve all ready gone six hundred miles .  .  .  i can &apos;t do it again . 
how long does this .  .  .  mania last ? 
a wife ?  .  .  .  did someone piss drunk run into your wife ?   crushed her like a bug .   snapped her bones ? 
what are the odds ?   do i have a fifty - fifty chance of surviving the operation ? 
i mean why the sudden voluntary visit   -  -  usually it takes gun -  point to get you in here .  .  . 
yes  -  -  you are . 
i &apos;ve seen it before . 
you should start slow and easy  -  -  fifteen minutes a day . 
it &apos;s a special day isn &apos;t it ? 
there &apos;s no reason . 
i thought we both wanted the same things . 
 .  .  .  people that were made to be parents ,  and people who were not made to be parents .  .  .  my parents ,  were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway .   i don &apos;t want us to be that way ellen . 
what did they ask ? 
shit !   he jumped ! 
perhaps there &apos;s another route ? 
you going on a trip mr .  parker ? 
where ? 
when are you leaving ? 
i &apos;m walking there kris . 
you &apos;re amazing .  .  .  what are you doing mr .  parker ? 
i &apos;m really lost .   what does this have to do with walking ? 
ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast .  .  .  everyday .  now that &apos;s about a quarter mile each way .  .  .  17 years .  .  .  that comes to about three thousand miles .  .  .   and you know what kris ? 
why in god &apos;s name did you fly all the way here then ? 
there are a lot of people worried about you . 
you &apos;re going to have a lot of work to do when i get back . 
i don &apos;t have kids . 
what do you want ? 
sparkling apple cider ? 
that is ,  if you &apos;ll come to my room for an hour ,  i will give you five hundred dollars . 
mind if i use the bathroom ? 
do you want to fuck now ? 
what &apos;s the story ?  are you too drunk to come ? 
i think about four weeks ,  and i &apos;ve got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day . 
don &apos;t run away . 
i &apos;m from the east .  i went to college ,  did an arts course .  i now live in vegas .  i think of it as home .  i came here deliberately to carve out a life .  i was in la before ,  but i &apos;ll come back to that later .   the tough times are behind me now .  i can deal with the bad things that happen .  there will always be dark characters .  but my life is good .  it is as i would want it to be .  so ,  why are you a drunk ? 
first .  it &apos;s our first .  i &apos;m just concerned .  so .  .  .  why are you killing yourself ? 
let &apos;s face it ,  what the fuck are you doing in las vegas ? 
don &apos;t you think you &apos;ll get a little bored living with a drunk ? 
want a drink ?  great nap .  wanna go out tonight ? 
where was that house ?  the one in la ,  i mean . 
how &apos;d this happen ? 
yes ?  what ? 
well ,  then .  you &apos;ll need excellent recommendations from your professors ,  a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one - seventy - five on your lsats . 
brooke ,  i believe you .  but a jury is gonna want an alibi . 
what &apos;re you so happy about ?  you &apos;re on trial for murder . 
is he always such an ass ? 
but is he an ass that &apos;s gonna win my case ? 
i &apos;m a delta gamma and i &apos;m a huge fan of yours ! 
that &apos;s just it  -  -  it would ruin me ! 
did you hear a shot fired ? 
but you didn &apos;t hear the shot ,  because you were in the shower . 
chutney ,  why is it that tracy marcinko &apos;s curls were ruined when she got hosed down ? 
all i know is  -  -  it &apos;s not brooke . 
so everything you just said  -  - 
so ,  this is the only interaction you two have ever had ? 
i don &apos;t know !  everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more  -  -   serious ! 
once warner sees me as a serious law student ,  he &apos;ll want me back .  it &apos;s a completely brilliant plan ! 
speaking of which ,  can you please put on some party clothes ?  you look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a k -  mart . 
donovan ,  royalton and levinson . 
in that case ,  maybe heyworth got fellated by a brunette and brooke caught him . 
no  -  -  it &apos;s just  -  -  not me . 
thank you ,  serena ,  but i don &apos;t think it &apos;ll do any good . 
you guys  -  -  i can &apos;t .  we &apos;re in the middle of a trial . 
neither . 
yes ?  ms .  woods ? 
amazing how ? 
c &apos;mon .  let me take you home . 
east coast people are different . 
you look  -  -  nice . 
but i guess it wasn &apos;t enough for brooke . 
is it a kappa ? 
there he is ! 
why so few ? 
you go to lady now ? 
god protect me . 
protection ? 
when the time &apos;s come ,  you won &apos;t need to jump ,  i &apos;ll throw you out myself ! 
no more .  .  .  please .  .  . 
sweet princess ,  you begin to sound most reasonable . 
what was that ?   did you hear that ? 
it &apos;s odd .  .  .  when i first found myself .  .  .  changing .  .  .  i was sick with loathing and disgust .   i thought i was so ugly i wanted to die .  .  . 
you come stealee tleasoo ? 
course not .   i no flum here .   i come flum cathay . 
oh ,  but you will be ,  jack .  .  .  think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a - dancing ? 
no !   tis not the time !   i want no part of your frolic . 
why has this happened to the world ?  why is it winter now ,  and dark ? 
if ye want more tricks ,  i &apos;m your man ,  but for big questions ye must go elsewhere . 
course we care .   what good &apos;s the world locked in a season of death .  frozen up ,  no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer &apos;s night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast .  .  .  think that &apos;s an enjoyable prospect ? 
true .  .  .  but it won &apos;t come easy or free .   if ye want to ask ,  ask jenny greenteeth . 
someone worthy of respect ,  lad .   she be a water spirit ,  lives in a bog down at sea - side .   hideous creature to look at ,  even by my doubtful standards; devours little children ,  she does ,  when she can catch them . 
what do i do ? 
did you hear ?   twas the killing of the unicorn caused it . 
there it be ,  lad .   the lindfarne mound .   kings long forgotten lie there ,  lost in their final sleep . 
so i &apos;m to be a dragon - slayer ,  is that it ? 
by the grace of god . 
shhhh ! 
i &apos;m sure .   it spoke to me . 
worse than the battlefield . 
and this ?   some of their handiwork ? 
why not admit it ,  honeythorn gump .  we &apos;ve lost our way entirely . 
never felt so cold in all me born days .  .  . 
then it &apos;s godspeed ,  screwball . 
jack !   the courtyard &apos;s been taken .  .  .  the baron &apos;s forces are besieged in the south tower .   no sign of .  .  .  jack ?   do you hear what i &apos;m saying ?  we &apos;ve won ,  lad . 
the baron hides in the dark in a passage under the castle .  .  .  quick ,  give me the dwarf &apos;s key .  .  .  the one which opens any lock .  .  . 
sunlight . 
will you explain what &apos;s going on ? 
not in the mood ,  i &apos;m afraid . 
you see !   you see ! 
we seek to undo the curse . 
well done ,  lad . 
someone like floki .  .  .  or squarefoot .  .  .  or  -  - 
but you did .  .  .  you did ! 
a promise is a sacred oath . 
a gentleman would offer water . 
oh ,  dear . 
damned hunters .   it was a trap ,  and you were the bait ! 
how bad was the unicorn &apos;s wound ? 
he did run ? 
there are many would pay a king &apos;s ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood . 
not even the birds sing sweet as you . 
if wishes were horses even beggars would ride . 
sigurd &apos;s sword .  .  . 
here be the death weapon; the unicorn &apos;s blood dry upon it . 
i don &apos;t believe you . 
how so ? 
please .  .  . 
i &apos;m in your debt ,  screwball . 
what care the bones when the soul is free ? 
your fond wishes give me strength ,  dear friends .

you have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid  -  -  engine oil ,  bat &apos;s blood ,  moose piss .  you just have to release the evil within you . 
we had the greatest afternoon of my life until adrian made me tell her she had a heart - shaped ass . 
last time you said that the renaissance happened . 
now everybody sit down . 
you &apos;re a good devil ,  dad .

jessica .  .  .  listen to me .  .  .  listen to me .  .  .   the lifeclocks made me kill francis .  they make people die or be killed every day .  if i didn &apos;t try and destroy that .  .  .  i couldn &apos;t live here or anywhere .  do you understand ? 
are you sure ? 
you &apos;re both full of secrets like macavity .   did you steal this ? 
we don &apos;t get many sandmen .  i think we &apos;ve only had one other since i &apos;ve been here . 
how long have you been living here ? 
what kind of place is this ? 
how did you get here ? 
we &apos;re leaving . 
that &apos;s better than gold when it &apos;s cold . 
you &apos;re not contagious are you ? 
good .  .  .  you up for a drive ? 
you &apos;re a musician ? 
i like to remember things my own way . 
we &apos;ll see that the patrol of the house is doubled .

what &apos;s the matter ? 
who is this man ? 
that &apos;s it .

what are we going to do ? 
i say ,  will you have a cigarette ? 
look ,  honey .  we run the pipes through here ,  and we connect with the main water line here . 
well ,  in that event ,  it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her . 
leave shangri - la !  that &apos;s not likely .  you couldn &apos;t drive her out . 
what do you want ? 
you know ,  it &apos;s very ,  very strange ,  but when you saw me in the corridor ,  i was actually on my way to you .  i bring the most amazing news .   the high lama wishes to see you ,  mr .  conway . 
you &apos;re lying ,  aren &apos;t you ? 
no ,  i can &apos;t !  i can &apos;t !  you &apos;ve got to let me rest !  you &apos;ve got to let me rest ! 
you &apos;re the man chang told me about !  you &apos;re the first  -  who  -  two hundred years ago  you &apos;re still alive ,  father perrault ! 
that conway seemed to belong here .  in fact ,  it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here . 
bob !  i think i hear motors ! 
hurray ! 
hello ,  freshie .  did you make that report out yet ? 
did you say we saved ninety white people ? 
he &apos;s dead . 
of course you would .  if ever we get out of this place ,  the thing for you to do is to take that job with helen &apos;s father . 
george ,  what do you think you &apos;re doing ? 
let me up !  let me up ! 
something grand and beautiful ,  george .  something i &apos;ve been searching for all my life .  the answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime .  i &apos;ve found it ,  george ,  and i can &apos;t leave it .  you mustn &apos;t either . 
i think you &apos;ve been hypnotized by a lot of loose - brained fanatics .  why ,  i wouldn &apos;t believe it if i heard it in an english monastery .  why should i swallow it here in tibet ?   how do you know the things they told you are true ?  did they show you any proof ? 
lucky thing for me you snapped out of it ,  too .  you saved my life .  i never could have made it alone . 
no .  that &apos;s not possible !  if we had landed ,  we all would have been awakened . 
was this your idea ? 
you suggested my being brought here ,  didn &apos;t you ?  what gave you the idea i &apos;d fit in ? 
beautiful !  i &apos;m waiting for the bump . 
you know ,  if you keep on asking that ,  we &apos;re not going to get anywhere .  and don &apos;t ask me why . 
would you like to wring my little neck ? 
you &apos;ll wait till you rot ! 
 .  .  .  think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which i assure you i have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct -  - 
well .  .  .  you know ,  when you say  &quot; normal ,  &quot;  what ,  exactly .  .  . 
everybody ,  listen up :  we &apos;ve had a tremendous amount of movement lately .  be aware .   be safe .   have a good day .   oh ,  uh .  .  .  cowan ? 
so .  .  .  wait .   you just asked .  .  .  but he goes so fast ,  he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it . 
underground gas vein .   next time ,  be more careful when you shoot off your guns . 
hey ,  i was workin &apos; her .   i was workin &apos; my thing . 
a signazoid &apos;s eleven thousand pounds .  i think we &apos;d know if held left . 
something &apos;s wrong here . 
looks like a train ticket . 
you think that &apos;s what &apos;s - happening ? 
ernie goose ?   cynthia ? 
 &quot; perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs .  .  .  &quot; 
what are you doing ? 
we saw it in the office .   it went from this big .  .  .     to big .  .  .    in a day . 
who &apos;s she gonna tell ,  anyway ?  she only hangs out with dead people . 
sure . 
i don &apos;t think so .    i mean ,  him ,  he could be a scientist ,  maybe .   but you .  .  .   exterminator ,  i &apos;d understand .   but entopolgist ?   no way . 
it &apos;s the most amazing insect nest i &apos;ve ever seen .   and i &apos;ll tell you one thing ,  it sure as hell ain &apos;t the andean mollatoosa . 
okay .   if you &apos;ve got a bug problem - a big one .   and they &apos;re swarming and there &apos;s no way to shoot them all individually .  .  .  how do you get rid of them ? 
nowhere . 
so .  .  .  now what ?   cattle call again ? 
nothing at all ?   now ?   last month ?  anything in the last few years ? 
in about 10 seconds they &apos;re gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute .

i know you &apos;re in a hurry ,  so i juiced up the nano - reconstruction around your new eyes . 
hence the expression .  .  . 
you &apos;re part of my flock now ,  john .  welcome . 
has the observer from justice shown up yet ? 
and this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it . 
if he &apos;s looking for a flaw in the system  -  - 
she &apos;s worried about you .   and ,  quite frankly ,  so am i . 
i can &apos;t .   they &apos;re following me right now .   they &apos;ll meet me there .  they &apos;ll halo me .

i don &apos;t know  -  -  i never saw his face .   all i know is ,  the next day i was out ,  so the guy must &apos;ve had juice somewhere .   look ,  man ,  you gotta go through with this . 
let go of the gun . 
just what is it you think i can do for you ? 
it began as play .   a guessing game like you play with any toddler ,  except these children always guessed right .   and then the nightmares started .  they were all different ,  but all the same .   they were all about murder .   and the murders were all happening . 
does burgess know about this ?  about the minority report ? 
you want to bring it down . 
you said they &apos;re destroyed . 
that &apos;s all ,  huh ?   just walk right into precrime ,  go into the temple ,  somehow tap into the precogs ,  and then download this minority report .  .  .

i haven &apos;t worn this damn thing in years .   i just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight . 
according to the sentry ,  anderton was watching this at containment right before he was tagged . 
of course ,  it would have to be someone with access to the prevision in the first place ,  someone fairly high up  -  - 
the information we need is embedded in the grain of wood .   and since each piece is unique ,  the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate . 
he looks familiar . 
we could have lunch together .

creasy .  pinta likes him . 
pinta likes him too much .   she thinks of him as a father . 
i &apos;ve just been so busy ,  lisa . 
it will be a hard break . 
pinta martin ramos is just a number to you .  tragic ,  a public outcry ,  but a number .  one more dead . 
we took them home alla way out in brooklyn .  her name was mary feeney .  what do you say ?  you think i oughta give her a ring ?  i &apos;ll take the skinny one . 
boy ,  you &apos;re getting to be a real drag ,  you know that ? 
there &apos;s a nice - looking little short one for you right now . 
where you been ,  for pete sakes ?  !  i been looking all over for you . 
waddaya gonna do now ? 
it &apos;s saturday night !  there &apos;s still plenty - a action around ! 
oh . 
i don &apos;t think i remember him . 
that &apos;s my son thomas &apos;s baby . 
when was this ? 
catherine ,  you are very dear to me .  we have cried many times together .  when my husband died ,  i would have gone insane if it were not for you .  i ask you to come to my house ,  because i can make you happy .  please come to my house . 
well ,  that &apos;s all .  you will see .  today ,  tomorrow ,  inna week ,  he &apos;s gonna say to you ,   &quot; hey ,  ma ,  it &apos;s no good being a single man .  i &apos;m tired - a running around .  &quot;  then he &apos;s gonna say ,   &quot; hey ,  ma ,  wadda we need this old house ?  why don &apos;t we sell this old house ,  move into a nicer parta town ?  a nice little apartment ?  &quot; 
yeah . 
i &apos;m a catholic ,  you know ,  and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin . 
well ,  the point is mr .  gazzara wantsa sell his shop now ,  because he and his wife are lonely ,  and they wanna move out to california in los angeles and live near their married daughter .  because she &apos;s always writing them to come out there .  so it &apos;s a nice little shop .  i handle his books for him ,  so i know he has a thirty - five percent markup which is not unreasonable ,  and he takes home net maybe a hundred ,  hundred and fifty bucks a week .  the point is ,  of course ,  you gotta worry about the supermarkets .  there &apos;s two inna neighborhood now ,  and there &apos;s an a&p coming in ,  at least that &apos;s the rumor .  of course ,  mosta his trade is strictly italian ,  but the younger italian girls ,  they get married ,  and they don &apos;t stick to the old italian dishes so much .  i mean ,  you gotta take that into account too . 
marty .  .  . 
you don &apos;t think my sister catherine should live in her daughter - in - law &apos;s house ? 
i &apos;m just gonna get my cigarettes .  i left them in my coat . 
and that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow ,  isn &apos;t he ? 
what i like about mickey spillane is he knows how to handle women .  in one book ,  he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car ,  and she throws a pass at him .  and then he meets two beautiful twins ,  and they throw passes at him .  and then he meets some beautiful society leader ,  and she throws a pass at him ,  and .  .  . 
don &apos;t worry about it .

all right ,  ginnie ,  don &apos;t get so excited . 
oh ,  he &apos;ll get married ,  don &apos;t worry ,  aunt theresa . 
aunt theresa ,  we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you &apos;re very lonely ,  see ?  and wouldn &apos;t she come and keep you company ,  because that way ,  you see .  .  . 
hello ,  aunt theresa .

hey . 
i wanted to get this out of the way . 
what do you think ? 
why don &apos;t you just stick your finger in and stir it up . 
it &apos;s not that world .  it &apos;s your world .  it &apos;s part of who you are . 
what about greg ?  what are you gonna tell him ? 
you like this place ? 
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re old and fat enough for me . 
i &apos;ve never seen sea so blue .  tahiti is magnificent ,  scottie .

what have you promised them ? 
your life that bad ? 
do you believe in miracles ? 
but this is impossible . 
you sure he &apos;s going to come ? 
how long ? 
the woman you &apos;re stuck on . 
corporate fingerprints all over it . 
be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person ,  then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need . 
then you had her killed . 
insurance ? 
identical .   one &apos;s you .   one &apos;s digital . 
but i don &apos;t know anything about programming . 
to see how long it would take for me to realize . 
and it meant something . 
what &apos;s so funny ? 
waiter ,  busboy ,  maitre - de  -  - 
alpha .   is there any way we can defeat this  monster ?   any way at all ? 
ay ,  yi ,  yi !   the rangers are going to be crushed ! 
impact in fifteen seconds ! 
the stealth eagle is about to fly . 
be the eagle .   be the eagle . 
the earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour ,  and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye . 
 .  .  .  a falcon ? 
hey ,  boss ! 
as soon as we &apos;ve taken over the world i &apos;m gonna change my name to sir mordant .   or how about major mordant ?  ! 
i &apos;m outta here . 
ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket . 
one fuckin &apos; year ago i had ta hit you up for train fare .  now i can buy the fuckin &apos; train .  and i ain &apos;t even a fuckin &apos; sicilian ! 
i &apos;m bobby clowes .  kansas city . 
we have a commission .  if there &apos;s a dispute over territory ,  the commission decides . 
i got my partner in there ! 
we &apos;ll start small .  when we got  &apos;em lined up ,  we increase the supply a bit at a time .  only sell the best stuff .  and keep the price high ,   &apos;cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze . 
masseria &apos;s confused .  he can &apos;t figure whether you &apos;re workin &apos; for maranzano ,  or gettin &apos; ready to kill the bastard .  so he &apos;s spreadin &apos; the word that you &apos;re goin &apos; after profaci because it happened on his turf .  i figure masseria &apos;s gonna try to rub out profaci ,  and pin it on us .  then maranzano will have to kill ya . 
masseria &apos;s tryin &apos; ta find a way around ya .  but his patience won &apos;t hold out much longer . 
have you thought about this ? 
a lot of shit came out of me in the hospital .  i &apos;m sorry you got hit by it . 
julius caesar never took no vote . 
tommy reina &apos;s gone over to maranzano ,  but so far masseria ain &apos;t lifted a finger , 
come off it ,  bugs . 
we got exactly two choices ,  maranzano or masseria . 
why &apos;s it gotta be tommy ! 
he &apos;ll think something &apos;s wrong i ain &apos;t there . 
every successor will owe his loyalty to us .  together we take out maranzano ,  and each family gets a piece of his operation . 
ya did good .  i ain &apos;t seen the boss so happy in weeks . 
not stupid .  fat . 
then perhaps you need to know me . 
salvatore .  my young caesar .  first me ,  sallie .  then you . 
at first ,  it will hurt you .  but you will come to understand and we will be strong together . 
the terms will be mine . 
tell it to the calabrian .  tell it to the jews . 
forget it .  that &apos;s past . 
those fucks can &apos;t leave each other alone .  maranzano and masseria ain &apos;t gonna be satisfied until one of  &apos;em starts a war . 
know something tommy ?  you &apos;re a mensch . 
 &quot; 4 / 17 :  subject ,  when unaware of observation ,  prefers to hold eating utensils .  .  . with feet .  successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils .  .  . with feet .  &quot;

death !  thank you ! 
comas are unpredictable .  he could wake up today ,  tomorrow ,  a month from now .  .  . 
three months .  < / i> there &apos;s always some brain damage .  but at three months .  .  . the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day . 
so here &apos;s my idea .  we do a giveaway at the zoo benefit .  we get a big piata .  we fill it with monkeybone dolls  -  hundreds< / u> of  &apos;em . 
holy shit . 
wait a minute .  stu miley ,  right ?  boys and girls  .  .  . mr .  stu miley ,  in the house< / u> !  < / i> this is an honor< / u> .  we see a lot of nightmares down here ,  but yours are like caviar< / u> ,  man .  you da shits< / u> !  !

land of death .  how do i get there ? 
sorry ,  steve ,  maybe next time .  and how &apos;s our new guest settling in  -   ? 
it &apos;s simple ,  stu .  we need nightmares  -  lots of  &apos;em .  so whenever we can swing it ,  we send a guy up to stimulate the flow .  .  . a nightmare maker< / u> !  like steve here .  poe .  rasputin .  .  . we &apos;ve been doing this all the way back to atilla and genghis khan ! 
oh ,  baby ,  i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re back . 
meaning me ,  of course .  i &apos;m referring to myself .  you have to assume monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise .  .  . 
oh yeah .  there &apos;s just one thing i don &apos;t get .   &quot; monkeybone creator awakens from coma &quot;  that &apos;s a big story !  that &apos;s front page news !  but i can &apos;t find a word< / u> of coverage in this stinkin &apos; rag !  < / i> hey .  don &apos;t i have a tv show ? 
stu ?  is that you ?  where did you go< / u> ?

he &apos;s ninety .  he &apos;s practically dead already .  how come he< / u> goes back and i< / u> stay here ? 
fate worse than death !  well ,  it &apos;s been real ,  boss ,  but i gotta go buff up my resum .  anybody here need a figment ? 
where &apos;d he go ?  ? 
i wanted to ask you something .   those motorcycles across the street  .  .  .  ?

the silver knight .  soul of honor -  - on a tight - rope . 
and i got him all dressed up ,  too -  -  to go way up in a balloon -  - so they can drop him a long way -  - make sure they break his heart .  why ,  not all the boy rangers in the world ,  working night shifts ,   &apos;ll be able to put humpty - dumpty together again -  -

well ,  he &apos;s still running the show ,  ain &apos;t he ,  dad ? 
uh -  - senator -  - i thought you and me might go out to dinner together -  - and grab off a few monuments . 
i addressed the chair first ,  sir ! 
will the senator yield for a question ? 
well -  - goodnight . 
ah ,  now ,  that &apos;s better . 
mr .  president -  -

just fine . 
well .  i hear you &apos;ve been right on your toes since you got here .  pitching right in .  lots of people took you for dumb -  - but they &apos;re wrong .  you &apos;re smart .  in fact ,  *i* think you &apos;re smart enough to understand a situation when it &apos;s explained to you -  - 
can &apos;t you ? 
good .  where are we ? 
pardon me -  - *this* is .  where are we now ? 
i did -  - and -  - and i got right up . 
about two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were !  mountains ,  prairie land ,  trees ,  streams !  a paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities -  -   you don &apos;t know that country out there ,  do you ,  miss saunders ? 
you mean -  - here ? 
it hasn &apos;t been easy ,  has it ? 
no -  - not today !  boy ,  i feel like a house afire !  saunders -  - how did i do ? 
what you *have* to do is fight ! 
ah !  that &apos;s more like it !  what ? 
whoa !  hold it !  pipe down !  come on ,  now -  - that &apos;s enough of that . 
since the time of adams -  - not washington . 
joe !  you *told* him to ! 
what do i *mean* ,  huh ?  uh -  - *i &apos;ll* tell ya -  - world &apos;s series -  - a pass !  in a month it &apos;s worth fifteen bucks ! 
well ,  that &apos;s out .  either it &apos;s *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or -  -  .  now will you go and call  &apos;em before i change my mind about the whole thing ! 
you want to see me ,  senator ? 
yes .  he went to mount vernon to give himself a patriotic address . 
nice *compliment* ! 
wait a minute ,  boys .  happy may have hit on something tremendous here .  rather than let miller or anyone else in at this stage ,  we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature -  -  and turn him loose on monuments .  he &apos;s completely out of the way in washington ,  and as happy says ,  you make political capital out of it at home . 
what do you think ? 
his first  &apos;whiff &apos; ! 
do i actually *see* this -  -  ? 
why ,  you own it ,  longfellow . 
he &apos;s still pixilated . 
no .  are you ? 
it &apos;s obviously a frameup !  they &apos;re trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him ! 
did you subsequently write a series of articles about him ? 
you fainted . 
tell me more about yourself . 
sure .  i met you . 
i told  &apos;em i &apos;d play along with them if they lowered their prices  -  and cut down expenses  -  and broadcast . 
there you are .  grant &apos;s tomb .  i hope you &apos;re not disappointed . 
what did you mean by that ? 
oh ,  yes .  i used to have a lot of fun there when i was a little girl .  i used to love to go fishing with my father .  that &apos;s funny .  he was a lot like you ,  my father was .  talked like you ,  too .  sometimes he &apos;d let me hold the line while he smoked  -  and we &apos;d just sit there for hours .  and after awhile ,  for no reason ,  i &apos;d go over and kiss him and sit in his lap .  he never said very much but once i remember him saying :   &quot; no matter what happens ,  honey ,  don &apos;t complain .  &quot; 
yes .  i can do  &quot; swanee river .  &quot;  would you like to hear me ? 
i wanted to thank you again for going out with me .   huh ?  well ,  i don &apos;t know what i &apos;d do without you .  you &apos;ve made up for all the fakes that i &apos;ve met .

did you see all this stuff in the papers ? 
sometimes it &apos;s the only solution . 
but what about this  &quot; cinderella man &quot;  ? 
you shouldn &apos;t be running away like this .  what &apos;s going to happen to the estate ? 
well ,  we were rather expecting it to come from you . 
common - law wife .  on top of that ,  there &apos;s a child . 
why ,  i turned them down ,  naturally . 
proceed . 
uh - huh . 
say fellow ,  you neglected me  -  and i feel very put out .   look ,  sock it right there ,  will you ?  lay one right on the button ,  &#93 6] but sock it hard . 
new mouthpiece .  been waiting two weeks for this .  kids keep swiping them all the time .  they use  &apos;em for bean shooters .   what can i do for you gentlemen ? 
you mean  by the neck or something ? 
it would be a nice night to go for a walk ,  don &apos;t you think ? 
she was a lady in distress .  she wouldn &apos;t let me help her .  got a lot of pride .  i like that . 
you came home last night  -  without them . 
why ,  that &apos;s an echo ,  sir ! 
why are they ganging up against me ? 
i said .  .  .  you must come out to the house for dinner on thursday . 
dr .  mumford . 
hello ,  mr .  cook .  i was wondering if sofie was around ? 
you &apos;re the shrink ,  aren &apos;t you ? 
but you do therapy ? 
but they &apos;re certainly dead .  and yes ,  personally ,  i find it a bit odd . 
what are you doing for lunch ? 
we &apos;re interested in any new therapies .  how would you characterize your approach ? 
i see . 
we got divorced .   i had to get rid of her .  she couldn &apos;t satisfy me . 
what is it ? 
uh ,  sorry ,  i &apos;m going to have to .  .  .    .  .  . i really appreciate what you &apos;re trying to .  .  .  uh ,  i can &apos;t thank you enough for .  .  . 
no .  .  .  i mean about althea .  about her .  .  .    .  .  . behavior .  do you think you can fix her up ? 
it was henry follett . 
what do you want to know ? 
they come through a few times each year .   hello ,  mrs .  saito ,  good to see you again !   it &apos;s a tour . 
doc .  .  . 
i don &apos;t want you to be mad at skip .  .  . 
skip and i wouldn &apos;t have got together if it weren &apos;t for you .  that &apos;s a big deal . 
 -  -  you crazy ?  you can &apos;t do this ! 
don &apos;t you at least have a back door i can use ? 
when did you start to feel this way ? 
that &apos;s okay .  maybe it is .  my mother always says  -  -   &quot; everything that &apos;s wrong with you is in your head .  &quot;  i suppose that &apos;s true . 
what would you do ? 
okay then .  .  .  are you positive your mother &apos;s a bitch ?   just kidding . 
i can give myself a headache instantly . 
you &apos;re purposely making me talk while we do this .  .  .    .  .  . because you think this is good for me .  .  .    .  .  . and you &apos;re a sadistic bastard .  .  . 
 .  .  . who thinks there &apos;s nothing really wrong with me . 
and i &apos;ll bet you can interpret the whole thing
it &apos;s all right . 
and this is legitimate therapy ? 
 -  -  you &apos;ve been a tremendous help to me . 
transference ! 
mother .  .  . 
you &apos;re doc mumford .   skip skipperton . 
this is great ! 
skip ,  you &apos;re the head of the whole deal here .  are they busier than you ? 
so ,  would you say we &apos;re out here .  .  .  let me think how to put this .  .  .  is your problem really that you &apos;re .  .  .  lonely ? 
lives downstairs from me .  she &apos;s got a great dog named for danny ainge . 
how many sessions have we had now ,  doc ?   six .  and it &apos;s been good .  .  .  like we were two buddies hanging out .  just shootin &apos; the shit . 
hey ,  maybe that &apos;s all right !  i don &apos;t know all that much about psychology or therapy or .  .  .  ethics ,  so maybe there &apos;s something i missed .  .  .  or something .  .  . 
all right ,  i &apos;m just gonna tell you ,  as simple and direct as i can .   and you understand that this is a big secret ?  just between us ?   okay .  you know i &apos;ve got this gift for certain kinds of .  .  .  machines . 
slash what ? 
damn !  what is your name ? 
i know it starts with a birth certificate .  .  . 
what about it ? 
jeez ,  man .  but you &apos;re good at it ! 
skip ,  i &apos;ve got a problem and i need some advice . 
doc !  .  .  .  it &apos;s not me ,  is it ? 
yes .  .  .  your particular approach . 
oh yes ,  of course . 
now go find me a big stick . 
where &apos;s your new friend ? 
the book !  the black book they found at hamunaptra !  imhotep wants it back .  said to me it would be worth it &apos;s weight in diamonds . 
 .  .  . and how do you say ?  those slimy things ,  in your stomach ? 
you put up with me ,  because i can read and write ancient egyptian ,  decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic ,  and i &apos;m the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library . 
the key !  ?  she has the lost key !  ? 
okay ,  let &apos;s cut to the chase .  he &apos;s afraid of cats ,  what &apos;s that about ? 
so your sayin &apos; ,  if we find the book made outta gold  -  - 
you think it &apos;ll send this guy back to hell ? 
see !  that proves it !  old seti &apos;s fortune &apos;s gotta be under this sand ! 
and what is he in prison for ? 
we uh ,  .  .  .  found .  .  .  your puzzle box ,  and we &apos;ve come to ask you about it . 
still angry that i kissed ya ,  huh ? 
did i miss something ?  are we going into battle ? 
evil .  the tuaregs and the bedouin believe that hamunaptra is cursed ,  they call it ,   &quot; the doorway to hell .  &quot; 
oh my god ,  it &apos;s a preparation room . 
you two ! 
is he supposed to look like that ? 
according to that book ,  once this creature has been reborn ,  his curse will spread ,  and as he grows in strength ,  so will his curse grow ,  infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed . 
it &apos;s everybody &apos;s problem ! 
that &apos;s what i am to you ?  a contract ? 
i &apos;m staying . 
yes .  the city of the dead .  where the early pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of egypt . 
you told me you found it on a dig down in thebes ! 
she &apos;s my sister ,  actually . 
damn - it !  that &apos;s two down and only two to go . 
believe it ,  sister .  that &apos;s what brought our buddy back to life . 
what ? 
um - hmm . 
what are you doing all alone in the dark ? 
our guests are waiting . 
and then one day ,  he didn &apos;t come home .  the police said it was an accident .  but cargo containers don &apos;t just fall on people .  he was murdered .  .  .  after that i fell apart .  i dropped out of school ,  became a mud wrestler ,  married and divorced a jerk .  when my mother died i hit bottom .  .  .  but then ,  when i was cleaning out her attic ,  i found my father &apos;s old bowling bag and costume ,  almost like he &apos;d left them there for me .  .  .  and i knew what i had to do . 
he was the last time i saw him . 
we could really use some coffee  -  - 
atta ,  girl ! 
hey ,  do i look like a man ? 
sounds good to me . 
that &apos;s two more than the fantastic four . 
eat your mustard . 
doc ,  these are my friends .  we &apos;re superheroes ,  and we need your help . 
have you considered my offer ? 
but times have changed ,  and you been in that bug house a long tine .  i can see you still got the style ,  but i dunno for sure you still got the edge . 
what did you do with captain amazing ? 
thanks for reminding me which team i &apos;m on . 
who &apos;s the artist ? 
then why are you here ? 
or talk ? 
sure . 
what &apos;s your real name ? 
you drink too much . 
oh don &apos;t start that again  -  - 
what are you talking about ? 
and it would be the right thing to do . 
your spiderman pez dispenser !  
cover me ! 
roy  -  - 
so you &apos;re only invisible .  .  .  to yourself ? 
are you famous ? 
jeffrey ! 
what are you doing in the silver drawer ? 
jeffrey ,  you thief ! 
and a social life . 
we &apos;ve got lift off ! 
it &apos;s a fine thing to establish policies but ,  when they don &apos;t work ,  they must be reconsidered .   granted that you have hurt england ,  but she is still on her feet .   and to seal off her trade with europe ,  what has it cost you ?   you have had to rule with an iron hand .   you have turned friends into enemies .   and even at that ,  the result has only been partly effective .   you have never been able to stop the extensive cheating ,  smuggling and corruption  -  -  even of your own officials .   but i should think the situation in spain ,  alone ,  would give your policy a minus balance .   you have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas ,  with no victory in sight .  and you have given england a dangerous foothold on the continent ,  for her armies . 
i hope you will forgive me ,  your majesty ,  for requesting an audience at such a late hour ,  but i have traveled all the way from moscow to see you ,  on a matter which cannot wait . 
you have my absolute assurance ,  your majesty ,  that napoleon does not have the strength to attack st .  petersburg now  -  -  his army is exhausted and ill - supplied ,  and he would be defeated if he attempted that . 
please .  .  . 
ah ,  my dear friend ,  come in ,  come in .   please sit down . 
to be perfectly honest ,  i haven &apos;t the vaguest idea . 
about 5 , 000 troops . 
well ,  i believe there are at least 30 guns at sablons . 
and where is the army ? 
but where are my wife and son ?  what &apos;s become of them ?   where is marmont ?   where is mortier ? 
i believe it was arranged by marshals mortier and marmont .   i must explain to you that we have had no orders all day .   each marshal has been keeping his own position . 
bastia  -  -  and you ? 
i haven &apos;t been there for three years . 
no ,  they &apos;re living in nice now . 
ah - hh ,  no . 
my god .  .  .  !   what time is it ? 
i told mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting . 
indeed you have ,  ambassador .   have you sent for a doctor ? 
no one can say how the emperor &apos;s thoughts work ,  ambassador ,  and unless we move quickly ,  he might change his mind again . 
that is correct . 
thank you . 
thank you ,  napoleon . 
well ,  it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street . 
only lisette ? 
the comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already . 
will you use the troops ? 
oh .  .  .  i see .   i understand .   how is .  .  .  the emperor ? 
may i offer you a drink ? 
oh ,  it &apos;s not the slightest inconvenience ,  general bonaparte .  it is an honor to have you here . 
were you in love with any of them ? 
yes  -  -  what is it ? 
don &apos;t be ridiculous and go away  -  -  i &apos;m busy working . 
how should i know .   ask roquier  -  -  he &apos;s cleaning her dress . 
i will be there in five minutes .   go back to your guests . 
yes !  ! 
oh  -  -  i didn &apos;t tell you .  .  .  i &apos;ve seen dr .  corvisart ,  and he was very reassuring and encouraging .   he has had excellent results with the waters of plombiers ,  and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there .  apparently ,  he sent madame le floch there last year ,  and she gave birth to twins . 
god damn it ,  junot ,  wouldn &apos;t you think i have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to joseph ? 
yes .  .  .  but ,  first ,  can i say something to you ,  as a friend ? 
i know that i shouldn &apos;t butt into things .  .  .  that are really no concern of mine .  .  .  but you shouldn &apos;t write a letter like that to joseph . 
look ,  junot ,  you aren &apos;t going to leave this room until you explain yourself . 
do you know what you &apos;re saying ? 
you mean you heard them making love ? 
can you give me a drink ,  please ? 
i wanted to kill him but joseph convinced me it would be a mistake .  he said people would say you hadn &apos;t the courage to deal with it yourself . 
good evening ,  ladies .   you must forgive me ,  my dearest wife ,  but i simply could not wait to see you . 
and ,  you ,  my dear wife ,  do you find that i resemble my portraits ? 
do you like music ? 
those are extremely harsh terms . 
i suggest that you leave with your men while you can . 
is he alone ? 
his moods at this time were complex and varied . 
if you see that boy again ,  bite off his ear off like mike tyson . 
well ,  let me in . 
no .   thought he was with you . 
me ,  too .   you think they &apos;re in there ? 
where &apos;s that boy that told me day - day was here ? 
naw ,  i already ate . 
sorry ,  bro ,  reflexes .   how did you do that ? 
nobody ! 
this you ? 
man ,  this a cool house . 
restraining order ?   where the hell you meet this girl ? 
damn ,  you got a stalker . 
you know what this is ? 
$247 . 
what we gonna do ? 
alright ,  roach ,  see you around . 
you make it sound so easy . 
i hope to god that dog is happy . 
karla . 
you did all this for me ? 
i did .   is that door locked ? 
what &apos;s the matter ? 
what it smell like ? 
yoooo ,  that &apos;s it .   you ain &apos;t as dumb as i think you are ,  roach . 
he &apos;s inside the house ? 
get  &apos;em ,  craig ! 
shut up !   both of you right now ! 
william . 
 &apos;take your car ?  &apos;
i got your message .   where &apos;s craig ? 
you didn &apos;t call the sandwich joint with a urgent message ? 
what about that ugly dog ? 
okay ,  okay ,  that &apos;s enough .   go put on some damn clothes . 
amtrack ? 
business or pleasure ? 
 &apos;s okay .  what do you think ? 
somebody close ? 
you shot her ? 
no . 
yes ,  you &apos;re right ,  i don &apos;t understand . 
he has to say  &quot; over and out &quot;  .  daddy ,  you have to say  &quot; over and out &quot;  . 
no ,  honey ,  not to be a hero .  but i want you to remember something for me ,  all right ? 
what do you do ,  if i may be so bold ? 
i have to do something . 
cover your mouth . 
this gorilla &apos;s watching you ,  is that right ? 
my daughter .  they have her in a van across the street .  they say they &apos;ll kill her if i don &apos;t do something for them . 
you said there was only one person you knew wasn &apos;t in on this thing . 
you &apos;re going to go see her . 
oh ,  we &apos;ll have to do better than that . 
where is he ?  did you lose him ? 
skate - boarders i don &apos;t mind ,  even though they dress like fuckin &apos; idiots ,  but when i see some pin - head on rollerblades ,  i get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with  &apos;em . 
god can &apos;t help her ,  mr .  watson .  only you can help her . 
that &apos;s enough . 
he never told about the money . 
where &apos;s your mom ? 
o ,  she &apos;s all right . 
here &apos;s your can o &apos; hooks ,  uncle birdie . 
won &apos;t he bust it ,  uncle birdie ? 
yes !  yes ! 
lynch him !  lynch him ! 
twenty - five wives ! 
that feller &apos;s just achin &apos; to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself . 
you go set down by the river . 
what could have possessed that girl ! 
now can i tell ? 
you swore ,  pearl ! 
pearl !  you ain &apos;t  -  -

tell me what ,  boy ? 
your mother says you tattled on me ,  boy .  she says you told her that i asked you where that money was hid . 
now it &apos;s your turn . 
o no !  your turn ! 
john &apos;s bad . 
can i have my supper please ? 
about our secrets . 
surely .  i &apos;d like to talk to you ,  my dear . 
you thought ,  willa ,  that the moment you walked in that door i &apos;d start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night .  ain &apos;t that right ,  now ? 
answer me ! 
you &apos;ll whip me ! 
this man down at the drugstore .  .  . 
miz cooper .  i never went to sewin &apos; lessons all them times . 
miz cooper ! 
nightmares are expected after psychological trauma .  don &apos;t worry ,  they go away . 
so we &apos;ll guard her together .  through the night .   in each others &apos; arms like we always said . 
what the hell &apos;s going on !  ? 
guess i did . 
okay ? 
yeah .  so ? 
coming up on the seventh day .  it &apos;s okay ,  i checked guiness .  the record &apos;s eleven ,  and i &apos;ll beat that if i have to .   listen ,  i .  .  .  i know who he is . 
i can save you the trouble .  you &apos;re nutty as a fruitcake .  i love you anyway . 
he &apos;s dangerous . 
lieutenant thompson .  sorry to wake you ,  but  -  - 
get outside and watch her house .  if you see anything funny call me . 
nancy ,  don &apos;t fall asleep in there . 
get into bed . 
go even crazier ? 
your old man thinks i did it ,  don &apos;t he ? 
nice to have a fire . 
maybe we should call rod ,  have him come over too .  he might get jealous . 
when did you have a nightmare ? 
thank you ,  comrade . 
well ,  here are fifty francs . 
i know .  .  .  my heart is sad .  .  .  but my feet are happy .  when all the tanks and guns were roaring over the red square i sat here all by myself and played a beethoven sonata .  not bad at all .   are you expecting someone ? 
what are you serving ? 
an omelet !  aren &apos;t you living a little above your ration ? 
and you too ,  ninotchka . 
that &apos;s just it .  it makes people feel queer .  i dont &apos; want you to get in any trouble . 
it was very silly .  .  .  .  i would be ashamed to wear it here . 
can you blame them ?  .  .  .  at least the may day parade is over . 
it is ,  ninotchka !  it is !  he must have been in paris !  you can see it in his whole attitude !  he just picked up a crumb of our black bread ,  shook his head ,  and dropped it . 
we are not comrades any more .  .  .  we are friends ,  ninotchka . 
we don &apos;t like razinin . 
and if it is too late for you your children will eat it . 
is there anything i can do ,  comrade ? 
all you have to do is say  &quot; open sesame .  &quot; 
guest ? 
boys ,  boys .  .  .  don &apos;t forget russia is your mother country .  three sons walking out all at once .  .  .  that &apos;s too much for any mother . 
good morning ,  your highness . 
a blue shirt ,  perhaps ? 
i guess it is eight forty - two . 
and gaston ,  i was happier all day long .  i felt i &apos;d contributed something . 
i can &apos;t follow you ,  gaston ,  isn &apos;t it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position ?  you being my servant ?  wouldn &apos;t you like to stand on an equal footing with me ? 
oh ,  you &apos;re a reactionary !  don &apos;t you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say ,   &quot; hey ,  you ,  d &apos;algout !  from now on it &apos;s going to be share and share alike &quot;  ? 
your highness .  .  . 
they hope the settlement will bring you a fortune . 
is this satisfactory ? 
we can wait . 
this is a fine thing .  maybe we &apos;ve missed him already . 
they tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor . 
that was our idea when we first came .  all we thought we would get out of this trip was a turkish bath ,  but .  .  .  we learned better . 
there &apos;s something in constantinople .  .  .  something irresistible .  .  .  . 
she says she won &apos;t be intimidated by parasites .  she called the duchess a blood - sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer . 
 .  .  . we have a wonderful electric sign :   &quot; dine with buljanof ,  iranoff ,  and kopalski .  &quot; 
pardon me ,  i am very interested in what you just said  -  -  you mean when an envoy goes back to russia  -  -  if they don &apos;t like what he has done they put him out of the way ? 
listen ,  i want to be absolutely frank with you .  i have no business in moscow . 
thank you . 
why do you need my finger ? 
for my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale ? 
four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty - six feet on the side of the seine ,  and twenty -  nine and one - half feet on the other side .  the girders of interlaced iron -  work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty - four degrees .  .  . 
and what is your profession ? 
that is why i believe in the future of my country . 
that is correct . 
you don &apos;t have to do a thing .  chemically we are already quite sympathetic . 
do you hear that ? 
it &apos;s midnight .  one half of paris is making love to the other half .  look at the clock .  one hand has met the other hand .  they kiss .  isn &apos;t that wonderful ? 
thank you . 
i must go . 
i was sent here by my country to fight you . 
it seemed funny to me when i first heard it .  maybe the trouble isn &apos;t with the joke .  maybe it &apos;s with you ! 
he sits down at the table and says to the waiter .  .  .  did you get that too ? 
it &apos;s nine o &apos;clock . 
did you make any change in this room ? 
i suppose she is very entertaining .  .  .  it must be lots of fun to be with her ,  so witty ,  so glamorous .  .  . 
quickly ,  please .  .  .  tell me one of your funny stories . 
go on . 
wonderful  -  -  if one could believe it . 
quite right .  .  .  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  but first you &apos;re going in that door and you &apos;re going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down . 
there it is .  .  .  thursday .  .  .  you can &apos;t rip it out of the week .  .  .  . 
come ,  sweetheart .  let me put it on you .  you will teach these jewels .  for the first time they will learn how they can look . 
trying to keep me away from you !  it couldn &apos;t be done .  naturally i couldn &apos;t go on forever punching passport officials in the nose  -  -  but i found a way ,  didn &apos;t i ?  darling ,  i had to see you .  i wrote and wrote but all my letters came back . 
now .  .  .  here we have two very handsome soft - boiled eggs .  do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs ?  probably not .  they have such unfeeling eyes .  we &apos;ll put in a great nugget of butter ,  plenty of pepper and salt .  .  .  darling ,  i haven &apos;t seen you for three livelong days .  .  .  seventy - two hours ! 
you haven &apos;t seen her yet ? 
that proletarian !  in the old days we &apos;d have had her flogged . 
i &apos;ve some wonderful news for you ,  leon .  it &apos;s about punchy .  .  .  do you mind if i sit down ? 
is this ,  by any chance ,  going to be a confession ? 
all right ,  i &apos;ll listen . 
and i thought it was something serious !  how could you frighten me so ? 
knowing the efficiency of the french air service i think i can guarantee that madame yakushova has already taken off for moscow . 
good morning . 
i think we can cut your visit short .  leon is not here . 
i just dropped in to have a little heart - to - heart talk with you . 
i wouldn &apos;t waken leon .  after last night i would say not before three o &apos;clock at the earliest . 
where are they ? 
you leave me no choice . 
they always belonged to the russian people .  they were paid for with their sweat ,  their blood ,  their lives and you will give them back ! 
now ,  let &apos;s free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way .  our situation has changed considerably .  before i had only a claim to the jewels .  now i have the jewels . 
may i have your bags ,  madame ? 
does this include the products of the far eastern provinces ? 
i haven &apos;t either ,  but i &apos;ve heard about them .  you must realize it was only on the strength of your paris report that i sent them to constantinople; without that i never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal . 
i think this is the first time you have been to my little place .  your face is new to me .  now ,  what shall it be ? 
where to ,  madame ? 
no ,  madame ,  something of the utmost importance .  .  .  it concerns your jewels . 
i remember one birthday of his majesty ,  our beloved czar .  .  .  i had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace .  .  .  i still see you bending before his majesty .  .  .  you wore your diadem and a necklace .  .  .  your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels . 
sir ,  the charges are serious  -  -  first ,  abuse of power; second ,  obstruction of justice; third ,  failure to cooperate with congress; and last ,  bombing cambodia  .  .  . 
uh ,  he &apos;s rushing back from his tennis game ,  sir  .  .  . 
i understand that ,  sir . 
yeah  .  .  .  sullivan thinks henry &apos;s leaking .   he &apos;s the one  .  .  . 
it &apos;s a code or something . 
hunt ?   howard hunt ? 
excuse me  .  .  .  are you talking about recognizing china ,  mr .  president ?  that would cost us our strongest support . 
the soldiers were provoked .   the students started it ,  for christ &apos;s sake ! 
he &apos;s begging for a meeting ,  chief .   he wants to go overseas for awhile . 
this is june twentieth ? 
you &apos;re all set ,  sir .   just push this button .   good night ,  mr .  president . 
it &apos;s the president &apos;s personal property !   i will never give up my tapes to a bunch of kennedy - loving harvard democrat cocksuckers ! 
about a dozen . 
the army ? 
sir ,  you talked about opening up the whole  &quot; bay of pigs &quot;  thing again . 
their fourth ! 
but what are we paying him for ? 
we &apos;ve got to turn off the fbi .   you just go to the cia ,  bob ,  and tell helms that howard hunt is blackmailing the president .   tell him that hunt and his cuban friends know too damn much ,  and if he goes public ,  it would be a fiasco for the cia .   he &apos;ll know what i &apos;m talking about . 
pat gray &apos;ll do anything we ask him .  that &apos;s why i appointed him . 
i suppose you thought the presidency was above this sort of thing . 
this isn &apos;t a  &quot; moral &quot;  issue ,  bob .   we have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes .   the fbi is filled with people who are pissed that i put gray in and not one of their own .   vietnam ,  china ,  the soviet union :  when you look at the big picture ,  bob ,  you &apos;ll see we &apos;re doing a hell of a lotta good in this world .   let &apos;s not screw it up with some shit - ass ,  third - rate burglary . 
i think  .  .  .  i think  .  .  .  that &apos;s the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that  .  .  .  helping the cuban exiles who oppose castro would ,  uh  .  .  .  not only be a violation of international law ,  it would be  .  .  . 
i don &apos;t understand .   track 2 &apos;s chile ? 
he didn &apos;t veto it .   i ran the white house side .   the mob contact was johnny roselli .   one of the cia guys was that jackass ,  howard hunt . 
sir ? 
but ,  hell ,  this is nothing compared to venezuela .   when i was vice president ,  ike sent me down there like a blocking back .   they threw rocks ,  broke out our windows ,  almost overturned the car .  read six crises ,  bob .   boy ,  pat was brave ! 
mr .  president ! 
she understood something it &apos;s taken me twenty - five fucking years in politics to understand .   the cia ,  the mafia ,  the wall street bastards  .  .  . 
because they &apos;re not americans . 
we could leverage helms . 
i promised iran to townsend . 
richard  .  .  .  come with me ,  would you  .  .  . 
because harold tests thy father &apos;s will is no reason to admire him .   let harold &apos;s worldliness be a warning to thee ,  not an example . 
please !   i &apos;ll never let you down again ,  mother .   never .   i promise . 
we haven &apos;t said grace yet .   richard . 
robert cushman is a lieutenant general in the marine corps ,  the deputy director of the cia  .  .  .  and this is what you use him for ? 
president kennedy threatened to smash the cia into a thousand pieces .   you could do the same  .  .  . 
current levels may not be sufficient . 
mr .  castro . 
mr .  helms ,  we &apos;ve lived with communism in cuba for ten years  .  .  . 
by offering cuba to the russians as a consolation prize ? 
 .  .  .  little bobby . 
we can &apos;t keep a goddamn secret in this government ,  edgar .   they &apos;re stealing papers right out of his office . 
yeah ,  you do .   i &apos;d be bugging myself ,  edgar  .  .  .  who &apos;d get the tapes ? 
this damned tie  .  .  .  will you help me ,  edgar ?   churchill used to say to me ,   &quot; if you want your own history written properly ,  you must write it yourself .  &quot;   all right ,  edgar ,  but just don &apos;t let it come back to haunt me . 
why ,  you got a customer ? 
who we working for ? 
like you said jack ,  i &apos;m just a new york lawyer now . 
hell ,  kennedy &apos;s pissed cuba away to the russians .   and he don &apos;t know what the hell he &apos;s doing in vietnam .   these are dangerous times ,  dick ,  especially for business  .  .  . 
it looks like to me we &apos;re gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and ,  dick ,  goddamn it ,  you &apos;re going along with it ,  buying into this kissinger bullshit  -  -   &quot; detente &quot;  with the communists .    &quot; detente &quot;   -  -  it sounds like two fags dancing . 
it &apos;s your people who are leaking to the times .   wasn &apos;t this ellsberg a student of yours at harvard ?   he was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover ? 
that doesn &apos;t matter now ,  henry .   the point is ,  you might lose some of your media - darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry . 
do you miss cuba ,  manolo ? 
i don &apos;t know .   he made me see the stars  .  .  . 
how about kissinger along with him ? 
let &apos;s get out of here; it &apos;s too painful .   i hate it .   we went bowling last weekend .   next weekend we &apos;re going to the zoo .  whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit . 
 .  .  .  give me a break ,  mary . 
edgar ,  wonderful to see you .   clyde  .  .  .  hi . 
 .  .  .  but it depends on what i &apos;m doing to the music ,  dick  .  .  . 
we got the press this time ! 
proud ? 
and this ?  !   good lord ,  have you lost your mind ?   nixon can &apos;t say this .   &quot; niggers &quot;  ! 
you &apos;re not a failure ,  dick . 
i &apos;ll concede in the morning . 
i &apos;ll do it .   no more . 
you don &apos;t have to go . 
were you planning to tell me ? 
this .   above all . 
he looked old ,  didn &apos;t he ? 
i remember alger hiss .   i know how ugly you can be  -  -  you &apos;re capable of anything .   but you see ,  it doesn &apos;t really matter ,  at the end of the day ,  what &apos;s on them .   because you have absolutely no remorse .   no concept of remorse .   you want the tapes to get out ,  you want them to see you at your worst  .  .  . 
won or lost ? 
write .   you know ,  a book .   i &apos;m calling it  &quot; six crises .  &quot;   it &apos;s a good thing ,  rocky  -  -  take some time off to write . 
what ? 
let &apos;s wait and see how you survive your first crisis ,  rocky  .  .  . 
well ,  in any case ,  rocky ,  i &apos;ll send you my book .    &quot; six crises .  &quot;

wise beyond her years ,  i &apos;m sure ,  and such poise ,  too .   very ,  very impressive .  .  . 
and then we &apos;re gonna do her right here .  right ?

good man .   good pirate .   and clever  -  -  i never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him .  when you were puzzling out that cell door ,  it was like seeing his twin . 
you think your father is the only man who ever lived the glasgow life ,  telling folk one thing ,  and then going off to do another ?  there &apos;s quite a few who come here ,  hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life .  and they &apos;re all  &apos;merchant marines .  &apos;
go to the opposite end of the island ,  and signal the ship .   i &apos;ll keep  &apos;em busy . 
will  -  -  don &apos;t do anything stupid !  don &apos;t say anything stupid  -  - 
there &apos;s no *real* ship as can match the interceptor . 
he &apos;s still breathing . 
well ,  she had a very taxing day .  .  .  ghastly weather tonight . 
but  -  - 
what are you going to do to him ? 
 .  .  .  plastic . 
it works ,  poppy .   it works ,  it works ! 
oh no .   no .   we &apos;ll get her assistant .   what &apos;s - his - name ?  nebbishman ? 
you know how i feel about you .   you know how much i need you .   how much i trust you .   i would do anything for you . 
consideration ? 
i was wondering if you &apos;d finished considering ? 
the fact is ,  that the milk has been spilled and now we need you to tell us how to clean it up . 
they &apos;re here !   they &apos;re here !   we have the nanobot . 
excellent work ,  dr .  nebbleman .   you have outdone yourself . 
it &apos;ll be better for us if he simply disappears .   the gardener will know what to do . 
what ?   oh ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  nigel .   i was just thinking .  .  . 
yeah ,  somebody broke in and stole the samples ,  one of those animal rights groups ,  right ?   i remember now ,  they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the massachusetts turnpike ,  right ? 
what are you going to do ? 
you were never invited to my house . 
is that what argon told you ? 
what &apos;s it smell like ? 
sir ,  please try to hold still . 
i &apos;ve been thinking about you a lot all these years ,  locked up in my cell .   i &apos;d tear through every issue of the midwest science journal looking for your latest findings ,  watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies ,  the fruit fly .   exciting stuff .   i got to tell you ,  it really kept me going . 
daniel ,  give him the trix . 
susie !   you gotta help me ! 
oh god ,  please !   this can &apos;t be happening !   i can &apos;t be plastic !   a plastic man ?  ! 
pills .  .  .  you know how i feel about pills . 
why do we need it ? 
that was an egg ? 
i think while we &apos;re waiting ,  we had better run some basic diagnostics on you . 
is something wrong ? 
just look at it ! 
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ? 
victim my ass !   you stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage !   maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved ! 
come on ,  i don &apos;t see you living in a cave ! 
that &apos;s pretty good . 
who is he ? 
oh no !   argon !   we have to stop him before he uses the nanobot !   we have to get the nanobot ! 
this is wonderfully accommodating of you all .   now i won &apos;t have to come looking for you . 
oh yeah ,  he &apos;s alive .   technically . 
look ,  as i have said and will continue to say ,  the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority  -  - 
if you don &apos;t have any questions ,  i &apos;ll let you get back to doing your job . 
well ,  what else do you expect them to call you ? 
don &apos;t mind mother . 
you &apos;re not going to print this silly thing ,  are you ? 
you know something ,  lady ,  if you sold life insurance ,  i &apos;d go for a policy in sixty seconds . 
may i use your telephone ? 
i &apos;m not interested in your literary recommendations . 
i &apos;m just beginning to believe that something could be done with you . 
your place ? 
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house
oh ,  mother will give us the blue room .  you haven &apos;t a red room ,  have you ?   well ,  bless her heart .  wouldn &apos;t that be nice !  my ,  oh my  -  six rooms and two baths and a blue room .  i guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it ,  wouldn &apos;t she ? 
look anne ,  you &apos;re not serious about this ,  are you ? 
i &apos;ve got a present .  shut your eyes .  keep  &apos;em closed .  i know you &apos;re going to love them . 
darling ,  i don &apos;t care whether you can look gallagher in the face or not ,  but you &apos;re gonna be a good boy and wear garters . 
oh ,  yes you will my dear  -  oh ,  yes you will my dear  -  you &apos;ll wear garters and you &apos;ll like it too ! 
oh ,  yes you will my dear  -  oh ,  yes you will my dear  -  you &apos;ll eat spinach but you &apos;ll wear garters too ! 
is this true ,  stewart ?  did you really say it ? 
i &apos;m not going ! 
what &apos;s the idea ,  anne ? 
now wait ,  don &apos;t get excited ,  anne .  there &apos;s no reason for that .  perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink .  that &apos;s all right .  i &apos;m sorry .  i &apos;ll go right down and throw them out .  that &apos;s no reason for you to take this attitude .  after all ,  i certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house ,  haven &apos;t i ? 
and if it &apos;s all the same to you ,  i &apos;m moving out . 
oh ,  the usual thing .  blah ,  blah ,  blah attended the blah ,  blah reception and wore the same blah ,  blah things . 
you don &apos;t have anything to complain about ,  mother .  he was all right last night ,  wasn &apos;t he ?  i told you not to worry about him . 
a beautiful pair of shoulders !  but listen now ,  as a favor ,  will you please make it snappy ,  laughing waters ,  &#93 14] and tell stew smith i gotta see him because if you don &apos;t my whole family &apos;s going to die . 
yale  &apos;21 ,  i believe . 
is that so ?  well ,  have you seen enough  -  or would you like a photograph ? 
do you know what to do in a drawing -  room ? 
now listen ,  we &apos;ve got a tip that the schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame . 
how do you like your bath ,  sir ? 
what are you doing fooling around in here ? 
all right ,  outside ! 
you &apos;re sure going to be poison to that junior leaguer &#93 4] from now on ! 
you what ? 
well ,  i &apos;ve seen her pictures ,  and i don &apos;t think she &apos;s so hot . 
well ,  well ,  well !  gallagher ,  old pal !  there you are .  what did you run away for ? 
don &apos;t pay attention to him ,  stew .  he doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;s talking about . 
how far have you gotten ? 
did who ? 
now ,  we &apos;ve got it right up to where the boy &apos;s wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters  -  how &apos;s that ? 
how about my breakfast ?  how do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach ? 
i think you &apos;d better go . 
well ,  at best you might deny it . 
i suppose you know why i came ? 
thanks .  may i sit down ? 
anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce . 
wait a minute .  do i get from you that she wants to pay me alimony ? 
yes .

hey . 
they need to be scanned individually .  they each have a bar code ,  so i need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt .  .  . 
each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that .  .  . it &apos;s for a giveaway .  .  . a product giveaway by this company .  .  .

this is this place called ace vintage ,  you gotta find it ,  i don &apos;t know exactly where this is and i don &apos;t understand these maps so just go there and check it out .  it &apos;s a  &apos;61 ac cobra that this old guy says is fine ,  but i need to figure out why he &apos;s only asking 23 for it .  so take a look ,  the whole thing ,  call me about that ,  if it seems alright then i &apos;ll head down there and check it out . 
just tell him to call me . 
so .  .  . did my brother call you ? 
i hear he &apos;s got a whetstone and chisel ,  and he uses them to sharpen his teeth . 
if you &apos;re going to slander him ,  then you don &apos;t deserve to hear his stories  -  - 
has he hurt you ? 
i put myself in his stories .  i play the parts .  each strumpet ,  each murderess . 
charenton has changed; it &apos;s not safe for you here . 
it &apos;s a sin against god for me to refuse your kindness .  but my heart &apos;s held fast here .  .  . 
i &apos;m entertaining you now ,  aren &apos;t i ? 
you mean to take us all down with you ? 
what the devil  -  - 
perhaps  -  -  in time  -  -  you &apos;ll earn them back through good behavior  -  - 
off with your clothes ! 
i do not mean to flirt ,  marquis ! 
don &apos;t confuse one organ with another  -  - 
go to hell ! 
surely you &apos;ll grant me a final word . 
indiscretions ,  abbe ?  please .  i &apos;ve read his case history .  at sixteen ,  he violated a serving girl with a crucifix .  after six months in the dungeon at vincennes ,  he mutilated a prostitute ,  cutting her flesh with a razor ,  then cauterizing the wounds with wax  -  - 
he no longer roars or spits .  he no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards  -  - 
he &apos;ll do no such thing . 
how is the patient faring ? 
but i am history . 
quickly ,  my suckling ,  out of your clothes !  my scepter awaits; how solid it grows ! 
 &quot; the vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge .  still ,  he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman .  .  .  &quot; 
you &apos;ve already stolen my heart ,  as well as another more prominent organ ,  south of the equator .  .  . 
the story &apos;s thrilling conclusion comes at a premium . 
my newest book begins at my right cuff ,  continues across my back ,  and completes itself at the base of my left shoe .  .  . 
they &apos;ve taken your clothes ? 
surely you &apos;ve seen a man naked . 
the abbe &apos;s sending me away .  he fears for me here ,  what with the likes of you  -  - 
yes; that &apos;s it !  a final volley from us both ! 
 -  -  whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet !  there ,  armed with a quill of my own ,  i &apos;ll commit it to paper ! 
i beg to differ ,  doctor .  you work in a madhouse .  your every waking moment is governed by the insane . 
if you &apos;re truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband &apos;s celebrity  -  - 
good god ,  marquise  -  - 
leave at once  -  - 
we &apos;ve known each other too long ,  orson .  sling the bullshit elsewhere . 
and we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t - t -  teeth and i &apos;m just imagining plague lice jumpin &apos; all over the damn place so we set t - t - traps everywhere .  and every morning we would find the t - t - traps sprung but no mice ! 
that &apos;s why he has the parties ,  he says it &apos;s like bringing the world to me . 
yeah .  but all of a sudden it &apos;s not
who are you ,  sir ?

how does one get 125 million dollars in debt ? 
you don &apos;t have any money left ,  okay ?  !  that &apos;s the truth .  i don &apos;t wanna say it ,  nobody else will say it ,  but it &apos;s the truth .  you spent it all .  you can &apos;t buy the tribune in chicago  -  -  you can &apos;t buy ^ g - g -  goddamn thing .  now you better face up to it -  - 
castle  -  -  still fighting old battles he will never win with pulitzer and roosevelt and hollywood -  -

it don &apos;t look right . 
i &apos;m not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out ,  he will kill you .  what &apos;s the matter with you ?  aren &apos;t you happy ?  you got everything you want . 
like disposing of their wives ? 
i &apos;ll admit it all has a mysterious sound  -  -  but is could mean a number of different things .  murder is the least likely . 
feel a little foolish ? 
if possible  -  -  both . 
i know what you told me !  she went in to get evidence ,  and she came out with it . 
like mrs .  thorwald &apos;s wedding ring .  if that woman were still alive ,  she &apos;d be wearing it . 
okay .  when do i leave ?  half - hour ?  an hour ? 
stop sounding stuffy .  i &apos;ll take pictures from a jeep .  from a water buffalo if necessary . 
i &apos;ll send you some comic books . 
now stop wasting time ,  thorwald ,  or i &apos;ll hang up and call the police . 
you must be kidding .  a beautiful young woman ,  and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood . 
that &apos;s abnormal . 
behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause .   what is it ?  you have a fight ? 
and she &apos;ll end up fat ,  alcoholic and miserable . 
isn &apos;t there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction ? 
he and his wife splitting up ? 
there &apos;s a dip at this end .  and since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks ? 
not yet ,  jeff . 
how &apos;s your leg ? 
and your stomach ? 
anything else bothering you ? 
the lisa fremont who never wears the same dress twice ? 
that dress should be listed on the stock exchange . 
it &apos;s opening night of the last depressing week of l .  b .  jefferies in a cast . 
and it &apos;s deflating to find out that the only way i can be part of it  -  -  is to take out a subscription to your magazine .  i guess i &apos;m not the girl i thought i was . 
not quite  -  -  it seems .   goodbye ,  jeff . 
not that salesman &apos;s wife .  and why didn &apos;t he go to work today ? 
yeah . 
no comment . 
okay ,  chief .  what &apos;s my next assignment . 
he had it hidden in the dresser !  well ,  at least it was in there .  he took it out ,  went to the phone and called somebody long distance .   -  -  his wife &apos;s jewelry was in the handbag .  and something about it worried him .  he was asking somebody advice over the phone . 
i &apos;d like to see your friend &apos;s face when we tell him .  he doesn &apos;t sound like much of a detective . 
you are .  you have a talent for creating difficult situations .

suppose mrs .  thorwald &apos;s wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag .   during that phone conversation he held up three rings  -  -  one with a diamond  -  -  one with a big stone of some kind  -  -  and one plain gold band .

a cowboy .  you &apos;re going to send me into an indian casino disguised as a cowboy .  have you thought this entirely through ?

they had the weapons and the willpower .  we just gave them their inside man .

i don &apos;t buy it .  it doesn &apos;t make sense . 
we were set up ,  the cops were waiting for us . 
brown &apos;s dead ,  we don &apos;t know about blue . 
go ahead and laugh ,  you know what i mean .  what a while bitch will put up with ,  a black bitch won &apos;t put up with for a minute .  they got a line ,  and if you cross it ,  they fuck you up . 
the way they talk to each other .  you can tell they &apos;re buddies .

i gotta memorize all this shit ? 
 .  .  . her brother usually goes with her ,  but he &apos;s in county unexpectedly . 
let &apos;s go over it .  where are you ? 
hey ,  fuck all that ,  i &apos;m making a point here .  you &apos;re gonna make me lose my train of thought . 
for the past fifteen minutes now ,  you &apos;ve just been droning on with names .   &quot; toby .  .  .  toby .  .  .  toby .  .  .  toby wong .  .  .  toby wong .  .  .  toby chung .  .  .  fuckin &apos; charlie chan .  &quot;  i got madonna &apos;s big dick outta my right ear ,  and toby jap i - don &apos;t - know - what ,  outta my left .

don &apos;t worry ,  eddie .  me and larry have been friends a long time ,  he ain &apos;t gonna shoot .  we like each other too much . 
okay ramblers ,  let &apos;s get to rambling .  wait a minute ,  who didn &apos;t throw in ? 
he don &apos;t believe in it ?   you don &apos;t believe in it ? 
what &apos;s this guy &apos;s problem ? 
follow you where ? 
fuck jail !  i don &apos;t give a shit about jail .  but i can &apos;t die .  you don &apos;t have to take me in .  just drive me up to the front ,  drop me on the sidewalk .  i &apos;ll take care of myself .  i won &apos;t tell them anything .  i swear to fucking god ,  i won &apos;t tell  &apos;em anything .  look in my eyes ,  look right in my eyes .   i - won &apos;t - tell - them - anything .  you &apos;ll be safe . 
can you believe the songs they been playin &apos; ? 
i &apos;d go over twelve percent for that . 
waitressing is the number one occupation for female non - college graduates in this country .  it &apos;s the one job basically any woman can get ,  and make a living on .  the reason is because of tips . 
what &apos;s wrong with it ? 
i don &apos;t wanna kill anybody .  but if i gotta get out that door ,  and you &apos;re standing in my way ,  one way of the other ,  you &apos;re gettin &apos; outta my way . 
at that point it became every man for himself .  as far as mr .  blonde or mr .  blue are concerned ,  i ain &apos;t got the foggiest .  once i got out ,  i never looked back . 
so what is it ? 
he seems all right now ,  but he went crazy in the store . 
what &apos;s she doin &apos; runnin &apos; around the country at night . 
tell them to come on in . 
and this is helen carter . 
if you were in his shoes would you take one of us home ? 
steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire . 
like what ? 
they &apos;re stragglin &apos; . 
so that was why she tried to run away . 
i hope you get everything you want out of life  -  - 
he knows his alphabet . 
some of  &apos;em you didn &apos;t mean but most of  &apos;em you did .  i don &apos;t blame you because i understand your way of thinking and why you think that way .  you want your women on pedestals .  but they have to be born on  &apos;em  -  -  they can fall off but they can &apos;t climb back up . 
goodbye .  thanks for the lift . 
i found their surrey  -  - 
do you have to be so close - mouthed ?  i &apos;m your brother .  and i &apos;m ridin &apos; with you .  remember ? 
can i have my gun back ? 
you know what she asked me ? 
half of them are mine . 
i guess so  -  -  but don &apos;t make a habit of it . 
yeah ,  how did you know ? 
you can &apos;t stay here .  there &apos;s snakes and it &apos;s cold and you &apos;ll just get sicker . 
it isn &apos;t like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of . 
how long do you think we &apos;ll have to stay here ? 
you said somebody was comin &apos; back  -  -  who &apos;s comin &apos; back ? 
we got to get movin &apos; . 
because there &apos;s a man i want to see . 
what comes after z ? 
well ,  steve ? 
don &apos;t pay any attention to him .  that &apos;s his way and i &apos;ve found he &apos;s sure easy to get along with .  i don &apos;t recollect him havin &apos; hit me more &apos;n a couple of times and i guess i had it comin &apos; . 
no ,  i won &apos;t let you do it . 
that &apos;s it . 
my favorite memory was when we  -  - 
ouch !  ! 
cindy ,  what &apos;s going on ? 
so ,  i guess i can go now . 
you sure ? 
but ,  hey ,  maybe we can be friends . 
gentle stuff like talking ,  sharing thoughts and ideas ,  secrets and past experiences .  stuff like that ,  you know . 
cindy ,  i &apos;ve been thinking about this whole friend thing .  i never had a friend that cares for me the way you do .  .  .  i mean ,  there &apos;s ray ,  but he cares for me in a different way .  you know ,  bringing me flowers .  running my bath water .  and then there &apos;s nights i wake up screaming and i look over and ray &apos;s in my bed .  holding me .  and seeing that tonight might be our last night together ,  i was thinking .  .  . 
like ,  i &apos;ve always wanted to walk on the moon . 
there &apos;s something i really want to share with you . 
i don &apos;t want to be your friend like this anymore . 
good - night ,  cin .  i &apos;ll be next door if you need me . 
let her go ,  cin . 
where &apos;s shorty ? 
morphine ?  chloroform ?  horse tranquilizers ?  you &apos;ve drugged him ! 
hanson ,  please . 
tell me ,  cindy .  would you ever tell me  &quot; stop .  if you loved me you &apos;d stop .  &quot; 
this can &apos;t be happening ? 
noooo !  !  ! 
he won &apos;t let us go .  he &apos;s going to kill us . 
father ! 
hey ,  y &apos;all !  what &apos;s going on ? 
yippie !  wasn &apos;t that amazing ? 
good idea ,  and don &apos;t forget to give her a good - night kiss . 
as i am sure you are aware ,  professor ,  subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation ,  which is ,  of course ,  why i &apos;ve given them special consideration . 
fantastic .  these kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken hell house . 
professor ! 
so ,  if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do i press to get a close -  up ? 
not to worry .  there &apos;s been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years . 
professor ,  we need to talk . 
i think we should consider cutting the experiment short . 
the force in this house is far greater than i anticipated .  in one night i recorded cold spots ,  shifting magnetic fields ,  the e . u . p .  is picking up white sounds everywhere . 
the professor might have everyone else fooled ,  but i know who the real brains of the operation is . 
alright .  .  .  i might need your help . 
you &apos;re not wearing a belt . 
it &apos;s okay .  i understand . 
would you like to see the girl ? 
father ,  are you okay ? 
remember ,  don &apos;t ask her too many questions . 
aww ,  man .  you just need to chill out .  come on ,  there &apos;s this party tonight it &apos;s gonna be fun .  lot &apos;s of alcohol and honeys . 
oh ,  boy !  
bye ,  mrs ,  sutphin . 
0h ,  shit ! 
i saw blood !  and it &apos;s brown !  not red like in horror movies ,  but brown !  ! 
how about mrs .  ackerman ?  we both hate her !   should she be the next victim ? 
ladies and gentlemen ,  the perfect meatloaf ! 
time to get up ,  that &apos;s all .  you &apos;ll be late for work . 
i &apos;m sorry he &apos;s dead ,  but .  .  .  have you signed off yet ? 
he goes to college with me ! 
i got somebody you could run over ,  mother ! 
hi ,  hank . 
yeah !  oohhhh !  get it ! 
let &apos;s say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days . 
did you drive your car to the pta meeting yesterday ,  mrs .  sutphin ? 
 &quot; p &quot;  as in .  .  . 
the police are tracing your call right this minute . 
what exactly does this sick individual say to you ? 
motherfucker !  ! 
and we &apos;re going right to the flea market to get another one !  misty tells me there &apos;s a whole booth of franklin mint stuff .  dottie ,  you lock up .   i &apos;ll take care of poor rosemary ! 
you mean to tell me the day i came over to mrs .  ackerman &apos;s .  .  .  the day you claim you recognized my voice .  .  .  you weren &apos;t drinking ? 
it &apos;s just not your day ,  is it rosemary ? 
mrs .  ackerman ,  when you left me at the flea - market ,  where did you go ? 
did carl padgett buy something you wanted ? 
that was your people magazine with the letters cut out ,  wasn &apos;t it ? 
mrs .  ackerman ,  do you recycle ? 
he is assistant manager of a video shop .  .  . 
i don &apos;t know what it is about today ,  but i feel great ! 
young man ,  this faberge egg is chipped . 
the name may not mean anything to you ,  young lady ,  but say the word and i &apos;ll have your sister for you in forty - eight hours . 
you scared ? 
it &apos;s only a little way ,  mr .  august . 
how &apos;s miss jacqueline ? 
nothing &apos;s happened to her .  it &apos;s just that i can &apos;t understand her not getting in touch with you . 
the tip is ,  anyhow .  i like to work on your hair . 
nothing !  that &apos;s absurd .  i heard you laughing and talking ,  she was asking questions . 
thank you .  it was a lovely dinner . 
yes ,  of course  but the police would say you &apos;d probably had a bad dream . 
good night ,  jacqueline  -  -  good night ,  mary . 
i &apos;ve never loved any one before ,  gregory ,  and i do love you  -  you must know it  -  -  but jacqueline &apos;s my sister  whom i had lost and have found again .  .  .  .    
but i &apos;m not joking . 
but i understand her .  that may be more important . 
you &apos;ll be all right ? 
that &apos;s it .  and this figure  -  - she traced it .  the book i saw at the library had been marked  &quot; perfect &quot;  by the library inspector in march .  mrs .  redi had it out in april .  no one else had read it since . 
such a simple matter .  this figure is the symbol of the palladists . 
i want you to see my room .  i want you to see all of it . 
and you believe that ? 
not i  -  i am alive ,  yet every hope i had is dead ,   death can be good .  death can be happy .  .  if i were really dying i could speak like cyrano  -   &quot; my courage like a white plume &quot;   and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death .  then perhaps you might understand , 
jason ,  my pet 
what are you thinking of ,  bella ?  can i eat dry ? 
oh ,  mr .  jason .  i really shouldn &apos;t be doing this ,  you know .  it &apos;s against the rules .   when did you say you wanted them ? 
following me to find jacqueline ? 
tell me ,  why this sudden desire to publish  to awaken like byron and find yourself famous . 
i know the theory behind the movement .  if one believes in good one believes in evil .  if one believes in god ,  one must believe in the devil .  and an intelligent person can make his own choice  that &apos;s it ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
i think i can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation .  i know too much .  i was jacqueline &apos;s psycho - analyst . 
i was a great dancer .  .  . 
no ,  you draw no secrets from me ,  as you drew them from jacqueline .  you are not one of us yet .  you &apos;re clever ,  louis ,  but i recognize your interest in me for what it is worth .  you are only curious .  you have never loved a woman who had but one arm . 
i didn &apos;t know . 
there &apos;s nothing you can think of  -  -  old letters ,  anything ,  that might give me some hint as to where i might find jacqueline ? 
i &apos;m afraid not . 
yes  yes ,  if she made that much impression on you ,  i &apos;m sure it was jacqueline . 
but she was here ? 
we don &apos;t know ,  mary .  we &apos;ve been unable to get in touch with your sister . 
i &apos;m worry to bother you .  i want to ask you about my sister . 
miss gibson ,  i &apos;m tired of resting . 
is it fifteen minutes yet ? 
ann ? 
we .  .  .  don &apos;t usually let people smoke in the house .  we have a patio if you  -  - 
 .  .  . free - lance .  you know . 
oh ,  uh - huh . 
how long has it been since you &apos;ve seen john ? 
yeah ,  i know .  i mean ,  i &apos;m not saying i know people think you &apos;re a bitch ,  i &apos;m saying i know what you mean .  and i don &apos;t even know that people think you &apos;re a bitch .  do they ? 
so what about kids ? 
as long as it &apos;s not .  .  .  gross ,  you know ?  like some scar or something .  it has to be like mine ,  like something about you . 
does it bother you ? 
now ,  you said never take advice from someone that you don &apos;t know intimately ,  right ? 
yes . 
i don &apos;t .  .  .  why .  .  .  why do you do this ? 
tell me your name . 
you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m thinking . 
i guess not . 
i remember .  you could do that ,  couldn &apos;t you ?  go down on me ? 
if i asked you to ,  would you ?  not on tape ,  i mean ? 
i loved her for how good she made me feel ,  and i hated her for how good she made me feel .  and at that time ,  i tended to express my feelings non -  verbally .  i couldn &apos;t handle anyone having that much control over my emotions . 
who ?  elizabeth ? 
you mean you &apos;re still in contact with her ? 
graham ,  i mean ,  what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her ? 
i don &apos;t find this  &quot; turning the tables &quot;  thing very interesting  -  - 
why are you ashamed ? 
but why can &apos;t you just put it all behind you ?  can &apos;t you just forget it ?  all that stuff you did ? 
yes .  i just got busy . 
then maybe i saw an old message .  there are a lot of them on my desk ,  you know . 
no ,  i &apos;m not .  frankly ,  i &apos;m offended at the accusation . 
goddam right . 
well ,  last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities ,  and now we &apos;re talking about your concern over the garbage problem . 
when did you begin having this feeling ? 
perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched . 
yes ,  it &apos;s this radioactive gas in the ground ,  and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up ,  and  -  -  you &apos;ve never heard of this ? 
what visitor ? 
oh ,  graham .  no ,  i didn &apos;t talk to him about that .  actually ,  that turned out to be pretty interesting .  i expected graham to be this .  .  .  well ,  like john ,  you know ?  i mean ,  he said they had gone to school together ,  so i was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff .  but he turned out to be this .  .  .  this kind of character ,  i mean ,  he &apos;s kind of arty but okay ,  you know ? 
that you are under no obligation to me ? 
i hate my sister . 
i just want to know what he looks like ,  is all . 
ann ,  you always underestimate me . 
well ,  i &apos;ll call him when he does . 
and what ? 
don &apos;t you think she deserves a little more than a card ?  i mean ,  the woman gave birth to you .  it &apos;s her fiftieth birthday  -  - 
fine . 
he just asked me questions . 
i wanted him to see me . 
you couldn &apos;t do it ,  period . 
here it is . 
do you have my work number ? 
i get real busy between two and four . 
bye . 
the extrovert . 
is this how you get off or something ?  taping women talking about their sexual experiences ? 
and you ask questions ,  right ? 
was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward ? 
live ,  or in a photograph or film of some sort ? 
do you like the way i look ? 
i would . 
cynthia ,  i don &apos;t know . 
how about inviting me over to dinner ? 
jesus .  i could almost understand it if he was screwing these people ,  almost .  why doesn &apos;t he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something ? 
no . 
plenty of room for two people . 
i &apos;m sorry .  am i prying again ?

hi ,  john .

you want to help sick people for the rest of your life ?  god forbid i should talk you out of it .

no ,  no ,  no .  it &apos;s cool .  i talked to victoria .  she &apos;s cool .  everyone &apos;s cool . 
you go .  in fact ,  use my clubs .  they &apos;re brand new  -  -  gift from christine &apos;s dad .   it &apos;s on me .  oh ,  say ,  by the way ,  stephanie and me were thinking we &apos;d all go to the hitching post tonight and sit at one of maya &apos;s tables ,  and she &apos;ll bring us some great wines and then we can all  -  - 
later . 
oh ,  boy . 
you should call her .

being with stephanie has opened my eyes .  she &apos;s not uptight or controlling .  she &apos;s just cool .  things are so easy with her .  smells different .  tastes different .  fucks different .  fucks like an animal .  i &apos;m telling you ,  i went deep last night ,  miles .  deep .

nice shot . 
shut up !  shut up !  shut up !  what &apos;s the matter with you ,  man ?  shut up ! 
what is it ? 
i said okay ? 
you ever actually read any of this guy &apos;s books ? 
what ? 
you didn &apos;t get any ,  did you ?   you &apos;re a homo . 
just write another one .  you have lots of ideas ,  right ? 
see ?  right there .  just what you just said .  that &apos;s beautiful .  a thumbprint on a skyscraper .  i couldn &apos;t write that . 
ran .  twisted my ankle too . 
look at this ! 
love you ,  man . 
hey ,  don &apos;t pull away till they see the car . 
so what gems do you have in your collection ? 
i commute to san luis obispo twice a week . 
i had a good time tonight ,  miles .  i really did . 
hope you like it .  feel free to stop reading at any time .  i &apos;ll take no offense . 
heard you got remarried !  congratulations .  didn &apos;t think you had the stomach for another go - round . 
i guess i just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and i just ,  i just  -  - 
hi ,  vicki .   you look beautiful . 
that &apos;s great . 
huh .  that explains all the tannins .  and how long in oak ? 
should we get dessert ? 
oops .  sorry . 
hi ,  guys .  we should probably get going . 
stephanie !  stop ! 
houdini &apos;s sick . 
what &apos;s the matter ? 
 .  .  . tell morgan to play games  -  -  it &apos;s okay to be silly . 
explain noises . 
that roof is over ten feet high . 
do you feel comforted ? 
for the kids protection .  all they were doing was watching tv from five a . m .  i felt like they were getting obsessed like you said .  they should be playing furry ,  furry rabbit or tea party or something right ? 
that &apos;s a game isn &apos;t it ?   anyway .  .  .   there &apos;s been some interesting developments . 
merrill ! 
don &apos;t touch him . 
these are d &apos;s; i need double a &apos;s . 
so the aliens can &apos;t read our minds . 
it says they &apos;re probably very small  -  -  like my height  -  -  because ,  as their brains developed ,  there was no use for physical development .  it says they &apos;re probably vegetarians ,  because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet . 
french toast .  .  .  and mashed potatoes . 
it &apos;s the strangest thing father . 
you can &apos;t describe him at all ?  don &apos;t you think that &apos;s find of odd ? 
i don &apos;t know whether to look for a midget or a  -  - 
okay .   so he was tall ? 
and three weeks . 
there was an accident .  drunk driving .  they weren &apos;t sure . 
is he okay ? 
she &apos;s not in an ambulance father . 
is that him ? 
if we charge them ,  they won &apos;t have a chance .  but we gotta get to the horses . 
all i did was kiss a girl . 
well ,  no ,  not exactly .  see then his friend opened up on me . 
 .  .  . gotta go .  .  . 
i gotta get to my brother .  if they came after me ,  they &apos;ll want him too . 
are you all right ? 
this time you &apos;re really going ?   you know where i &apos;ll be . 
maybe i ought to throw you in jail too .  then you could be with all your friends . 
i want you out of town before the hanging . 
jefferson city ? 
c &apos;mon ,  i &apos;ll buy you a drink . 
cobb ,  i want you to meet emmett .  he &apos;s a friend of mine .   this is sheriff cobb . 
daddy ? 
that &apos;s a lie . 
you mean you ain &apos;t coming with emmett and me ? 
that &apos;s the longest i ever did it .   &apos;bout bust a gut . 
who is he ? 
what are you talking about ? 
i don &apos;t like that word much ,  carter . 
he was murdered . 
rae ,  all we got is each other . 
why him ? 
this is mighty sweet ,  paden .  i think i finally found my place in the world . 
you gotta calm down ,  paden .  everything will be put straight in a few days . 
nifty . 
yeah ,  aside from being a loud - mouthed ,  lying cheat ,  he &apos;s just the man i would have picked . 
from what i &apos;ve seen ,  paden doesn &apos;t care much about money . 
a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions  -  -  also bogus ? 
i can &apos;t imagine how you ever let a man like that go .   i owe viktor everything . 
of course she is .   no other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her . 
 -  -  do you know what these are ,  elaine ? 
they &apos;re yours .   but how are you going to finish it ?   without a star there &apos;s no movie . 
viktor .  .  .  i want to thank you for convincing simone to sign with the studio . 
viktor ,  we simply have to talk about  &quot; eternity .  .  .  &quot; 
whatever .   i still haven &apos;t received simone &apos;s script notes . 
she was in the theater ?   when ?  where ? 
experience ,  viktor .   i &apos;ve seen this a hundred times  -  -  young stars destroying the very people who discovered them .   i &apos;m worried about you ,  that &apos;s all .   this woman  -  -  she controls your destiny . 
maybe you &apos;re right .   twelve years after your daughter &apos;s born you decide to become a father . 
she was there .   she didn &apos;t by any chance happen to mention me ? 
well ,  yes .   from a studio point of view ,  it would be better if simone stayed single .   anyhow ,  i thought she came across great tonight .   intelligent ,  well informed ,  a natural .   and touching .  she was spectacular . 
 -  -  she &apos;s a figment of my own imagination .   i ,  viktor taransky ,  have perpetrated the greatest hoax ,  the greatest sleight - of - hand ,  sleight - of - mouth ,  sleight - of -  sleight in entertainment history !  and still no one appreciates me ,  recognizes what i &apos;ve done  -  -  even you . 
thank you !   i don &apos;t know how you did it but thank you . 
why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast ? 
mom ,  do you miss dad ? 
you understand you &apos;ll have to come back to my place to keep them off the ,  er .  .  .    .  .  .  scent . 
you &apos;re with me to be close to her ? 
no ,  i &apos;m okay . 
the film .   the chemistry .   no reflections on nicola but simone and i  -  -  we were just so right together . 
hal ,  what are you doing ? 
i did it ,  mr .  taransky .   i licked skin .   i licked hair .   i licked every part of her . 
not like this  -  - 
 -  -  flesh is weak . 
i &apos;m sorry mom canned you . 
can &apos;t you stop that ? 
hey ,  lainey .   how &apos;s your love life ? 
she thinks you &apos;re with simone . 
i know but mom doesn &apos;t .   maybe if it came from simone ,  if simone spoke to mom  -  -  she could straighten things out .   dinner ,  maybe . 
about you and mom ? 
 -  -  no !   i can &apos;t go along with this horseshit !   just tell them they can fry me ! 
so they &apos;re probably here .   you might be able to sell this  &apos;disappearing act &apos; to the rest of the world ,  but i &apos;m not buying it .  what &apos;s really behind this simone woman ?   the public has a right to know .   why is she staying out of sight ?   and why the hell is she with you ?   i don &apos;t want you to take this the wrong way ,  viktor ,  but you &apos;re not exactly cecil b .  demille  -  -  more run - of - the - mill . 
she sounds like a prisoner ,  taransky .   are you holding her hostage ?   are you some kind of svengali ? 
the cops ?   the cops read my column to know who to bust .   we &apos;re the only watchdog the public has .   none of this is going away .   we &apos;ll be here tomorrow and the day after that .   until you slip up .   and you will .   you are looking at your shadow .   because all these elaborate precautions with simone  -  -  every instinct in my body tells me ,  it &apos;s not natural . 
nice boat ,  taransky . 
 -  -  i &apos;ve looked at every piece of publicity she &apos;s ever done ,  the video in the supermarket ,  there &apos;s no evidence she &apos;s ever left the studio .   oh ,  and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail .   but i have  &quot; obtained &quot;  a copy of your bank accounts .   i know you have power of attorney but so far you haven &apos;t transferred one single solitary cent to her . 
alright ,  sayer ,  you &apos;ve got a deal . 
that doesn &apos;t prove a thing  -  -  wait until i get a court order for a blood test . 
a lot &apos;s happened since we last saw each other . 
thank you .   it &apos;s not important . 
i &apos;ll do anything to please you ,  mr .  taransky . 
simone ,  are you there ? 
maybe he can . 
mr .  taransky ,  we both know i was nothing without you .   i was computer code  -  -  ones and zeros . 
you want to ask me a question ? 
you said the  &quot; s &quot;  word . 
think about what you want from our time together .  what our goal should be ? 
i didn &apos;t know you were funny . 
your father ever tell you bedtime stories ? 
once upon a time there was a prince ,  who was being driven around .  .  .  he drove around for a long ,  long time .  .  .  driving and driving .  .  .  it was a long trip .  .  .  he fell asleep .  .  .   when he woke up ,  they were still driving .  .  .  the long drive went on -  - 
i don &apos;t know how the story ends .  i hope it &apos;s a happy ending . 
how often do you see them ? 
dr .  crowe ? 
what if they don &apos;t want help ?  what if they &apos;re just angry and they want to hurt somebody ? 
communicate ? 
they ? 
that &apos;s not correct .  where &apos;d you hear that ? 
i work at an insurance place and at penny &apos;s ,  so cole can go to that good school . 
 &apos;course ,  some folks say  &apos;ol jethro shouldn &apos;t have been buried up here .  .  .  with the rest of the macdonalds . 
maybe you don &apos;t want to remember . 
just talked to orwell down at the garage .  says getting a new alternator for your bus is no problem . 
could take a little while ,  though . 
see ? 
okay ,  farm boy .  joke &apos;s over .  you &apos;ve been playin &apos; me from jump street .  where &apos;s my nikes ? 
hey !  don &apos;t use all the hot water ! 
let me guess .  we &apos;re going on a  &quot; long trip &quot;  . 
no .  this is something spiritual .  an ambition . 
suzie ?  ?  ? 
how would you know ?  you &apos;re looking at my tits .   jesus ,  carl .  your job is to keep us on the road ! 
carl ,  what are you doing ? 
thought your boy and his band were only staying the night . 
okay .  my main man .  marvin gaye . 
damn !  these are one hundred dollar nikes ! 
you &apos;re out of your mind ,  man . 
are you crazy ? 
we &apos;ve got to call someone  -  -  get the sheriff -  - 
i &apos;ll be gone again tomorrow . 
you got it wrong ,  boy .  i &apos;m not the monster you think . 
old slave superstition .  you sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops ,  you get yourself a good harvest .  .  .  so they say . 
it &apos;s time to make amends . 
it &apos;s a farm ,  keith .  you &apos;re not supposed to shoot the rooster . 
you seen mac ?  his bed hasn &apos;t been slept in . 
hallelujah !   .  .  . civilization .  .  .  here i come ! 
how does it feel ,  keith ? 
time for a little .  .  .   &quot; feedback &quot;  guys .  that guy from hectic records  -  - 
my father and i don &apos;t exactly see eye to eye . 
how &apos;d you get that ?  playing with your pitchfork ? 
you &apos;re .  .  .  limping . 
get out of here . 
like your guitar break . 
carl . 
what ? 
pretty ,  ain &apos;t they ? 
wait !  dammit ,  bill ,  if that girl &apos;s still out there ,  how will you find her ?  how ,  unless you bring grant in alive ?  your best chance of doing that is with me .  i can talk to him  -  - 
what are you doing ?  ! 
what ? 
surprised you &apos;re able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long . 
looks like a chipmunk . 
my sister megan ,  she &apos;s a big fat cow .  was then ,  even more so now .  i &apos;d be thinking ,  what &apos;d you see in her ain &apos;t in me ? 
guess it &apos;s hard to explain how amazin &apos; a human brain is to someone who that &apos;s all they know . 
meat . 
that &apos;s not true  -  -  where are you -  -  ? 
who &apos;s that ? 
he took him over .  his body .  his  -  -  his brain ,  everything what he knew .  he &apos;s only been dumb stuff before amoeba -  - things ,  and rhino -  - things .  he liked being human .  didn &apos;t want to change . 
ain &apos;t no mystery to it .  she &apos;s raised in them shanties off st .  luc .  dirt -  - poor . 
look ,  you make this little run for me ,  i &apos;ll buy you a new rig . 
a truck ?  you &apos;re doing this for a truck ?  that &apos;s insanity . 
no .  i want to know what you think about besides ditching smokey ? 
you have a great profile . 
you know ,  you &apos;re not a bad driver . 
that &apos;s a texas cop .  what the hell &apos;s he doing in arkansas ? 
well ? 
the bus &apos;ll pick you up over there .   uh .  .  .  you got enough bread for a ticket ? 
jesus !  !  ! 
yeah . 
where did you learn how to drive like this ? 
i guess if there &apos;s one lesson i &apos;ve learned ,  it &apos;s that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target .   i forgot your question ? 
i been thinking .  maybe i should drop you in montgomery .  i mean ,  the way things are going ,  it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to atlanta . 
what are you thinking ? 
what do you want me to do ,  hot pants ?  beg ? 
but you &apos;ll do it ? 
no what ? 
also boring . 
now ,  if i say go to channel three ,  it really means go to six . 
you can &apos;t swear on these . 
what &apos;s a texas smokey doing in arkansas ,  man ? 
bandit ? 
i &apos;m all ears ,  good buddy . 
it shouldn &apos;t last .  gives me time to take a go - go juice break . 
talk to me . 
it ain &apos;t ever been done before ,  hot shit . 
shut up ,  fred . 
 -  -  breaker ,  breaker .  this is banana peel . 
yes ,  but no  -  -  we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall ,  twenty - four hours a day . 
spotter on the lake confirmed israel .  penthouse level .  there was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes .  he wasn &apos;t involved .  he &apos;s also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls . 
this man wearing the jacket identified himself as an federal agent ? 
no .  sorry comes later ,  when you &apos;re in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis .  sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection ,  sorry  -  - 
so i guess you &apos;re not going . 
i know his location ,  we &apos;ve got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape - vined and the rest of the world gets hipped . 
what &apos;d you say ? 
i could have it sent out .  .  . 
they &apos;re gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal &apos;s off ! 
buddy ,  they revoked the deal ,  they pulled it .  .  . 
it &apos;s the last place they &apos;d look . 
my debrief  -  - 
you realize that sparraza has had thirty - six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953 ?  elective plastic surgery ,  every single one  -  - 
that &apos;s not a problem .  are we goin &apos; outta pocket ourselves ? 
 -  -  no ,  no ,  not when y &apos;can see the shore .  i hear ya . 
what &apos;s wrong ? 
bulllllshit .  .  . 
what i &apos;m saying is :  don &apos;t trust anyone .   find yourself a weapon of some sort . 
you &apos;ll end up like me . 
i want to hear your version . 
that &apos;s fantastic . 
you murdered her ! 
she &apos;ll come back . 
it started about three months ago .  right after the government sold the expedition .   we were ready to go home . 
is it being deliberately cruel ,  you mean ?   i don &apos;t think so . 
if god is beyond our comprehension ,  and she  -  -    -  -  is here for reasons that can &apos;t be understood ,  isn &apos;t god here ? 
what happened ? 
when did this happen ? 
don &apos;t . 
you still don &apos;t believe in god ? 
i would have these  -  -  i don &apos;t know how to describe them  -  -  visions ,  when i was younger .   maybe not visions ,  but like these waking dream states .   time would just collapse ,  i would be inside time .   i would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped .   freaky stuff . 
seven ,  eight .   so one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space ,  and she asks me what i &apos;m doing ,  and i start trying to explain to her ,  about this state that i can put myself in ,  and this look comes over her face . 
thinking what you were doing and saying ,  just being consumed by thinking of you .   i loved it so much ,  that feeling . 
do you have any idea how much i like fucking you ? 
i like that too . 
what does snow think you should do ? 
do i really feel like .  .  .  i am .  .  .  ? 
who have you been talking to ? 
was she right ? 
i have these strange thoughts ,  i don &apos;t know where they come from .   i can &apos;t explain it . 
i &apos;m not rheya .   you &apos;ve always known that . 
don &apos;t do this .   i am literally begging you not to do this .   chris . 
it wouldn &apos;t have made any difference . 
chris  -  - 
i .  .  .  i am rheya .   but i am not the woman you loved ten years ago . 
where did you go before ? 
last night .   you were talking to someone in the corridor . 
gibarian was under enormous  -  - 
skiddy and kit ?   i haven &apos;t seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape . 
and so what &apos;s with steinhart ?   is it serious ? 
i &apos;ve never seen anyone killed before . 
right .   that &apos;s true . 
you live in manhattan ? 
would you pick one out ,  please ? 
i guess i &apos;m supposed to do it in the morning .   identify him . 
claire ? 
you know why they &apos;re like that .  .  .  ?  he was myopic .  .  .  going blind . 
so ,  this could be your last night ,  huh ? 
want to go out for a drink ?   i mean ,  we &apos;re both sitting here ,  and joey venza &apos;s in jail .  .  . 
and die laughing ,  because you &apos;re walking so stupid ! 
what about neil ? 
good night ,  mike . 
you told me i &apos;m safe ?   i &apos;m going for a walk in the park . 
yeah . 
i like your coat . 
say goodbye ,  mike . 
think i should put the skateboard in bed with him ? 
ellie ,  you know i think it &apos;s about time we got outa this place ,  get us a house of our own .   we can afford it now . 
tomorrow ,  i start looking for our house .  .  .  you love me ? 
so how &apos;d it go ? 
for how long ? 
oh i can see you &apos;ve had a bad day .  we &apos;ll see the house another time ,  okay ? 
what did she say the down payment was ? 
what &apos;s wrong with your paisley tie ? 
excuse me !   you went to a party with her ? 
what ? 
jesus ,  mike ,  somebody &apos;s been feeding you a line of crap . 
i &apos;m going to visit my sister for a few days .   i &apos;d like you to get your stuff out . 
was it venza ?   did you get him ? 
why not patrol ?   they &apos;d do just as good a job . 
you in this with me ? 
why should she come in ? 
bullshit !   prove it . 
get that gun away from his head ,  or i &apos;ll keep her from coming in !   put the gun on me ,  he can &apos;t hurt you !  he &apos;s tied up !   put him under the table ! 
under the table . 
except the goddamn skateboards ,  which are everywhere !   i &apos;d like to kill the guy who invented those things . 
what  &quot; plans ?  &quot;   you and mom got  &quot; plans ?  &quot; 
and flash isn &apos;t ? 
here you go ,  pete . 
ah ,  ya know .   neighborhood &apos;s not what it used to be .   kid no more &apos;n five swiped a candy bar the other day . 
ya set for ,  uh ,  ya know -  -  money ? 
cause if you get in a bind -  - 
lizzy ! 
hey ,  guys .   check it out -  -  i saw this dud on the tube last night .  he is incredibly cool . 
you maniac .   you &apos;ll blow your scholarship . 
you get mugged or something ? 
would you cool it already ? 
eh .   week from tomorrow . 
is that bug juice ,  or are you just glad to see me ? 
i see .   so ,  amazing spider - man -  -  i &apos;ll assume that &apos;s not your given name -  - 
can i get you a snack -  -  a housefly ,  maybe ? 
all right ,  amazing .   are you quite finished ? 
i hate the platonic idea of you . 
god ,  flash can be such a jerk . 
some prep school thing . 
eat alone ,  gotta read .  social defense tactic 17  peter ,  that jacket is foul .   lose your glasses ? 
you &apos;d feel what ? 
i &apos;m sorry about being a jerk this afternoon . 
this may be the end of a beautiful friendship ,  you know . 
no such thing as coincidence .    &quot; god does not play dice with the universe .  &quot; 
aunt may ,  you &apos;re trespassing . 
absolutely no class . 
peter ,  you &apos;re bleeding . 
what you &apos;ve done is make the entire physics department look foolish .  you compare yourself to einstein; your colleagues compare you to bozo the clown . 
a bit melodramatic but if you could prove it that would tie in your unified field theory ,  the big bang ,  kaluza - klein -  - 
otto ,  we are mere mortals .  you must never forget your own limits -  - 
pretty lame for such a smart kid . 
where &apos;d you get the clown suit ? 
how did he ever find out about that ammunition train ? 
jawohl . 
where &apos;s hoffy ?  why don &apos;t we get any news about dunbar ? 
i had to be the ham !  i had to shoot off my mouth ! 
w - w - will that do or do you want some m - m - m  -  -  ? 
why not ?  just one of the boys .  sharing our bunks .  eating our chow .  right in amongst the ones that beat me up .  except that he beat hardest . 
that &apos;s not the point ,  cookie .  the point is what do you do with him ?  you tip your mitt and the jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else ,  like stalag sixteen or fifteen .  or you kill him off and the krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks .  every one of us .  so what do you do ? 
private property ,  bub . 
what &apos;s your beef ,  boys ?  so i &apos;m trading .  everybody here is trading .  only maybe i trade a little sharper .  so that makes me a collaborator . 
i suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces ? 
what are you looking at him for ?   any objections ,  sefton ? 
break it off ! 
cut out the guff ,  schulz .  we &apos;re on to you .  you know everything that &apos;s happening in this barrack .  who &apos;s tipping you off ? 
come on ,  schulz !  spill it !  how did you get the information ?  about manfredi and johnson ?  about the stove and the tunnel ?  who &apos;s giving it to you ?  which one of us is it ? 
that &apos;s the general idea .   only it &apos;s not so general as far as i &apos;m concerned . 
you &apos;d better get that blue blood circulating ,  because we &apos;re busting out of this stink - hole in exactly  -  -    -  -  one minute and twenty seconds . 
i &apos;m okay here .  why bother ? 
i didn &apos;t do it .  i was in the frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up . 
very well .  if you insist on details .  i have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb .  good day ,  sir .   you will forgive me for receiving you like this ? 
hey ,  schulz !  i got a deal for you .  suppose you help us escape .  we &apos;ll go home and have everything ready for you in madison square garden .  for the world championship !  schulz ,  the beast of bavaria versus halitosis jones ! 
why don &apos;t we accept ,  animal ?  the worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades . 
 &apos;we will remove the iron stove  -  -  the one that was camouflaging the trap door .  &apos;
look at me !  i &apos;m your baby !   get a load of that blonde one !  built like a brick kremlin ! 
let me go !  let me go ! 
no you don &apos;t !  you don &apos;t want any broads with boots on ! 
animal !  when the war &apos;s over ,  remember i told you i &apos;d fix you up with betty grable ! 
easy ,  animal !  easy ! 
ain &apos;t that too bad !  tomorrow he &apos;ll have to suck a raw egg ! 
you &apos;ll fix me up ! 
you did ? 
hey !  this is with a typewriter !  it &apos;s from a finance company ! 
you don &apos;t want to cry over a dame that doesn &apos;t even know you &apos;re alive !  snap out of it ! 
may i have this dance ,  miss ? 
look  -  -  if you don &apos;t like the way i &apos;m handling this job  -  - 
it &apos;s not schulz .  it &apos;s that stoolie .  whoever he is ,  he &apos;s sure batting a thousand . 
los ,  los .  dummkopf ! 
what radio ? 
stay out of it ,  sefton . 
if i were you ,  sefton ,  i &apos;d eat that egg some place else .  like for instance under the barrack . 
if you can &apos;t get the bbc ,  how about getting guy lombardo ? 
what &apos;s it add up to you ,  sefton ? 
stop that ,  will you !   those idiots !  so they sprang dunbar !  so what good is it ?  he &apos;s still in the compound ,  isn &apos;t he ?  how long can he last ?  where can they hide him ? 
will you get this guy out of my hair so i can go ? 
good morning ,  sefton . 
three hundred cigarettes !  what is it you want from me ? 
what guy ? 
i do not want those cigarettes . 
what &apos;s the matter with you ?  you want to be killed ? 
did i interrupt something ,  gentlemen ? 
have a nice time over there ? 
toh - pak - cha=8a 
tomorrow i want to make a tri - elliptical jump .  that &apos;s where you jump out over northern china and make three complete orbits before you start re - entry . 
population ? 
data ,  are you all right ? 
we &apos;re within visual range of the energy distortion ,  captain . 
these are my children .  .  . my children . 
excuse me ,  gentlemen ,  if you &apos;ll take your seats . 
so you &apos;re telling me this is the 24th - century ,  and i &apos;m dead ? 
captain of the enterprise ,  huh ? 
i &apos;ll find a way to contact the enterprise .  you &apos;re going to be all right . 
a remarkable piece of equipment ,  but a little inelegant ,  wouldn &apos;t you say ?   have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more .  .  . normal ? 
sir ? 
counselor .  what can i do for you ? 
captain ,  im sorry .   i know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother . 
these blast patterns are consistent with type iii disruptors . 
tractor beam ,  aye ! 
transwarp at your command ,  sir ! 
what &apos;s going on ?  when do we get paid off .  .  .  ? 
unit two ,  this is one .  the kobayashi maru has set sail for the promised land .  acknowledge . 
excelsior closing to 4 , 000 meters ,  sir . 
you did great ,  bones .  .  .  just great . 
nothing on my scanner ,  sir . 
sir .  .  .  something &apos;s jamming our transmission .  an energy surge . 
david ,  i don &apos;t understand .  .  . 
negative ,  on surface .  .  .  a manufactured object . 
approximately two meters long .  .  .  cylindrical in form .  .  . 
well .  there &apos;s your life form reading .  these were microbes on the tube &apos;s surface .  we shot them here from enterprise .   they were fruitful ,  and multiplied . 
what is it ? 
how can you be logical at a time like this ?  !  we have to get thee hell off this planet ! 
did your collaborator know ? 
days .  .  .  maybe hours .  .  .  protomatter has made the situation unpredictable .   i &apos;m sorry . 
i &apos;m sure starfleet would approve ,  sir . 
i &apos;m all right  -  -  stand by to return fire !  mr .  scott ,  transfer power to the phaser banks  -  - 
admiral ,  this is lieutenant saavik . 
or less .  what you describe is called fal tor pan  -  the refusion .  it is very dangerous .  the elders may not choose to attempt it . 
why would you do this .  .  .  ? 
on course ,  admiral .  estimating spacedock in two point one hours . 
estimating genesis 2 . 9 hours ,  present speed . 
i say again :  grissom ,  this is enterprise .  admiral kirk calling captain esteban or lieutenant saavik .  come in ! 
do not lecture me about treaty violations .  the federation ,  in creating an ultimate weapon ,  has become a gang of intergalactic criminals .  it is not i who will surrender ,  it is you .   on the planet below ,  i have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon .  if you do not surrender immediately ,  i will execute them ,  one at a time ,  as enemies of galactic peace . 
there are two more prisoners ,  admiral .  do you want them killed too ?   surrender your vessel ! 
 .  .  .  he spoke of your friendship . 
please wait !  .  .  .  surely he would have found a way !  if there was so much at stake  -  -  spock would have found a way ! 
we are going to this  &quot; planet .  &quot;  even as our emissaries negotiate for  &quot; peace &quot;  with the federation ,  we will act< / u> for the preservation of our race !  we will seize the secret of this weapon .  the secret of ultimate power ! 
1 , 000 kellicams ,  closing ! 
sir ,  may i  -  - 
a twenty year space veteran ,  yet you ask for the worst duty station in town .  i mean ,  look at this place :  the hind end of space . 
slide them down your nose .  now look at me over the top .  and you read printed matter through the bottom . 
don &apos;t mince words ,  bones; tell me what you really think . 
khan could be down there ! 
this is completely improper ,  commander chekov .  i have no intention of allowing reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials . 
you did this  -  -  in a day ?  ! 
it is a far far better thing i do than i have ever done before .  .  .  a far better resting place i go to than i have ever known .  .  . 
will you please be quiet !  we must have order here .   this has to be some sort of mistake . 
but the child  -  - 
captain kirk was your host !  you repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him . 
khan ,  listen to me !  captain kirk was only doing his duty !  you  -  - 
i would think so ,  sir .  he &apos;s on the fleet general staff . 
where &apos;s dr .  marcus  -  - 
i suppose i was .   i poured a drink .  would you like it ? 
it was just words . 
don &apos;t you believe it . 
no ! 
no sir !  we have genesis  -  -  whatever you want  -  - 
you still remember ,  admiral .  i cannot help but be touched .  of course ,  i remember you . 
give me some time to recall the data on our computers  -  - 
you are in a position to demand nothing ,  sir .  i ,  on the other hand ,  am in a position to grant nothing .  what you see is all that remains of the ship &apos;s company and the crew of the botany bay< / u> ,  marooned here fifteen years ago by captain james t .  kirk . 
we &apos;ll be going to warp speed  -  - 
i &apos;ll need ten minutes ,  sir ,   &apos;til the radiation dissipates . 
enterprise to reliant .  come in ,  reliant . 
saavik ,  for god &apos;s sake ,  tell her we &apos;re all right . 
mr .  scott ,  you old space dog .  you &apos;re well ? 
the energizer &apos;s bypassed like a christmas tree  -  -  so don &apos;t give me too many bumps . 
kirk to enterprise .  damage report ,  spock ? 
i believe you &apos;ll find everything shipshape ,  admiral . 
is the word given ? 
i assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating i plan to give your cadets . 
twelve hours and forty - three minutes ,  present speed . 
their coil emissions are normal .  .  .  wait :  their shields are going up .  they &apos;re locking phasers  -  -   ! 
they knew just where to hit us . 
admiral ,  you can &apos;t give him genesis .  .  . 
the prefix code ? 
all right ,  join the party .  mr .  spock ,  the ship is yours . 
establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you &apos;ve talked with mr .  scott . 
that &apos;s it ? 
estimating nebula penetration in two minutes .  reliant is closing . 
and why not ? 
begging the admiral &apos;s pardon :  general order 15 :   &apos;no  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort .  &apos;
what< / u> ? 
that was close  -  - 
mr .  saavik ,  all stop . 
time from my mark .  .  . 
aye ,  sir .  on course to ceti alpha .  all is well . 
reliant in our section this quadrant ,  sir ,  and slowing  -  - 
approaching regula and space lab regula i . 
prepare for warp speed . 
he &apos;s very human . 
the question is irrelevant . 
to earth .  to offer testimony . 
how &apos;re you doing ? 
you &apos;re really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket ? 
sure ,  slingshot around the sun .  if you pick up enough speed you &apos;re in time warp .  if you don &apos;t ,  you fry .  . 
it doesn &apos;t look all that different . 
oh ,  joy . 
jim ,  you &apos;ve got to let me go in there !  don &apos;t leave him in the hands of twentieth century medicine . 
umm .  well ,  just wanted to say  -  -  nice to have your katra back in your head ,  not mine .   i mean ,  i may have carried your soul ,  but i sure couldn &apos;t fill your shoes . 
what &apos;s causing that !  ? 
i do not know your name . 
we are in an enemy wessel ,  sir .  i didn &apos;t wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral . 
they are mature humpbacks ,  weighing 45 , 000 pounds each .  they wandered into san francisco bay as calves and were brought here .  we call them george and gracie . 
well ,  for one thing ,  we simply don &apos;t have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day ! 
they &apos;re gonna hafta take their chances . 
don &apos;t tell me :  you &apos;re from outer space . 
so .  there we are . 
it &apos;s true .  .  .  what you said .  .  . 
steady ,  now .  we need your help . 
is there any other planet where this species exists ? 
i think we &apos;ll find what we &apos;re looking for at the cetacean institute in sausalito .  two humpbacks called george and gracie . 
admiral ,  may i ask you a question ? 
spock .  .  . 
you don &apos;t have to lie .  .  .  you could exaggerate . 
mr .  sulu ,  take the con .  i &apos;m taking our guest down to see her whales .   mr .  spock :  have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re - entry program ? 
can we make breakaway speed !  ? 
guidance is functional .  onboard computer will interface with federation memory bank .  .  . 
aye ,  sir .  descending . 
what is it ? 
admiral ,  i am receiving whale songs . 
admiral ,  i have a signal closing on the whales .  bearing 328 degrees . 
estimate range ,  ship to whales ! 
mr .  scott ,  how soon can we get underway ? 
whales ,  scotty .  45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece . 
ironic .  when man was killing these creatures ,  he was destroying his own future .  .  . 
genesis was perfectly named :  the creation of life not death .  it was the klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets . 
your vessel did destroy u . s . s .  grissom .  your men did kill kirk &apos;s son .  do you deny these events ? 
i notice you &apos;re still working with polymers . 
hello ?  computer .  .  .  ? 
as i recall ,  i opposed your enlistment in starfleet .  .  .  it is possible that judgment was incorrect .   your associates are people of good character . 
deceive us ? 
right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin .  .  .  we can hide for days .  .  . 
do you really think your mighty federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people ? 
there is no need for concern .  i am operating within normal parameters now . 
really . 
because you &apos;re it .  and if you tag me .  .  .  then i &apos;m it . 
why not .  .  .  ? 
captain ,  i wasn &apos;t expecting you . 
in stasis .  la forge is completing the diagnostic . 
the countdown control has been transferred to the collector .  .  . i can &apos;t override .  .  . 
moving them is one thing .  killing them all .  .  . 
will that stop the tear ? 
i don &apos;t think they believe us . 
we &apos;re still thirty - six minutes from transmission range ,  sir . 
they need us to mediate some territorial dispute .  .  . 
admiral dougherty wants to know why we haven &apos;t left yet .  .  . 
prepare the ship for departure at oh - seven - hundred hours . 
the council has ordered a halt to the ba &apos;ku relocation while they conduct a top - level review . 
do you know gilbert and sullivan ? 
doctor crusher asked to talk to you when you returned .  .  . 
counselor ? 
go where ?  hello ?  is anyone going to tell me what we &apos;re doing here ? 
it &apos;s cochrane . 
no .  i will not betray my friends . 
i &apos;ve deactivated the sensory inputs .  that flesh on your body is just meat ,  now . 
no .  .  .  no ,  it &apos;s so .  .  .  empty .  .  .  please .  .  .  give it back .  .  .  i need it .  .  . 
the borg ship has modified its shields ,  captain .  our phasers will no longer be effective . 
it has entered earth orbit .   correction  -  -  it is not in orbit .  it is heading directly toward the surface . 
i have helm control . 
that is a contradiction .  the borg act as a collective consciousness .  there are no individuals . 
what did you do to the batteries ? 
i &apos;m picking up faint life signs twenty meters below . 
passing one - half light speed .  the starboard nacelle &apos;s running a little hot .  .  . 
the inertial dampers are having trouble compensating .  .  .  i don &apos;t think cochrane built this thing for comfort . 
what do you want ? 
captain ,  i &apos;ve found the borg sphere .  it &apos;s on the far side of the planet .  .  . firing at the surface . 
incoming transmission from starfleet command .  admiral hayes . 
report . 
casualties are light ,  captain .  minor buckling on the port nacelle .  nothing serious . 
a ship - wide decompression has been initiated ! 
to control the enterprise ,  they &apos;ll have to gain access to one of two locations .  main engineering .  .  .  or the bridge . 
what are they doing ? 
emergency override ! 
i have to admit there was a moment there when  -  - 
spock ,  that was actually funny . 
calm yourself ,  doctor ,  the operation is almost complete .  .  . 
sweet jesus .  .  .  !  he &apos;s lost a lot of whatever this stuff is .  .  . 
no ! 
that was the general idea i intended to convey . 
are we playing multiple choice ? 
what kind of creature is this ?  last night you two were spooning  - 
jim ,  leave me  -  i &apos;m finished .  .  . 
captain ,  when we get to camp khitomer ,  how will we defend ourselves ?  i mean ,  if this new bird of prey can fire while she is invisible .  .  .  ? 
retire . 
they &apos;ll respect him now .  .  . 
are those your words ? 
you deny that your men beamed aboard kronos one and shot the chancellor ? 
where is mr .  sulu ? 
just the size of my head  - 
course heading ,  captain ? 
mr .  spock ,  rura penthe &apos;s deep in klingon territory .  if we &apos;re discovered .  .  . 
you must have cursed yourself ,  for having programmed our data banks ,  lieutenant .  only they revealed something wrong aboard enterprise . 
aye ,  sir . 
we &apos;re almost at the rendezvous  -  i thought you &apos;d want to know .  .  . 
i always wanted to try that . 
uhura ,  hailing frequencies .  right standard rudder ,  bring us alongside .  .  . 
captain ,  our shields  -  -   ! 
who is  &quot; us ?  &quot; 
surely not . 
according to my information ,  today . 
lieutenant ,  i am pleased to see you .   the lieutenant is the first vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class as the academy . 
never been this close . 
i believe the captain feels that starfleet &apos;s mission has always been one of peace  - 
spock ,  i &apos;m really tired .  .  . 
where ? 
are you dining on worms ? 
you couldn &apos;t have known she was listening the night i dictated that entry into my log .  you were proud of her achievements as a vulcan . 
what &apos;s she waiting for ? 
the only way to find out if a man &apos;s trustworthy .  .  . 
captain  -  - 
but we can &apos;t allow them to be taken back to kronos as prisoners . 
any reply from starfleet to our dispatch ,  lieutenant . 
very well .  for twenty - four hours we &apos;ll agree that this conversation did not take place . 
suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage ? 
if you are logical . 
a computer canna lie ,  sir . 
you can check the torpedoes visually ,  if you like  - 
can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you ? 
jean luc ,  whatever you were .  .  .  right now you &apos;re the man you &apos;ve made yourself .  he &apos;s someone else . 
you can &apos; t imagine them ,  jean luc .  they &apos;re kids !  all with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant . 
they &apos;re running me ragged .  nothing but question day and night .  .  .  i love it !  come to dinner and 1 &apos;1 tell you all about it .  there &apos;s a bajoran band at the officer &apos;s mess . 
and you were particularly aware of this feeling because commander riker will be leaving to assume command of the titan ? 
and this makes you  &quot; sad &quot;  ? 
that is because you have a familiarity with them .  you can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge . 
if i were .  .  .  i believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior .  i would  &quot; miss you .  &quot; 
the final signature is approx -  imately 300 meters up that incline . 
data to captain picard .  geordi and i have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access .  and ,  i believe ,  we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage . 
yes ,  sir . 
alacrity would be appreciated ,  commander . 
he may have already rejected my humanity ,  but you also have a twin
why am i looking at me ? 
well ,  he seems to have the same internal mechanics as data but not as much positronic develop -  ment .   the neural pathways aren &apos;t nearly as sophisticated .  id say he &apos;s a prototype .  something dr .  soong created before data  . 
what is our approximate distance ? 
it &apos;s you . 
no . 
and you needn &apos;t worry .  i &apos;ll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know . 
captain  -  -  i might have a way to find them . 
imzadi .  this is so good . 
cannon fodder . 
i thought thalaron radiation was theoretical . 
prepare for a site - to - site transport . 
sir ,  we &apos;re being hailed . 
diverting to the kolarin system takes us awfully close to the romulan neutral zone . 
oh boy .  destroy humanity and the federation is crippled . 
strength in numbers ? 
counselor troi ,  report to the bridge . 
serving with you has been an honor . 
i am ,  commander riker .  .  .   may i touch your hair ? 
on the world i come from there &apos;s no light .  no sun .  beauty isn &apos;t important .  i see now there &apos;s a world elsewhere . 
for thousands of years the romulan senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister - planet .  .  .  but the time has come for us to live as equals . 
were we always explorers ? 
and i &apos;m not quite human .  so what am i ?  what do you see ?   do you see a life you might have led ?  lost youth never to be recaptured ? 
i see an old man ,  set in his ways ,  afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a starfleet regulation to tell him what to do .  i see the man i will never be . 
it amazes me how little you know yourself . 
i know .  .  .  you &apos;ll all gladly die to save your home world . 
the man who is jean luc picard and shinzon of remus won &apos;t exterminate the population of an entire planet !  he is better than that ! 
i don &apos;t know . 
i hope you &apos;re still alive ,  jean luc . 
our greater goal is more important ,  brother . 
minimal damage to the scimitar . 
don &apos;t forget our mission ,  shinzon .  we should act .  now .  time is running out . 
no  -  -  this is wasting time . 
let her pursue  -  -  drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop . 
what is it ?  !  !  focus on your job !  ! 
and bringing the enterprise here ?  !  what possible purpose could that serve ? 
the enterprise is immaterial !  they won &apos;t make it back to federation space . 
commander suran ,  the games are over .  in two days the federation will be crippled beyond repair .  does that satisfy you ? 
food .  eat .  i prepare food .  i work as a cook .  that &apos;s how i make money . 
what was your last stop ? 
we &apos;re going .  .  .  damn !   we &apos;ll tell the press that there was an accident .  chemical warfare spill .  that cover cannot be violated in any way .  understand me ,  shermin ? 
houston found it in the extraterrestrial &apos;s suit . 
it &apos;s real ,  george . 
george ,  we &apos;ve just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial . 
i don &apos;t care where you &apos;re from you just can &apos;t disappear into thin air . 
no deal . 
i won &apos;t let anyone hurt you . 
mi - chi - gan driver li - see - ens .  .  .  jennyhaydn .  .  .  money ? 
what ? 
i am husband ? 
no ,  no .  .  .  don &apos;t say that .  bad word . 
i want to try it . 
when do you have to be here ? 
sun .  .  .  day .  no sun .  .  .  night .  you understand ? 
the closest i was able to get you was lathrop wells .  .  . 
the driver will .  .  . 
don &apos;t be afraid .  do what i told you and you &apos;ll be okay . 
the police shouldn &apos;t have started shooting .  but you can hardly blame them .  you surprised them .  they didn &apos;t know you were up there .  when they saw you ,  they thought you were here to hurt us . 
i like this music . 
the machine gave me two .  should i put one back ? 
no one &apos;s traveling in this weather . 
it &apos;ll tell you pretty much everything about us .  .  . 
what will you say about us ? 
i don &apos;t know where he is . 
is it for real ? 
you have no conception of this ,  do you ? 
listen to this .   a woman was kidnapped in eau claire this morning .  when a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange  &apos;clicking gibberish &apos; .  .  . 
good job ,  neither do i .  what do you do for a living ? 
i already got a real one .   come on ,  it won &apos;t be too bad .   it &apos;s not personal . 
easy ,  eduardo ,  easy .   preserve a sense of humor at all times .   okay ,  the receptor rig .  .  .  what i &apos;m putting on your head .  .  .  sends a signal to the recorder .   see we call it  &quot; being wired ,  &quot;  but there &apos;s no wire .   you gotta keep the recorder close .  .  .  five ,  six feet away max ,  like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you &apos;re going to close escrow ,  know what i mean ? 
this piece of puke hired me to kill you ,  baby .   do you believe that ?  isn &apos;t that right ,  tran ?   you pinhead . 
believe it .   now bring me the trodes ,  baby .   come on ,  quick . 
you can &apos;t just .  .  .  kill him . 
jesus . 
bobbyyyy !   tequila por favor !  double shots .   make it tres generaciones ,  huh .   nothin &apos; but the best for my good friend lenny ,  the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad .   hey ,  nice tie . 
that &apos;s not sayin &apos; much . 
he &apos;s in this somehow .  .  .  i don &apos;t know how .   just stay close to faith . 
whattya mean ? 
what stuff ? 
give him the tape .   see ?   it &apos;s fucking brilliant !   the tape for faith .   i know he &apos;ll go for it .   i can set it up . 
picture it .  .  .  i feel like i gotta share this with somebody .   it &apos;s too perfect . 
just those two loose - cannon cops running around covering their butts . 
how did you hook up with faith ? 
i said that ?   look ,  i &apos;ll take it for five ,  and you &apos;ll make out okay ,  because in this case it &apos;s pure cream ,  you don &apos;t have to cut anything back to the wearer . 
yeah .   i don &apos;t see a way out of it . 
destiny ?   you living in a perfume commercial ?   she &apos;s a hard - climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride . 
what i &apos;m saying .   but you still come out this goofball romantic . 
where we going ? 
what is it ? 
shit ! 
uh unh .   i won &apos;t do it . 
we got to make another copy of this .  little life insurance . 
whatya mean ?   we &apos;re going !   tran &apos;s gonna do her right there unless -  - 
i guess . 
that &apos;s the original .   there are no copies . 
right .   that explains it . 
what is that ? 
hey ,  isn &apos;t that tran vo ? 
agent duncan ,  there &apos;s an interstate issue up on 54 ,  run out there . 
hey ,  sheriff . 
we had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this . 
ripped off .  by hand ,  my guess .  perimortal :  victim was alive at the time ,  there &apos;s blood on his throat . 
there seems to be a discrepancy . 
yeah . 
what are you .  .  .  ? 
you &apos;re a .  .  .  you &apos;re sick . 
you &apos;re going to miss it .  pay attention . 
he was sitting here ? 
there was a car in the lot when we closed .  gone today . 
you have the photo from the diner ? 
speck .  harold speck . 
i might point out ,  agent mackelway ,  the reason we haven &apos;t been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us  -  -  which is also why you were reassigned . 
do you think he singled you out ? 
agent mackelway ,  you &apos;re going to get your wish .  you &apos;re going back to washington .  i want you back in computer crimes .  fire up those chat rooms . 
nothing concrete .  nothing i &apos;d .  .  .  well ,  nothing . 
we had every reason to believe he was on that plane .  he was supposed to be on the plane .  everything was incinerated ,  it was two weeks before we reached the crash site .  we ,  the director and i ,  decided it was in everyone &apos;s best interest to declare dick low dead .  that way he could exit a hero . 
i got a look in testa &apos;s computer .  his screen name was  &quot; imelda .  &quot;  have to give him that ,  had a sense of humor . 
how do you send out an apb on a dead man ? 
we &apos;ll wait .  get online with low ,  inform him of zero &apos;s route  -  -  we &apos;ll set a trap for him . 
i read your white paper .  it &apos;s sort of like the bible for what they &apos;re trying to do in computer crime . 
you work with koessler ? 
that &apos;s part of the reason i dropped by .  i need to learn this stuff . 
what &apos;s that ? 
every cop has a story and every story has a girl .  the girl in my story was fifteen years - old .  she wore a pink angora sweater  -  -  i can still see it  -  -  one day ,  she disappeared .  i told the police she wouldn &apos;t run away ,  i told them who to look for ,  but i was just a kid .  i sat in the police station crying and crying .  my parents took me home .  the girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher i &apos;d had .  he kept her alive a week before he killed her .  the police could have saved her .  every time i see a photo of a victim i see her .  that &apos;s what i want to do .  i want to save her . 
i saw him on a talk show once ,  talking about these killers like they were his friends .  not the victims ,  not the families of the victims ,  he doesn &apos;t talk about them .  blood money ,  that &apos;s what it is .   did he hit on you ? 
that &apos;s my point .  remember ,  you &apos;re a cop pretending to be a deviant .  it &apos;s not the other way around . 
i met with richard low .   these are names of missing persons he has flagged .  i &apos;m double - checking every case ,  but i don &apos;t want to be too obvious about it .  i marked the ones i &apos;d like you to work on . 
all the same killer ? 
who are you ? 
after my hiatus ,  after i got my priorities readjusted ,  i drifted online ,  started tracking porn chat rooms ,  looking for zero .  got accepted ,  came across these boys swapping stories ,  pictures ,  downloads .  never found zero ,  but i did come across some class a scumbags . 
is he dead ? 
but why attack an agent ? 
locate a jet ,  we &apos;re going to amarillo . 
i don &apos;t think you understand . 
you want to  &quot; profile &quot;  me ?  find out what makes me  &quot; tick &quot;  ?  write about me ,  go on a talk show ,  give me a nickname ? 
you &apos;ve been through worse . 
moving here from new york was much more of an adjustment than this . 
that &apos;s because it was a challenge .  you has control over you &apos;re situation .  it was hard ,  but you rose to it . 
you really should .  life ,  after all ,  is really just a series of challenges .  .  . 
you should call your grandmother . 
don &apos;t do it ,  mike . 
probably a little longer than that ,  but ,  whatever . 
well ,  thank you .  .  .  ? 
well ,  it wasn &apos;t the simple ,  but yeah . 
oh ,  god .  that &apos;s two more than me .  tell me it gets better . 
what else ? 
i &apos;m considering taking a job as a  &quot; goofy &quot;  . 
always .  .  . 
what do you guys do ? 
why not ? 
sorry ,  it &apos;s just that .  .  . 
well .  .  .  this is it . 
didn &apos;t you tell me to be patient with my career ? 
neither is acting .  not if you &apos;re serious about it .   can i have one of these ? 
hello ? 
hi .  sorry about that . 
i couldn &apos;t .  do you know how hard it &apos;s been not to call you ?  i pick up the phone every night .  whenever that commercial comes on .  .  . 
 .  .  . yeah ,  with the baby in the tire .  one time i started to cry right in front of pierre .  .  . 
well that sucks . 
unless she comes back first . 
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna take it . 
it &apos;s definitely a step back for me . 
do you realize how hard it &apos;s going to be to tell my parents ?  i still haven &apos;t told them i didn &apos;t get the pilot . 
the only reason i mentioned her at all is to say that i &apos;m not going to talk about her anymore .  i thought you &apos;d appreciate that . 
an eight . 
darwinism at its best . 
it &apos;s like ,  every day i see a beautiful woman .  i &apos;m not used to that .  i &apos;m used to seeing a beautiful woman ,  i don &apos;t know ,  once a week .  i can &apos;t handle it . 
charles and me went to network on this pilot together . 
oh ,  like that song .  .  . 
there are so many beautiful women here . 
wow .   you wanna grab a bite ? 
by the way ,  the guys back home said she put on some weight . 
you little bitch ! 
how &apos;s it going for you two ? 
yeah .  here it &apos;s easier to avoid trouble .  it &apos;s not like you like in compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day .  nobody &apos;s mugging you on no subway .  in new york the trouble finds you .  out here you gotta go look for it .  .  . 
thanks ,  man .   i &apos;ve been hating myself for the last two days . 
hi .  this is nikki .  leave a message .  
hi .  this is nikki .  leave a message .  
excuse me .  we &apos;re in a bit of a hurry . 
hello ? 
i &apos;m serious .  this is how you do it .  i &apos;m telling you . 
vegas ,  baby ! 
pirates of the fucking caribbean . 
this is fuckin &apos; post - pubescent disneyland . 
this place is dead .  i thought this was the city that never sleeps . 
they &apos;re all skanks .

i &apos;m telling you ,  baby ,  you always double down on an eleven . 
i don &apos;t know ,  what ?  thirty ,  forty maybe . 
twenty .  .  .  but i was down at least fifty .  i &apos;m sorry ,  i got hot at the crap table . 
she was smiling at what an asshole you are . 
you think so ? 
it &apos;s just that i &apos;ve been out of the game so long .  trent ,  i was with her for six years .  that &apos;s before aids .  i &apos;m scared .  i don &apos;t know how to talk to them ,  i don &apos;t know .  .  . 
i know .  i know . 
 .  .  . baby .  .  . 
baby ,  relax .  it &apos;s just down the hall .  she &apos;s gotta change .  .  .  we &apos;ll be fine . 
i was younger .  .  .  it was college .  you didn &apos;t go to college ,  you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like .  you screw chicks you have no business being with .  they &apos;re young ,  they don &apos;t know any better . 
selling scrap metal . 
he drives a carriage . 
i hear he drives a carriage around central park or something . 
i hear she &apos;s getting real fat . 
how you guys doing ? 
which one ? 
you looked right at her ,  baby . 
she didn &apos;t see . 
i don &apos;t know .  i guess kids were hitting each other or something .

oh ,  it &apos;s on ,  baby .  .  . 
that was pretty cold ,  dude .

 .  .  . anaheim .  .  . 
the bear &apos;s got his claws back . 
the don himself is coming to me tonight ? 
what do you wish me to do ? 
what was that ? 
you &apos;re staying home .   you &apos;re not going out . 
eat it ,  it &apos;s on the table . 
you filthy guinea spoiled brat .  clean it up or i &apos;ll kick your head in . 
the word is out in the streets that he &apos;s dead . 
clemenza .   you take care of paulie .  i don &apos;t ever want to see him again .  understood ? 
you &apos;re on ,  kid .  .  . i &apos;ll square it with mom your not seeing her before you left .   and i &apos;ll get a message to your girl friend when i think the time is right . 
i &apos;ll think about it . 
i need two million dollars in cash .  .  . more important ,  i need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested ,  they would get only light sentences .   be my friend . 
i kept trying to call you after my divorce and tom always said you were busy .   when i got the wedding invitation i knew you weren &apos;t sore at me anymore ,  godfather . 
is it necessary ? 
and now ,  what do you choose to do ? 
no ,  i wanted other things for you . 
yes ,  but sons who would be professors ,  scientists ,  musicians .  .  . and grandchildren who could be ,  who knows ,  a governor ,  a president even ,  nothing &apos;s impossible here in america . 
your wife and children .  .  . you &apos;re happy with them ? 
now that the war is over ,  enzo ,  this boy is being repatriated to italy .   and you see ,  godfather .  .  .   he .  .  . my daughter .  .  . they .  .  . 
calo and fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen . 
i know . 
is that why there are more men on the walls ? 
you had better bring a few bottles home with you ,  my friend; you &apos;ll need help sleeping tonight .  
it &apos;s the real thunderbolt ,  then . 
give them some money and send them home . 
oh christ tom ,  i didn &apos;t mean it that way . 
mr .  corleone is johnny &apos;s godfather .  that is very close ,  a very sacred religious relationship . 
i &apos;m german - irish . 
hello kay .   your father &apos;s inside ,  doing some business .   he &apos;s been asking for you . 
no .   his name is luca brasi .   you wouldn &apos;t like him . 
you like spaghetti ? 
what time do they expect us ? 
can you say it ? 
when will i see you again ? 
michael ,  it &apos;s not true .   please tell me . 
tell me ! 
all right ,  sonny .   all right . 
send some bodyguards . 
sonny .  .  . sonny -  - jesus christ ,  i &apos;m down at the hospital .   i came down late .   there &apos;s no one here .   none of tessio &apos;s people -  - no detectives ,  no one .   the old man is completely unprotected . 
i &apos;m glad you came ,  mike .   i hope we can straighten everything out .   all this is terrible ,  it &apos;s not the way i wanted things to happen at all .  it should never have happened . 
barzini &apos;s people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it .   pretty soon there won &apos;t be one place in brooklyn i can hang my hat . 
the corleone family wants to buy me out .   i buy you out .   you don &apos;t buy me out . 
the corleone family don &apos;t have that kind of muscle anymore .   the godfather is sick .   you &apos;re getting chased out of new york by barzini and the other families ,  and you think you can find easier pickings here .   i &apos;ve talked to barzini; i can make a deal with him and keep my hotel ! 
yeah . 
i think so .   detective squad ? 
sorry ,  sorry ,  sorry .  i know ,  i &apos;m late ,  i &apos;m a swine . 
fausto and i  -  -  we took the boat out ,  we were fishing ,  and then it was dawn and we &apos;d caught absolutely nothing . 
we ? 
tom was telling me about his trip over .  made me laugh so much i got a nosebleed . 
hi tom . 
okay ,  we &apos;re going to naples .  there &apos;s a club ,  it &apos;s not a club ,  it &apos;s a cellar . 
marge ,  you like everybody . 
i had to promise ,  capital p ,  never to take it off  -  -  otherwise i &apos;d give it to you . 
well ,  she was already dead ,  darling ,  wasn &apos;t she ,  so i suppose  -  - 
i &apos;m intruding . 
i &apos;m never going back ! 
i have to go to venice . 
i could fuck this icebox i love it so much .   what were you actually doing in new york ? 
without the glasses you &apos;re not even ugly .   i don &apos;t need them because i never read .  how do i look . 
what &apos;s the fight about ?  that &apos;s her fiancee ,  isn &apos;t it ?  are they blaming him ? 
esatto .  i &apos;m always planning . 
what ? 
just point her at capri and avoid the rocks . 
what about christmas ? 
i don &apos;t know ,  i don &apos;t know ,  i just know it . 
i never said that ! 
dickie ,  you can &apos;t even drive a car !  no ,  what we need urgently is an icebox .  what do you think ,  tom ?  agree with me and i &apos;ll be your friend for life . 
i have to find a birthday present for frances .  perhaps you can help me ? 
i was just looking at you  -  -   so quiet . 
thanks .  he knows i love this ,  although why it couldn &apos;t have waited .  .  . 
he hates being confronted . 
oh my god .  tom . 
tell me the truth .  did he kill freddie ? 
what ? 
did dickie &apos;s dad go ? 
you &apos;ve got dickie &apos;s rings . 
dickie promised me he would never take off this ring . 
but i hope that note goes to new york in your purse ,  for a rainy day . 
i told you !  i knew it ! 
as in the textile logues .  trying to shrug off the dress .  i travel under my mother &apos;s name ,  too . 
c &apos;mon ,  i need to talk to you .  just the two of us . 
dickie ,  my god ! 
you know ,  the whole world thinks you killed freddie ?  it &apos;s terrible . 
il signor ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali ? 
questa lettera e stata trovata nell &apos;abitazione del signor richard greenleaf a roma . 
tell him i have a fiance ,  dickie has a fiance and freddie miles probably had a string of them . 
what did he say ? 
he wants to know if you killed freddie miles and then killed dickie greenleaf ? 
i &apos;m sorry .  i was asleep .  i must have fallen asleep . 
are you okay ? 
tom ,  are you okay ? 
really ,  why ?   sorry ,  i &apos;m completely lost . 
what are you talking about  -  -  you &apos;re not a nobody !  that &apos;s the last thing you are . 
i think i just said .  ripley was handling some business for me ,  nor does mr ripley want to marry me .  nor did he ask me every day if i would marry him .  and when . 
i &apos;m not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends . 
you got a  . 44 magnum ? 
some of these guns are like toys ,  but a smith and wesson ,  man ,  you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on .  nothing beats quality .   you interested in an automatic ? 
you like ball games ? 
well ,  then ,  what is it you exactly want to do ? 
why ? 
where do you live ? 
the moon ? 
you &apos;re right !  now i remember !  it was after the western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late .  the next day i was completely bushed .  it was unbelievable . 
the dmz ? 
that &apos;s very romantic .  some of your fares must be interesting .  see any stars ,  politicians ,  deliver any babies yet ? 
you mean you work seventy - two hours a week . 
you know what you remind me of ? 
maybe i &apos;ll see you again sometime ,  huh ? 
maybe if you &apos;d try thinking once in a while ,  you &apos;d get somewhere . 
sure we could run him .  you realize he &apos;s already head of his block association . 
first ,  he &apos;s not italian .  second he &apos;s not a thief .  i noticed the fingers when he was getting my change  -  -  the right change .  two of his fingers are missing .  just stubs .  like they were blown away .  i was putting my change in my purse when i saw him get out a cigarette .  i couldn &apos;t help watching .  i was dying to see how he &apos;d light it . 
threw on the emergency ,  jumped the seat and fucked her brains out  -  -  what do you think !   what do i have to do ?  draw you a picture ? 
hello . 
that &apos;s a nice name . 
why ?  who are you ? 
no . 
can &apos;t you listen to me ?  don &apos;t you want to get out of here ? 
fuck it !  fuck it !  fuck it !  fuck it !  fuck it !  fuck it !  fuck it ! 
i ain &apos;t ever been there ,  but it don &apos;t seem like such a bad place . 
god ,  you are square . 
rock music died in 1970 ,  that &apos;s what i think .  before that it was fantastic .  i can tell you that .  everybody was crashing ,  hanging out at the fillmore .  me and my girlfriend ann used to go up the fire escape ,  you know ?  it was unbelievable .  rock stars everywhere .  that airplane  -  -  that &apos;s my group ,  man .  all libras .  but now everybody &apos;s split or got sick or busted .  i think i &apos;ll move to one of those communes in vermont ,  you know ?  that &apos;s where all the smart ones went .  i stayed here . 
you a narc ? 
no . 
there must be something .  .  . 
nice talking to you ,  travis . 
there &apos;s porno theatres for that . 
i &apos;ll work anywhere ,  anytime .  i know i can &apos;t be choosy . 
clean .  real clean .   as clean as my conscience . 
also clean . 
i &apos;m no cop . 
i &apos;m hip . 
what &apos;s the action around ? 
real down . 
stick with carla . 
no . 
thank you . 
spit it out . 
it &apos;s me sir . 
what do you do for the f . b . i .  ,  goodspeed . 
well yes i suppose  .  .  . 
john mason .    &apos; don &apos;t be shocked .   i don &apos;t have much time .   please listen carefully   .  .  .  . 
what are you doing ? 
i &apos;m sure a lot of people down in l . a .  are worried sick about you . 
not exactly light reading ,  i know .  believe it or not ,  i &apos;ve read this since high school ,  and it got me all the way through law school .  besides ,  there &apos;s something in there that &apos;ll help you .   you won &apos;t have to get very far ,  it &apos;s near the beginning . 
i &apos;m afraid not .   he looked right at your picture without batting an eye .   but it &apos;s probably temporary .  he got all the way to lawson ,  so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head .  i &apos;m sure it &apos;ll all come back to him .   it just takes a catalyst . 
when did you start smoking ? 
you tried to once .   it was pretty pitiful . 
my what ? 
what .  .  .  do you remember ? 
well ,  that &apos;s what i knew then .   or who i knew ,  i should say .   you see ,  i was trying to court miss angstrom .   i went to the meeting to impress her . 
yet you &apos;re contradicting yourself .  you earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party - run organization ,  yet you just said ,  under oath ,  that you were not now  -  -  nor ever  -  -  a member of the communist party . 
be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record . 
yes .   a prepared statement . 
i &apos;m a little hesitant to say . 
are you saying that he &apos;s .  .  . 
like ernie said ,  we &apos;re all glad to have you back . 
this is the staff of the bijou . 
luke .  .  .  what time is it ? 
i know .   everyone went home .   we offered them refunds . 
i &apos;m not happy about this ,  mind you ,  but if i have to go ,  at least i &apos;m going in my own bed ,  the same bed my lily died in ,  and .  .  .  knowing that my son is alive .   that &apos;s not too shabby ,  is it ? 
any idea how you got here ,  son ? 
that &apos;s me and my daughter adele .  my pride and joy .   charms the fish right out of the lake ,  she does . 
you kids off to the dance ? 
jesus . 
peter ,  their hands are tied .   you see that ,  don &apos;t you ? 
that &apos;s the one ,   &quot; ashes to ashes .  &quot;  i think it &apos;s great .   but it &apos;ll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head .  you can &apos;t work until you &apos;re cleared  -  -  and believe me ,  starting right now ,  i &apos;m gonna do everything i can to make that happen . 
that was quite a show you gave them today .   we shoulda sold tickets . 
her name was right there in front of them .   they gave it to me ,  i didn &apos;t give it to them . 
thank me publicly ?   for what ?   for ruining this woman &apos;s life ? 
t - t - thank you .   thank you .   i .  .  .  i always .  .  .  i always wanted to wear my uniform from the great war ,  but your daddy ,  he always said no ,  that &apos;s not an usher &apos;s u - u - uniform ,  that &apos;s an army uniform and the bijou ,  she &apos;s not the army .   they give me a medal ,  but i lost it in the h - h - hospital .   i forget things sometimes .   since the w - w - war . 
they &apos;ll come back ,  you know .  they &apos;ll all c - c - come back . 
tim ,  i have to tell you something . 
will you help me ,  sandy ? 
ancestors ? 
they all know you ? 
oh ,  hi !   did you find her all right ? 
hi .   is something wrong ?  is that cut beginning to bother you ? 
no ,  thank you .   won &apos;t you call me melanie ? 
thank you . 
well ,  i don &apos;t suppose it offers much to the casual visitor .  unless you &apos;re thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside .  it takes a while to get used to . 
isn &apos;t there ?   maybe there isn &apos;t .  maybe there &apos;s never anything between mitch and any girl . 
i think i &apos;ll have some of that ,  too .   i was seeing quite a lot of him in san francisco ,  you know .   and then ,  one weekend ,  he asked me up to meet lydia . 
then what was it ? 
what about mitch ?  didn &apos;t he have anything to say about this ? 
he wants me to go to cathy &apos;s party tomorrow afternoon .   i said i would . 
mitch knows lots of people in san francisco .  of course ,  they &apos;re mostly hoods . 
well ,  mom ,  he &apos;s the first to admit it .   he spends half his day in the detention cells at the hall of justice . 
why ,  it &apos;s just like air ,  isn &apos;t it ?   when i grow up ,  i &apos;m gonna smoke like a chimney !  i &apos;ll be eleven tomorrow ,  you know . 
we &apos;ve got an extra room upstairs and everything . 
where does he live ? 
see where i &apos;m pointing ? 
see them two big trees across there ? 
the little girl &apos;s name . 
we don &apos;t have any fog this time of year ,  mitch . 
how do you do ,  miss daniels ?   acknowledge a what ? 
tell him about the party . 
maybe we ought to leave . 
when ? 
then you knew mitch in san francisco ,  is that right ? 
then he saw . 
do you think cathy &apos;s all right ? 
no . 
he won &apos;t be back until monday .  i mean ,  if those birds are for him .  .  .  . 
that was the damndest thing i ever saw . 
to see a friend of mine .   will you please be careful ? 
i don &apos;t know .  but it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who i was ,  and where i lived and .  .  . 
you like me ,  huh ? 
certainly ,  but .  .  . 
hi .  annie had no plans ,  huh ?  i &apos;m glad you came .  are you hungry ? 
mmmm .  i like to swim .  we might get along very .  .  . 
and you didn &apos;t come up here to see her . 
what did it say ? 
like jumping into a fountain in rome ! 
i &apos;d still like to see you . 
but not for me . 
and on tuesdays ,  i take a course in general semantics at berkeley .   that &apos;s not a job ,  of course .  i just take it because .  .  . 
i don &apos;t know ,  melanie .   look ,  do you have to go back to annie &apos;s ? 
it smelled of the fire . 
yes ,  of course ,  he had to have a beard !   &apos;birds of the world ,  unite !  &apos; he kept saying ,  over and over .  .  . 
it &apos;s so damn quiet out there . 
melanie ,  melanie .  .  . 
even the birds sitting out there .  it does look very much the same ,  mitch .  this could be last week . 
when will they stop ? 
you must be exhausted . 
the power . 
that .  .  .  that .  .  .  who was that ? 
they said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon .  if you &apos;d care to come back .  .  . 
no ,  the birds didn &apos;t attack until the children were outside the school .  crows ,  i think .  i don &apos;t know ,  daddy .  is there a difference between crows and blackbirds ? 
yes ,  all right ,  i &apos;ll wait for you .  good - by .  
i don &apos;t know why . 
have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest ? 
sebastian ,  i &apos;m not an alarmist . 
i &apos;m going out that way ,  lady .  you can follow me . 
were the santa rosa police at your school today ?   are you coming ? 
mr .  gray ? 
i &apos;m only a student . 
gray has no need to threaten .  you remember the trial ? 
excuse me ,  dr .  macfarlane  -  - 
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ll have to give up medicine ,  dr .  macfarlane . 
it was about last night i wanted to talk to you  -  -  about the operation on the little marsh girl . 
but i  -  -  well ,  you see ,  sir ,  i met mrs .  marsh and told her . 
dr .  macfarlane ,  i wonder if you know what happiness you &apos;ve brought those people . 
see that ,  fettes ? 
glencorse  -  -  that &apos;s a lonely cemetery ,  fettes ,  not a soul around for miles . 
hear him ? 
you &apos;ll not need that again ,  georgina . 
he &apos;ll not leave the grave  -  -  not since wednesday last when we buried the lad . 
i &apos;m by way of being a medical myself . 
come ,  toddy  -  -  come .   sit down here with me . 
mr .  fettes and i have professional matters to discuss . 
you know what you want and don &apos;t want  -  -  so that &apos;s an end of business between us  -  -  but we &apos;ll still be friends ,  toddy .   i &apos;ll be dropping by to see you and meg once in a while  -  -  for auld lang syne ,  you know . 
i set those blocks together ,  patched the muscles .  i put the nerves where they should be  -  -  i did it and i did it right  -  -  and she won &apos;t walk  -  - 
this is a gift you &apos;ll not return . 
wait ,  toddy .  that &apos;s not hospitable .  i want to discuss business . 
you &apos;re getting old ,  gray ,  and it &apos;s a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of edinburgh  -  - 
i would make you rich . 
a pleasure to torment me ? 
can anyone hear what we say ? 
can i get you something ?  a glass of water ?  a transfusion ? 
leonard ,  dutton ,  erlich .  they don &apos;t matter .  i want the king . 
you killed her .  i saw it . 
what did they give you ? 
the scar .  which of you has it ? 
erin .  it &apos;s not your fault . 
it &apos;s ok ,  it &apos;s ok .  .  . 
 .  .  .  it connects you to me .  .  .

my father has gone to a better place . 
where do they take them ?  ! 
you won &apos;t even try ? 
i wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she &apos;s in for ? 
 &#93 beat] listen ,  i hate to bother you .  .  . 
i &apos;m just looking at you .  does that make you uncomfortable ? 
i &apos;ve managed to every sunday of my life .   &#93 beat] some of us are god -  fearing men ,  starks . 
do i know you from somewhere ? 
my father used to talk about you . 
i &apos;m sorry i can &apos;t tell you more about your father &apos;s death ,  mr .  starks .  our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the alpine grove &apos;s staff changed and i &apos;m afraid we didn &apos;t have the best record system before then . 
no ,  i don &apos;t .  i &apos;m sorry .  i wish i knew more . 
come on ,  mom .  don &apos;t fall asleep .  .  . 
what &apos;re those ? 
how &apos;d he die ? 
do you really believe me ? 
 &#93 softly] i want to trust you .  should i trust you ? 
then we need to figure out what happened to you .  it &apos;s the only thing we can do . 
i have no idea . 
why ? 
of course it makes me mad .  it makes me more than mad .  just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him .  but what &apos;s it gonna do for me to find them now ?  i can &apos;t fix everything in three days . 
me ,  too . 
they &apos;re not here . 
then why isn &apos;t there anyone around ? 
i think so . 
yeah ,  i did .   &#93 beat] he was my most memorable patient . 
so maybe dr .  becker would know .   &#93 beat] but ,  as i &apos;m sure you know ,  the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities . 
no ,  i do .  that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying to you . 
 &#93 beat] like who ?  like mackenzie maybe ? 
why not ? 
and how do you know that ? 
i don &apos;t know when it &apos;ll happen but soon i think ,  you &apos;ll shock the boy and it &apos;ll wake him up . 
mortality &apos;s actually a great thing to be familiar with .  it means you &apos;re sane on some level . 
great .  that was our last option .  what am i going to do with you ? 
 &#93 beat] yeah ,  i &apos;m fine . 
you want a drink ? 
hon . 
how do you know i took it ?   how do you know they didn &apos;t just give it to me ? 
could you identify  &apos;em ,  if ya saw  &apos;em again ?

i swear to god ,  she wouldn &apos;t tell me one thing !   christ !   you oughta try to find that kid that was with  &apos;em . 
hey !   don &apos;t let them shoot those girls .   this is too much .   they got guns pointed at  &apos;em ! 
i &apos;m sorry to bother you ,  i know you &apos;re real busy right now ,  but how many times ,  max ?   how many times has that woman gotta be fucked over ?  you could lift one finger and save her ass and you won &apos;t even do that ? 
don &apos;t .   i &apos;m married .   i don &apos;t feel good .   i &apos;ve been sick . 
don &apos;t hurt me .   harlan .   please . 
well ,  if you don &apos;t mind me sayin &apos; so ,  he sounds like a real asshole . 
louise ,  is that you ? 
you &apos;re a bank robber ? 
no ,  i mean how would you do it ?   do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what ? 
i may be the outlaw ,  but you &apos;re the one stealin &apos; my heart . 
i am funny .   i &apos;m real funny .

alright .  .  .   i changed my mind .   i &apos;ll have a margarita with and a shot of cuervo on the side ,  please . 
why don &apos;t you tell him to just to get lost once and for all ? 
we have to think this through .   we have to be smart .   now is not the time to panic .   if we panic now ,  we &apos;re done for .   nobody saw it .  nobody knows it was us .   we &apos;re still okay .   now all we have to do is just figure out our next move . 
we &apos;re gonna go to the next town and stop .   we &apos;ll get a motel room .   i can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money .   we &apos;re gonna need money .   thelma .   how much money do you have with you ? 
i &apos;m cash poor . 
well ,  what &apos;s the big rush ,  thelma ?  if we just give  &apos;em some time ,  they &apos;ll come to us .  .  .  !   oh christ .  i &apos;m just not ready to go to jail yet .   why don &apos;t you go out to the pool or something and i &apos;ll figure it out .  .  . 
but you think he fools around . 
louise ,  this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride ,  and i thought since .  .  .

now you get a grip ,  louise !   just drive us to goddamn mexico ,  will ya ! 
no we shouldn &apos;t ,  but i want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last goddamn crime !

i &apos;m just saying i don &apos;t mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly .  it means he &apos;s a guy .  you can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections . 
don &apos;t you want to know my name ? 
what are you doing with all these blueprints ? 
i &apos;m kidding .  yeah ,  i guess you could call me an architect  -  -  it &apos;s just a job really ,  a way to keep me moving .  my real passion is my hobby . 
 -  -  there &apos;s this one kid ,  we call him mongo on account of he &apos;s a mongoloid .  he got out of his cage once and  -  - 
ah ,  i &apos;d sell that .  start fresh in a new place ,  quit the architect game ,  slow things down ,  read more books ,  see more movies .  .  .

he &apos;s right ,  jack .  taylor is saying we may have some time .  we &apos;ve got to use it . 
well ,  i &apos;m not .

think about it .   your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure .  everything after that -  - the chases ,  the trip to mars ,  your suite here at the hilton -  - these are all elements of your rekall holiday .   and ego trip :  you paid to be a secret agent .

it worked !   there they go ! 
i don &apos; need a hospital .  .  .  i feel fine . 
and the one on the right is the bullet you test - fired from shu &apos;s gun ? 
you would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun ? 
forensic ballistics isn &apos;t an exact science ,  is it ? 
objection ,  your honor !  the fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial ! 
good morning ,  mr .  dowd .  do you think you might be up to cross - examining mr .  ortega this morning ? 
come now .  did you see the gun ? 
kim got busted at 19 for burglary .  at 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young chinese gang lord .  .  .  the prosecution claimed kim did it to get into  &quot; the joe boys &quot;  ?

so what &apos;re we gonna do ? 
well ,  i mean ,  roeder &apos;s gone ,  now .  .  .  a dead end .  believe me ,  i &apos;m sorry too ,  but .  .  .

edward t .  dowd . 
you won &apos;t remember this ,  but in  &apos;72 i was one of several prosecutors assigned to the black panther - police shootout .   we had a whole team ,  and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt .   so what &apos;ve you been up to since then ? 
back in the seventies i spent years putting away gangsters in a colombian syndicate called  &quot; the ochoa &quot;  .  these guys are very dangerous ,  ed .  when i hear that a small - time dope lawyer is conniving to spring one of these guys ,  i see red . 
i see :  he &apos;d walk out next month . 
but now you &apos;ve strayed from your area of expertise  -  -  dope  -  -  into street assassins .  a subject on which you &apos;re dangerously ignorant . 
isn &apos;t it a fact that the  &quot; six other asian men &quot;  in the line - up were all of the classic mongoloid type ,  whereas shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a korean ? 
isn &apos;t it unusual for a man who &apos;s just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment ? 
to the best of your recollection ,  were you sober when you performed the tests ? 
 -  -  can &apos;t mr .  dowd find his own expert witness ,  your honor ? 
yes ,  mr .  dowd . 
lou sklaroff ,  vin badalato ,  dave montell .

sheriff cable &apos;s already asked me a few questions about teresa banks .  she worked nights for a month .  that &apos;s it . 
lil was wearing a sour face . 
crushed skull .  probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object .  subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age . 
i doubt it was drugs ,  more likely a problem with a nerve .  i could recheck the arm for injuries ,  but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to portland . 
take a look at this . 
i couldn &apos;t help but notice that you had a suspicion that deputy cliff was the murderer .  you did think that ,  didn &apos;t you ,  agent desmond ? 
when he says ,   &quot; discussion &quot;  ,  how do you take that ,  agent desmond ? 
don &apos;t tell me now .  tell me right before the test .  i won &apos;t be able to remember long enough . 
are you going to see james tonight ? 
you &apos;re telling me ,  but only because you never let me in on any of it .  .  .  you &apos;re not going to see bobby ,  are you ?

oh ,  laura . 
say anything you want .  .  .  i know you love me and i love you . 
when he finds out . 
no . 
i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s right or wrong ,  it &apos;s just the way i feel .  it &apos;s the custom thing i was thinking of .  in america we don &apos;t use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides .  we throw away the tail ,  the rest of the insides and the head . 
oh ,  honey ,  you don &apos;t have to lie to me .  ever .  you can tell me anything .  i &apos;ll understand . 
my god ,  i am going to have another breakdown .  god ,  god . 
if it &apos;s okay with you i &apos;m going to bobby &apos;s to do my homework .

get rid of him ? 
you need to explain it . 
well ,  like kill him with the atomic bomb ? 
but where in the head ?  not the chin ,  i hope .

by who ? 
heard you was goin &apos; out with that bitch &apos;s daughter . 
i know .  .  .  i remember . 
i ain &apos;t heard of nothin &apos; . 
it &apos;s the chancellor . 
if it can produce a miss sloviak you &apos;ll get no argument from me . 
trip ?  ? 
he &apos;s a boxer .  a flyweight . 
james ?  my james ?  what &apos;s happened ? 
good god .  let &apos;s go rescue him . 
you know  -  -  based on what i &apos;ve read  -  -  this is a very exciting piece of material ,  this big parade . 
i &apos;ve been doing this a long time ,  tripp .  i feel this kid in my bones . 
oh ,  christ ,  don &apos;t start on ol &apos; gran or we &apos;ll leave you here . 
so modest . 
oh !  huh .  exactly how do we do that ? 
the hood jumper ? 
you &apos;ll be all right then .  look at carlyle ,  when he lost his luggage . 
or hemingway ,  when hadley lost all those stories . 
you driving this car ? 
is that in my chart ? 
not true .  you &apos;re the only vernon i know .  actually ,  i &apos;m wrong .  i once knew a vernon peabody at penguin u . k . 
boy or girl ? 
sure . 
sara ?  hi .  it &apos;s grady . 
relax ,  james .  i &apos;m not her father .  i just rent her a room . 
so what are you doing out here ? 
it &apos;s feels unreal ,  like butterfly wings or .  .  .  something .  it must &apos;ve cost dr .  gaskell a lot . 
i &apos;m sorry .  professor tripp .  maybe it &apos;s seeing that jacket that belonged to her .  it just looks .  .  .  really lonely .  hanging there .  in a closet .  maybe i &apos;m just a little sad . 
can i ask you something about her ? 
huh ?  oh ,  no .  this isn &apos;t emily &apos;s .  i just write in it . 
i think it &apos;s sort of writing itself at this point . 
colon cancer . 
it &apos;s a bit of a scandal .  my parents live in a small town . 
carvel . 
it &apos;s a hellhole .  three motels and a mannequin factory .  my dad worked there for thirty - five years . 
i just wanted a little sip . 
what ? 
yes you did .  last night .  to your friend crabtree .   &quot; is he any good ?  &quot;  he said .  and you said :   &quot; not yet he isn &apos;t .  &quot;  i heard you myself . 
i &apos;m sorry . 
i &apos;m not going with them . 
get out of here . 
does she mean  -  -  does she know about .  .  .  her dog ? 
he &apos;s going with me .  you take crabtree .  and his friend .  all right ? 
that strikes me as odd . 
his bag .  you know that ratty green thing he &apos;s always carrying around .  he must &apos;ve left it inside . 
but where ?  i need the street . 
i uh ,  i didn &apos;t finish ,  i .  .  .  fell asleep . 
i &apos;m sure . 
emily left me this morning . 
almost .  want to sit up ?   what &apos;s the matter ? 
who &apos;s gun is that ? 
you heard ?  how ? 
what &apos;s he doing out there ? 
does he still love you ? 
that &apos;s a nice greenhouse . 
you mean because his career &apos;s ruined and all ? 
who &apos;s this  ? 
excuse me ? 
what exactly are we doing here ,  professor tripp ? 
holy shit .  are you serious ? 
maybe i should read it . 
huh ?  oh ,  someone pulled a b&e on dr .  gaskell &apos;s closet .  and the dog &apos;s missing . 
well ,  q certainly will .  and ,  given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour .  .  . 
you look good ,  damn good ,  considering you &apos;re an old man now ! 
five years . 
i &apos;ll never forget you got me started there . 
hey ,  is that a school ? 
fucking mariners . 
i &apos;ve got some good news . 
anna will be away at camp .  the house will be quiet .  it &apos;s better when it &apos;s quiet . 
i get horny as hell for other women .   i mean i fantasize about raping some beautiful woman . 
carlos ,  can i ask you something ? 
there &apos;s a million birds here . 
try . 
not too far .   are you a bird - watcher too ? 
what are you writing in that book ? 
a pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends . 
you tell me your name ,  i &apos;ll tell you mine . 
i think you do . 
doesn &apos;t everybody ? 
it &apos;s not for sale . 
okay ? 
you walked home . 
this one guy on death row ,  who i &apos;ll call henry ,  told me about his last victim .  henry says how he &apos;s in the bedroom of a seven - year - old cutie named adele .  her mother &apos;s in the living room watching tv .  she &apos;s got the volume on so damn high he can hear david letterman &apos;s jokes .  henry puts his hand over adele &apos;s mouth and says ,   &quot; if you scream ,  little girl ,  i &apos;ll kill your mother .  &quot;  and of course little adele doesn &apos;t scream ,  doesn &apos;t cry ,  doesn &apos;t make a sound .  then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door .   ten days later they find adele &apos;s body .  or what &apos;s left of it .   you believe in fairy tales ? 
you sure you don &apos;t know nothing about this ? 
yeah ,  like the bird . 
a long time ago ,  i was sent far away .  when they let me come back ,  all my friends were gone . 
i &apos;m sure .  thank you all the same . 
my daddy lets me sit on his lap . 
tell ms .  kramer what your daddy does . 
you said you couldn &apos;t make the sound of a solitary vireo .  but you did .  beautifully .  i heard you . 
but will he .  .  .   ? 
i don &apos;t want to hurt my daddy . 
it &apos;s getting dark .  go home . 
i &apos;d like you to keep a journal . 
because if you did ,  i know a therapist named ryan .  i also know a therapist named chung . 
will i ever be normal ? 
how do you define it ? 
i don &apos;t know . 
of course it is !  that &apos;s why i &apos;m telling you ! 
we &apos;ll talk about it more on thursday . 
but roughly ,  how old ? 
what ? 
i &apos;m talking about you . 
i thought you were just shy ,  but now i think it &apos;s something else . 
i &apos;m not easily shocked . 
so .  .  .  what &apos;s your dark secret ? 
so ,  you &apos;re not a dyke . 
so ,  what did you do ? 
being here ,  with me . 
maybe this isn &apos;t a good idea . 
we should live together . 
i don &apos;t even know how to live with myself . 
what &apos;s this ? 
don &apos;t do that . 
goddamnit !   d &apos;you tell him we need it right now ? 
right through the brainpan .   deader &apos;n dogshit ,  boss . 
i &apos;m taking you back out . 
okay ,  jammer .   no problem .   you stay right here .  i have to go there to the end .  .  .  you &apos;ll see my lights .   we &apos;ll stay in voice contact .   just hold onto the rope .   five more minutes .   okay ? 
we were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work .   we had over seven thousand feet of hole down for chrissake .   i can &apos;t believe you let them grab my rig ! 
what happened ? 
need some help ? 
what about o - 2 ? 
hey ,  lins .  .  .   i &apos;m glad your here . 
he &apos;s got the shakes ? 
okay ,  i &apos;m gonna free - swim to hatch six .  .  .  get inside ,  get the door open from the other side . 
okay .  .  .  okay .   we gotta get you out of here . 
okay ,  look ,  you swim to the rig and come back with another suit . 
alright ,  put this on . 
don &apos;t argue ,  goddamnit ,  just -  - 
lindsey ,  just put the thing on and shut up -  - 
 &apos;fish &apos; ? 
cat ,  you tie onto this manifold .   there &apos;s some tanks on the other side; i &apos;m gonna go check them out . 
quiet !   quiet ! 
copy that ,  continuing forward .   you just want me to get shots of everything ,  right ? 
you &apos;re right .  .  .  i don &apos;t .   i just need to know that this thing is out of here !   you hear me ,  roger ramjet ? 
no .   just you and me .   we get some proof ,  then tell them .   hippy ,  look .  .  .  if was can prove to coffey it &apos;s not russians ,  maybe he &apos;ll ease off the button a little . 
getting a reading ? 
a little more so this time . 
in this case ,  getting married means nothing .  aren &apos;t we already the same as being married ?  and corrado and giulia  -  -  aren &apos;t they already the same as being married ? 
no .  it &apos;s not enough .  .  .  i told you before that i would like to get away for a while and be alone . 
i mean ,  to stay away longer  -  -  two months .  .  .  a year .  .  .  three years .  .  .  yes ,  i know ,  it sounds absurd .  and i feel awful .  the very idea of losing you makes me want to die .  .  .  and yet .  .  .  i .  .  .  i just don &apos;t have the same feeling for you any more . 
but where are you going ? 
and how long will you be away ? 
as far as i &apos;m concerned ,  i think she &apos;s alive .  .  .  why ,  even this morning .  .  .  that business about the shark .  .  .  it wasn &apos;t at all true . 
you &apos;re very fond of anna ,  aren &apos;t you ? 
oh ,  sandro .  .  . 
promise that you won &apos;t try to look for me .  .  .  you shouldn &apos;t try to look for me any more .  .  . 
any news ? 
let &apos;s get out of here ,  fast .  .  .  this is not a town ,  it &apos;s a cemetery . 
what is it ,  claudia ? 
and you leave me here all alone .  .  .  in this hotel room .  .  . 
did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby ? 
i just can &apos;t leave without first searching those islands ,  one by one . 
it &apos;s as smooth and slick as oil . 
how did you spend the night ?  .  .  .  in that hut ?  .  .  .  and what did you have to eat ? 
let &apos;s try to be practical about this .  the best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station ,  or something ,  and report the disappearance .  i &apos;ll remain here .  .  .  because .  .  .  well ,  i don &apos;t know ,  but it seems to me that something may turn up .  anyway ,  i just don &apos;t feel like leaving . 
claudia ,  i know how you feel ,  but there are already two of us staying .  .  . 
because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman . 
i only exchanged a few casual words with her ,  as one would ordinarily do on a public bus .  .  . 
but where did you come from ? 
and here &apos;s sandro .   why don &apos;t you two go upstairs and change ? 
why have we stopped ? 
now ,  tell the truth ,  aren &apos;t you a bit disappointed ?  .  .  .  but i already told you .  .  . 
pardon me ,  but why must i do you a favor ? 
but she watches .  .  .  she listens . 
of god . 
what do you mean ? 
hello .  i &apos;m doctor livingston .  i &apos;ve been asked to talk to you .  may i ? 
i just heard you . 
where do you meet ? 
i don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re talking about .  .  .  you want to talk about the baby .  .  .  everybody wants to talk about the baby but .  .  .  i never saw the baby so i can &apos;t talk about the baby because .  .  .  i don &apos;t believe in the baby . 
what do you mean ? 
anything ? 
what &apos;s your real name ? 
would you like to be ? 
do you have any children ? 
would you like some ? 
what else did she tell you ? 
who ? 
do you ? 
do you believe she really saw them ? 
did you ever want to be a mother yourself ? 
if you did want one ,  how &apos;d you go about getting one ? 
sometimes ,  yes . 
how ? 
and that you &apos;re stupid ? 
what ? 
and why am i here ? 
how did you have a baby ? 
why ? 
why were you afraid ? 
would you like to tell me ? 
and then what happened ? 
who ? 
my bed . 
who ? 
do you remember what just happened ? 
she said michael . 
yes . 
it &apos;s bleeding .  .  .  i &apos;m bleeding .  .  .  my god it won &apos;t stop ,  i can &apos;t get it to stop .   let go of me ,  i wish you were dead . 
stay away from me .  .  . 
no .  .  . 
i hate him for what he did to me . 
god !   it was god .   and now i &apos;ll burn in hell because i hate him . 
martha ,  you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law . 
something they .  .  .  that they overlooked . 
i don &apos;t know . 
 ?  ?  ? 
hello ,  mama   .  .  .  brought you something . 
i thought cherry - vanilla was your favourite . 
the convent was built for over fifty .  not many of us left .  .  .  just us and the chickens . 
yes . 
was there a priest ? 
she can &apos;t even remember the birth .  do you think she &apos;d admit to the conception ? 
yes ,  but that was some ten months ago .  i fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial . 
don &apos;t ask me those questions dear ,  i &apos;m not the patient . 
i &apos;ve already told you what i thought . 
do you remember anything unusual happening at the time ? 
we &apos;ll see about that . 
bullshit yourself ! 
who said anything about the catholic church .  .  . 
i &apos;m out of prac .  .  .    .  .  .  practice .  
well you can try ,  can &apos;t you ,  to be good ? 
if we want to hire a psychiatrist for agnes .  we &apos;ll find our own ,  thank you .  
don &apos;t be ridiculous . 
who knew she was pregnant ? 
for what ?   an abortion ? 
too late for what ? 
of course ,  john . 
oh don &apos;t be so stroppy ! 
yeah ,  i &apos;ve blown school out . 
no ,  ginger ,  eddy fallon and ding dong . 
shurrup ! 
i don &apos;t snore . 
eh ,  ringo ,  do you know what happened to me ? 
look ,  i &apos;m terribly sorry but i &apos;m afraid there &apos;s been some sort of a misunderstanding . 
well ,  not your real opinion ,  naturally .  it &apos;ll be written out and you &apos;ll learn it .   can he read ? 
that &apos;s not your grandfather . 
you see ,  he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher . 
aye ,  but don &apos;t rush .  none of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff . 
sure .   . 
ringo ! 
yes ,  he &apos;s filled his head with notions seemingly . 
gear ? 
what are you ? 
do you think i haven &apos;t noticed  .  .  .  do you think i wasn &apos;t aware of the drift ?  oh  .  .  .  you poor unfortunate scuff ,  they &apos;ve driven you into books by their cruel ,  unnatural treatment ,  exploiting your good nature . 
you &apos;re only right . 
where are you off to ? 
shush !  have they roughed you up yet ? 
well ,  you got me here so do your worst but i &apos;ll take one of you with me .   oh ,  i know your game ,  get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but i &apos;ll defy you still . 
and we &apos;re looking after him ,  are we ? 
stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him . 
and to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars ! 
yeah  .  .  .  so what ? 
eh ,  he &apos;s a nice old man ,  isn &apos;t he ? 
aye ,  that &apos;s what i &apos;m afraid of ! 
gie &apos;s a kiss ! 
she &apos;s going to show me her stamp collection . 
don &apos;t move ,  any of you .  they &apos;ve gone potty out there .  the whole place is surging with girls . 
don &apos;t cane me ,  sir ,  i was led astray . 
leave him alone ,  he &apos;s got swine fever . 
hi norm ! 
oh you are ,  i know you are . 
and my nose .  .  . 
you &apos;re a window rattler ,  son . 
it &apos;ll only get you into trouble . 
temper !  temper ! 
well ! 
and ? 
eh ,  where &apos;s my grandfather ? 
what do you think are you &apos;re up to ? 
do i have to raise me voice ? 
eh .  i thought you were looking after the old man . 
i &apos;ll set john on you ! 
i &apos;m going to buy a cattle ranch . 
there could be a whole city out there and we &apos;d never see it . 
gravity ? 
it &apos;s .  .  .  basalt .   rock . 
appears to be a door hanging open ,  the entrance is clogged with debris . 
what &apos;s up ? 
what is it ? 
dell ,  you want to come down ,  we can figure out where to go from here . 
don &apos;t you remember ? 
what happened to the lights ? 
what the hell &apos;s going on ? 
hurt !   how ? 
boy do i feel a lot better .   it &apos;s a straight shot back to the colonies ,  and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt .   any bets on the top bid ? 
and then we run out of food and oxygen . 
well ,  uh .  .  .  good luck .   i hope you won &apos;t need me ,  but if you do ,  i &apos;m here . 
it &apos;s clear . 
god ,  that smoke &apos;s poisonous ! 
i never saw anything like that in my life .  .  .  except molecular acid . 
there .   should be coming through about there . 
he &apos;s running a fever . 
we &apos;ve got six hours left . 
what ?   what was that ? 
this is horrible . 
 .  .  .  and broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle . 
sandy ,  you want to give us some vision ? 
what &apos;s the frequency ? 
what &apos;d he say ? 
it &apos;s stopped ? 
they &apos;re getting pretty close now . 
first thing i &apos;m going to do when we get back is eat some biological food . 
where are we ? 
oh my god . 
it &apos;s out of focus . 
what the hell happened ? 
martin ,  uh ,  we &apos;ve found it . 
but ? 
find anything we missed ? 
thank christ !   we lost you !   listen ,  there &apos;s been a new development  -  - 
we can &apos;t leave him out here ,  open the door . 
where did the parasites come from ? 
i think the best thing to do with broussard is to just freeze him as he is .   it &apos;ll arrest the progress of his disease ,  and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the colonies . 
we won &apos;t need it then . 
what &apos;s it doing ,  having a seizure ? 
two down ,  four to go . 
you know ,  it &apos;s funny  -  -  this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up  -  -  this treasure ,  the paydirt  -  -  it &apos;ll make it back to irth just fine  -  -  even if we &apos;re not with it . 
yes ,  and maybe launch the boat and blow it too .  .  .  if the others are injured . 
and you stand aside while we drive it in ,  then shut the hatch ,  launch the boat ,  and  -  - 
headache ?   dehydration ? 
what is it ? 
good argument for gun - control .   what are you going after ,  rhino ? 
unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far ,  but the numbers are all over the place . 
auto - shop &apos;s sealed ,  but those boys are cut - off . 
deal . 
ah ,  quit griping .   keeps you in shape doesn &apos;t it ? 
hey ,  guttierez ? 
whoa ,  wait a minute .  .  . 
secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system .   i found the grating ripped right off .   the little fucker was strong . 
nobody wander off on their own until it &apos;s found .   keep in pairs .  diller ,  once the first team &apos;s done their sweep i want you to go down with annie to three - pump while she replaces it . 
we had to .   they were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you &apos;re gonna have to negotiate .   besides ,  all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where i doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference ,  anyway .   maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick . 
and .  .  .  ? 
they &apos;ve changed their heading again . 
it &apos;s not all good news .   we had to take off the helmet lights .   you &apos;ll be going in blind . 
yeah .   somebody won . 
i &apos;m going to need you to co - sign the report .   until we come up with something ,  this &apos;ll be treated as first degree murder . 
they .  .  . they snapped my legs to fit .  .  .  fit me in here .   i don &apos;t .  .  . remember what happened next . 
today &apos;s party &apos;s finished their sweep ,  the relief team &apos;s out there now .  everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto - shop . 
of course your performance was no surprise to me .  after the other day i regarded it as no more than  -  a promised fulfilled . 
san francisco .  an oasis of civilization in the california desert .  tell me ,  do you share my high opinion of san francisco ? 
i &apos;m not surprised .  after all that humble pie .  .  . 
heart to heart ?  woman to woman ?  including a casual reference to the part of  &quot; cora &quot;   -  and your hopes of playing it . 
we &apos;re ? 
addison ,  just a few minutes ago .  when i told you this would be a night to remember  -  that it would bring me everything i wanted - 
so that &apos;s it .  lloyd .  still just the theater ,  after all .  .  . 
addison ,  won &apos;t it be just perfect ?  lloyd and i  -  there &apos;s no telling how far we can go .  .  .  he &apos;ll write great plays for me ,  i &apos;ll make them be great !   you &apos;re the only one i &apos;ve told ,  the only one that knows except lloyd and me .  .  . 
a matter of opinion .  granted .  it is also true that you worked in a brewery .  but life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it .  as a matter of fact ,  it got less and less dull  -  until you boss &apos;s wife had your boss followed by detectives ! 
that isn &apos;t a waiter ,  my dear .  that &apos;s a butler . 
tell me this .  do they have auditions for television ? 
you &apos;ve heard of her great interest in the theater - 
eve was incredibly modest .  she insisted that no credit was due her ,  that lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them . 
you &apos;ve already met . 
oh well .  .  .    .  .  .  look through the wigs ,  maybe it got caught - 
 -  you &apos;re a setup for some gorgeous wide - eyed young babe . 
bill .  .  .  bill ,  it &apos;s your birthday . 
it &apos;s a good thought . 
need any help ? 
for instance what ? 
mad !  darling ,  there are certain characteristics for which you are famous  -  on stage and off .  i love you for some of them  -  and in spite of others .  i haven &apos;t let those become too important to me .  they &apos;re part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment  -  you &apos;ve got to keep your teeth sharp .  all right .  but you will not sharpen them on me  -  or on eve .  .  . 
many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body .  where has it been laid out ? 
i mix what i like . 
i will not calm down ! 
 -  shows up for an audition when everyone knew i &apos;d be here .  .  .  and gives a performance !  out of nowhere  -  gives a performance ! 
i  -  i don &apos;t know ,  bill .  just a feeling ,  i don &apos;t know .  .  . 
the so - called art of acting is not one for which i have a particularly high regard .  .  . 
something simple .  a fur coat over a nightgown .  .  . 
never try to outguess margo . 
yes ,  dear . 
with the paper to prove it . 
why ? 
eighty percent of it will go for taxes . 
ah .  .  . 
yes .  yes ,  it does . 
then face it .  i have .  since that first night  -  here  -  in the dressing room . 
you think ? 
you hear all kinds of things . 
and this is my good friend and companion ,  miss birdie coonan . 
why not ? 
she &apos;s loyal and efficient - 
she thinks only for me .  .  .    .  .  .  doesn &apos;t she ? 
there was nothing he didn &apos;t know .   there &apos;s a message from the bartender .  does miss channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake ? 
that &apos;s the door . 
you see the play ?  you &apos;ve seen the play every performance ?   but ,  don &apos;t you find it  -  i mean apart from everything else  -  don &apos;t you find it expensive ? 
discouraging ,  isn &apos;t it ?  women with furs like that where it never gets cold .  .  . 
eve .  i &apos;m fond of margo too .  but i know margo .  and every now and then there is nothing i want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants . 
karen .  .  .    .  .  .  you won &apos;t forget ,  will you ?  what we talked about before ? 
eve .  i &apos;ve heard the most wonderful things about your performance - 
tell me .  how did your lunch turn out  -  with the man from hollywood ? 
but the raves about your performance - 
well .  if i didn &apos;t come to see the play ,  i wouldn &apos;t have anywhere else to go . 
what  -  again ? 
i mean the performance .  except for you ,  you &apos;d think he &apos;d never even directed it  -  it &apos;s disgraceful the way they change everything around .  .  . 
the hors d &apos;oeuvres are here .  is there anything else i can do ? 
 .  .  .  and if you &apos;d come in the middle ,  i &apos;d have stopped ,  i couldn &apos;t have gone on - 
autograph fiends !  they &apos;re not people  -  those little beast who run in packs like coyotes - 
well .  .  .  there &apos;s one indoors now .  i &apos;ve brought her back to see you . 
that little place just two hours form new york .  it &apos;s on my list of things - i &apos;ll - never - understand .  like collecting shrunken indian heads .  .  . 
how far to the station ? 
why should he  -  and why should you ? 
it get better !   &quot;  -  about the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched first ladies of the stage to encourage ,  shall we say  -  younger  -  actresses; about miss harrington &apos;s own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity -  &quot; 
 -  don &apos;t run out of adjectives ,  dear . 
i just don &apos;t want margo to miss her train .  as it is ,  she &apos;ll barely make the theater .  .  . 
no ,  i got the idea myself  -  while she was talking to me .  .  . 
margo channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years ,  half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise ! 
margo  -  and bill  -  want us to meet them at the cub room tonight ,  after theater .  for a bottle of wine . 
i &apos;m glad bill &apos;s back . 
honey chili had a point .  you know ,  i can remember plays about women  -  even from the south  -  where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers .  .  . 
 .  .  .  as young as they want ,  you mean .  and i &apos;m not interested in whether thousands of people think i &apos;m six or six hundred - 
you knew when you came in that the audition was over ,  that eve was your understudy !  playing that childish game of cat and mouse .  .  . 
i never said it was ! 
make it bergdorf goodman .  .  .  and now everything is on its proper shelf ,  eh ,  max ?  done up in little ribbons .  i could die right now and nobody &apos;d be confused .  how about you ,  max ? 
when &apos;s the audition ? 
you get quick action ,  don &apos;t you ? 
this is for lawyers to talk about ,  this concerns a run - of - the - play contract ,  and this you can &apos;t rewrite or ad lib ! 
carl ? 
goddamnit -  - 
who &apos;s first ? 
anything you &apos;ve got . 
you think we &apos;re being set up ?  -  - christ ,  deep throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the white house and up traipses marilyn naming names . 
you think this was clawsen &apos;s initiation ? 
 -  - sloan told the grand jury -  - he answered everything they asked him -  -  that means there &apos;s a record somewhere -  - 
how many fucking sources they think we got ?  -  - 
 -  - jeeeeeeesus -  -

harry ,  i just talked to a miami investigator about barker -  - 
i &apos;m the one sent you to toronto ,  bernstein -  - 
down to miami and back -  - how much damage can i do ? 
 -  - he was going to go into law practice with segretti . 
 -  - no -  - 
i thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story -  -    -  - you think i like being aced out ? 
 -  - if he did it or just said he did it ,  god knows . 
 -  - bernstein ,  are you sure on this story ? 
hannah ,  i never would have bothered you but i &apos;m off to miami and they &apos;re gonna take away my ten speed unless i get it straightened out fast . 
 -  - you don &apos;t really think you &apos;re being followed ? 
if you don &apos;t like it down there ,  why don &apos;t you quit ? 
hey ,  easy .  .  . 
that &apos;s another of the things i &apos;m not so sure of . 
we were never told flat out  &quot; don &apos;t talk .  &quot;  but the message was clear . 
 -  - that leaves haldeman ,  period . 
then it &apos;s our asses ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
 -  - i don &apos;t know ,  i don &apos;t know ,  it feels thin -  -

worse than that  -  -  she was the wife of my best friend  -  -  and i was mad for her .  but i knew it was hopeless  -  -  so i decided to end it all .  i went to a pawnshop and bought a forty - five automatic and drove up to eden park  -  -  do you know cincinnati ?

does he have people ? 
how the hell were they smart enough to find us ? 
i &apos;m not gonna carry you out of here . 
why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in ? 
ice is too thin  -  -  you can see the water moving underneath .

call me as soon as you &apos;re settled . 
have they done skin testing for allergies ? 
last week i was playing the piano for him and he likes it ,  and so i decide i &apos;m going to make a little joke .  .  . 
this is not a sexist thing .  if you were a waiter i would still be here saying .  .  . 
i am trying to keep emotions out of this .  even though this is an important issue to me and i have strong feelings about the subject . 
what needs clearing up ? 
i &apos;m not kidding . 
oh ,  i &apos;m sorry .  .  .  didn &apos;t i say ,   &quot; what ?  &quot;  i thought i said ,   &quot; what ?  &quot;  .  .  .  what ?

i  -  -  uh ,  i .  .  .  well ,  there is no place cards or anything . 
hey  -  -  you let him .  .  . 
 .  .  .  my father didn &apos;t leave his room for 11 years  -  -  he hit my hand with a yardstick if i made a mistake on the piano . 
well ,  ah .  .  .  that &apos;s a personal question . 
that &apos;s why you brought me ?  look at me !  is that really why you brought me .  .  .  like i &apos;m a what and i owe you what ?  ! 
i &apos;ll never forget you said it . 
nothing like no choice to make you feel at home . 
i don &apos;t want to hear that music right now . 
here are the keys to my apartment .  i &apos;m going to park you in my place while i take carol home . 
that seems like a good choice . 
because .  .  . 
if you need an excuse ,  there &apos;s a bakery on the corner .  there &apos;s a shot it &apos;ll open soon  -  -  that way we &apos;re not screwy  -  -  we &apos;re just two people who like warm rolls . 
hey ,  i &apos;ve got a great compliment for you . 
can you not be violent ? 
i &apos;ve got to sketch you . 
that long neck  -  -  the line of you .  .  .  you &apos;re porcelain .  .  .  your back goes on forever .  you &apos;re classic .  .  .  you &apos;re why cavemen chiseled on walls .  .  .

if you &apos;ll excuse me i &apos;m not feeling so well . 
i haven &apos;t been sleeping .  i haven &apos;t been clear or felt like myself .  i &apos;m in trouble .  some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back .  .  .   but the tiredness  -  -  boy .  .  .   not just sleepy . 
i ,  uh .  .  .  i was .  .  .  attacked .  walked in on people robbing me .  i was hospitalized .  i almost died . 
not it at all ,  really . 
what are you talking about ?  you got real problems . 
you know who you want .  i &apos;ll take your seat any day .  so do something .  .  .  don &apos;t sleep on it .  .  .  go over there .  i don &apos;t think anybody should ever sleep on anything  -  -  it &apos;s not always good to let things calm down . 
what &apos;s wrong ? 
nothing .  i just watch till something strikes me .  do anything you think of  -  -  try different thing .  until i say ,   &quot; hold that pose .  &quot;  then just try and comfortably hold it . 
game over ,  bitch ! 
hi .   up ahead my boss is in that black limo .   we &apos;re not sure which hotel we &apos;re at ,  so could you just follow them ? 
good afternoon .   we have reservations at the hotel paraiso in costa blanca .

you want me to pump ? 
why ? 
you don &apos;t know that  -  -  you &apos;re trying to scare me . 
electra . 
yeah . 
it looks like white &apos;s game . 
because that &apos;s how it works .   that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .   he was the best .  he was on top . 
they are very good at what they do .  it &apos;s very seductive .   the training ,  the weapons ,  the travel  -  - 
do you have a passport ? 
it helps me to focus .   it centers me ,  helps me think . 
not even a stalemate ? 
what do you think he &apos;s doing ? 
breakfast . 
where did you learn it ? 
not that i would know ,  but you look like you &apos;re really good at it . 
you &apos;ll be here .   a restaurant .   a public place far enough away that he won &apos;t notice you ,  but with a good enough view you &apos;ll be able to see him when he moves inside . 
i told you ,  he will . 
what is it ?   i don &apos;t like this at all .   what is going on here ? 
they &apos;re worth less points . 
i went into their room this afternoon . 
it was no big deal .   i saw them leave ,  i went in . 
i don &apos;t know .   when i was in college ,  i was forced to go to a psychiatrist because i was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor . 
so i could watch the girl that lived under me . 
it happened to you before ? 
when did it start ? 
i thought it was interesting  -  - 
right .   in my hands i have five back - up disks he made of all of his work last night . 
would you like a drink ? 
why are you working today ? 
that &apos;s okay ,  hon ,  i always expect the unexpected . 
do you think about their wives or their families ? 
do you ever think about starting over ? 
don &apos;t know .   that &apos;s how it works . 
some . 
can i ask you a question ? 
yeah . 
excellent ,  senor .   if you could follow me ? 
he &apos;s not drunk ,  he &apos;s crazy . 
good news comrades ,  it &apos;s better than we &apos;d hoped .  lubosh filled me in on the legal side of squatting here and it &apos;s a piece of cake . 
puppet theatre ,  don &apos;t you need something a little bigger ? 
okay ,  it &apos;s in here somewhere .  let &apos;s keep it quiet . 
no ,  he was talking about girls ,  i think . 
well ,  we might as well start filling it in now .  as long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe  -  so i can get to it ,  we &apos;re set .  use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space  -  we &apos;ll neaten it up later . 
well ,  don &apos;t get carried away . 
i &apos;m an idiot ? 
oh yeah ,  what &apos;s my connection to that ? 
moved on to plumbing huh ? 
i thought you were gonna throw these ? 
nope . 
like helping a sick kid ? 
close !

let &apos;s split . 
why don &apos;t we just take the whole damn building ,  brick by brick doug . 
do you think anyone will really come here ? 
a fine specimen for conversion . 
take the drill back to honza at the office ,  i promised to get it back for the weekend and i don &apos;t want to show my face there . 
it was all in czech wasn &apos;t it . 
what do you want me to do ? 
if i cut a deal ,  i &apos;m not staying in this country and i want holly to come with me .  so ,  if she doesn &apos;t come here today ,  you &apos;re going to have to get her to me tomorrow; after i call ,  promise ? 
i don &apos;t know what it is with you bloody hooligans .  not content with causing trouble back home ,  you idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of europe .  and when finally ,  the police do catch up with you ,  you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out ,  well not this time ,  i &apos;m sorry . 
now ,  have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges ? 
hey ,  lawrence how are you doing mate ? 
a word of advice my celibate friend .  these czech girls look like dynamite and go like it ,  but don &apos;t be fooled; there &apos;s a price to be paid and it &apos;s going up fast .  right kat ? 
i &apos;m not going in doug .  i &apos;ll wait for you here . 
i hope you &apos;re going to invite me in ? 
i could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but i waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs . 
there &apos;s three thousand crowns ,  it &apos;s all i got . 
look ,  if you can get them to finish it by friday ,  you and your friends can do the opening performance that night . 
tomorrow ,  we will bring some lights and also hang some fabric .  i think it will be finished in the morning .

a kiss under the misteltoe .  mistletoe can be deadly ,  if you eat it  .  .  . 
i think you &apos;re jealous that i &apos;m a genuine freak ,  and you have to wear a mask ! 
we &apos;ve met . 
i don &apos;t see how  .  .  .  anyway ,  it &apos;s a treat to find you out in the world ,  away from ebeneezer shreck .

what is it ? 
i &apos;m on break from - 
their new computer sciences division .   how did you know ? 
i started racing after my parents died .   there was something about the speed ,  the danger ,  that took me out of myself ,  that made the hurt go away .   you wouldn &apos;t understand . 
street racing isn &apos;t exactly an acceptable major at oxbridge .   they kicked me out .   it doesn &apos;t matter .  i &apos;ve won enough money to do what i &apos;ve always dreamed . 
paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes ,  you call that family ? 
after you have frozen ,  your icy tomb will plummet back to gotham . 
nice suit .   and today you are ? 
of course .   he &apos;s going to steal the giant white diamond . 
watch the first step . 
remember the victim at the airport .  toxins introduced through the mouth . 
tell me ,  billionaire ,  would you warm faster to my pleas if i looked more like ms .  january here ? 
who &apos;s ivy ? 
make a choice ,  bruce .   her or me . 
i got the diamond .   quell problemo ,  bruce ? 
of course .   alfred still keeps your mother &apos;s picture in his room . 
he &apos;s dying .   and i can &apos;t deal with it . 
hail the all - knowing bruce wayne .  here &apos;s what i know ,  she loves me ,  not you and it &apos;s driving you crazy .  it &apos;s why you stopped us from kissing .  because if you can &apos;t have her ,  nobody can . 
an enticing offer .   but what does the lady want in return ? 
i love that belt .   what are you ,  about a fifty big and tall ? 
in my weakened state i am no match for the bat and the bird . 
you will rescue my wife
make yourself right at home . 
prepare for a bitter harvest .  winter has come at last . 
what say we turn up the heat ? 
forget your frosty femme .   these lips are wet and ready to get frostbite . 
how about dangerous curves ? 
what do we have here ?   a lovely new supply of venom .   i &apos;ll just take this to my laboratory for further study . 
the dreams again ,  sir ? 
 .  .  . the night batman was born .   what was i doing in the fields that night ,  alfred ?  what sent me running out into that storm ?  i keep dreaming about it but i just can &apos;t remember . 
old habits die hard .  are you alright ? 
i &apos;m batman ?  i remember my life as bruce wayne .   but all this .  it &apos;s like the life of a stranger . 
 .  .  . a bat . 
master ,  bruce ? 
all except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of .  but it hasn &apos;t yet been tested . 
 .  .  . dual personalities .  abnormal psychology .  washington &apos;s poster child for the criminally insane .  i read your work . 
why &apos;s that ? 
help chase .  i &apos;ll be back . 
death .   death .  without taste ,  sound and all around us .   because there is no way for me to save them or myself .  this is one giant death trap . 
i see without seeing .  to me ,  darkness is as clear as daylight .  what am i ? 
mr .  nygma ,  you &apos;ll forgive me for being rude .  but what exactly is on your mind ? 
still play with dolls ,  doctor ? 
what do you know about obsession ? 
to kill me . 
i &apos;m surprised you aren &apos;t blind by now . 
me ?  i &apos;m easy .  especially after a couple of martinis . 
look ,  i &apos;m rock climbing sunday .  how about coming along ? 
oh god ,  bruce .  you &apos;re still jealous . 
your memories are repressed .  they &apos;re trying to break through .  relax .  try to remember -  . 
i don &apos;t -  . 
listen ,  dick .  killing two - face won &apos;t take the pain away .  it &apos;ll make it worse . 
back off ,  man . 
but what about all the good we can do ?  there are monsters out there .  gotham needs us . 
exactly .  and once you &apos;d killed him you &apos;d be lost .  like me .   all this has to be a choice .  otherwise .  .  . it &apos;s a curse . 
chase ? 
it &apos;s dr .  meridian .  chase .  do you remember me ? 
wait !  you said you &apos;d let me go ! 
how &apos;d you find us ? 
you know ,  if you cut your bathroom in half ,  you &apos;d have my apartment . 
i know the feeling .  it won &apos;t last .   he &apos;s a long way ahead of where i was at his age . 
how much do you weigh ? 
i &apos;ll have to ask you for that film . 
they don &apos;t come down here .  they &apos;re afraid of the lights . 
they &apos;ve got it all wrong .  they &apos;re watching the warehouses ,  the loading docks ,  looking for a tamperer .  the joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source . 
i just can &apos;t absorb it all .  this place ,  the equipment .  what it must have cost .   why all the secrecy ?  why do you wear the mask ? 
great .   give me a grant . 
 &quot; this is miss vale .  &quot;   -  -  that felt redundant . 
that &apos;s how it is ,  chum .  one column  -  and i can bring all this tumbling down .  i can take you off the streets for good . 
do you want a drink ? 
do you sail ? 
i &apos;m sorry ,  bruce ,  i just can &apos;t seem to get a handle on this conversation . 
i know it &apos;s late .  i  -  -  are you there ? 
i &apos;m sorry i had to stand you up today .  i &apos;d like to make it up to you . 
it &apos;s like the last time .  he sent me a present before he  -  - 
how can you do that if she &apos;s already off the line ? 
i answer to grissom ,  punk .   not to you . 
there was no blood ,  man .   my brother says .  .  .  all the bad things you done .  .  .  they come back and haunt you .  .  . 
jack ,  listen  -  -  we &apos;ll cut a deal  -  - 
i &apos;ve seen worse .   much worse . 
oh ,  it &apos;s too good .   we got a six - foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers . 
where does one man get all this junk ? 
guess who &apos;s got a date with bruce wayne ? 
peanuts ? 
nice snap ,  huh ?   pulitzer prize ,  1963 . 
shut up ,  kevin .   honey ,  you - re not making sense  .  .  .

oh jesus .   oh god .   oh jesus god .   oh mary mother of jesus .  oh jesus of nazareth . 
he &apos;s a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century . 
tomorrow .   you have a problem with that ? 
no ! 
all the guys they claim are english to and good - looking like dan day -  lewis and liam neeson ,  turn out to be irish .   even anthony hopkins is welsh .   prince charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors . 
welsh .

adam my booyy !   when you &apos;re really rich in what matters .  .  .    .  .  .  nothing matters !   my buyer has just made a killing in condos in the village .   and he &apos;s got a little stress problem .  .  .    .  .  .  so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet ! 
jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family . 
cabin fever ,  hon ? 
god ,  it &apos;s jane butterfield ! 
she can &apos;t see you ,  right ?   in the book ,  rule number two :  the living usually won &apos;t see the dead . 
i guess .  .  .  if i &apos;m going to be dead ,  i &apos;ll just have to be the best dead person ever ! 
oh ,  adam ,  don &apos;t ever leave me alone . 
we &apos;re trapped in this house forever .  .  .  with those .  .  .  people . 
that little girl saw us . 
god ,  this is so corny .   have we been reduced to this ?   sheets ? 
well ,  i don &apos;t know .  .  .  we don &apos;t get many visitors . 
honey ,  i think that was a mistake . 
adam< / u> !   why did you build a whorehouse ?   have you ever been to .  .  .  ? 
aren &apos;t you scared ? 
did you get the paint ? 
okay .   but that betelgeuse sure seemed mad . 
are you available ? 
hell is other people .   you obviously don &apos;t read much .  besides things seem pretty quiet here .   you should thank god you didn &apos;t die in italy .   the deetzes .   okay .   have you been studying the manual ? 
i heard .   tore your face right off !   bad news .   it obviously doesn &apos;t do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can &apos;t see you . 
don &apos;t say his name< / u> !   just practice .  do it yourself< / u> ! 
just one daughter . 
folks ,  be reasonable here .   i &apos;m at your service .   you be the judge .  i &apos;m a harmless guy .   try me . 
yes .   i evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed ,  deserved ,  and available .

sort of .   high spirit .   heh heh .  listen ,  cookie ,  i &apos;ve been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years .   all i want is to get out . 
breakfast beetle ?   beetle ?   beetle fruit ?   fruit bat ?   fruit battle ?  volkswagen ?   fruit wagon ? 
can you help me< / u> ? 
otho ? 
lydia ,  at your age ,  you are so< / u> young< / u> .   charles ,  we need to call that awful jane butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door .   can &apos;t you find a way to hold back some of her commission ? 
i feel like we &apos;ve been at war ,  charles . 
stepmother &apos;s .  .  . 
i plan to have a stroke from the amount of msg that &apos;s in this food . 
lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon . 
all right ,  you dead people !   come on out ,  or we &apos;ll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with ! 
i have a feeling there &apos;s some very interesting space behind this door . 
it does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts  -  -  that they actually appear in sheets< / u> ! 
are they still here ,  otho ? 
are we going to be seeing you at miss shannon &apos;s boarding school ? 
otho ,  that &apos;s terrible . 
thomas ?  who &apos;s thomas ? 
then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys ? 
 .  .  .  and please call me robert . 
 .  .  .  were you going somewhere ? 
 .  .  .  he &apos;s gone ,  chauncey . 
eve is going to stay .  the house will not be closed . 
and you ,  benjamin ,  must be strong and brave for me .  turn over ,  please . 
another thing that baffles me ,  doctor  -  what was his connection with the deceased ?  major financial dealings ,  obviously  -  but our firm has no record of any such transactions . 
of course ,  doctor ,  i understand . 
mr .  gardiner ,  i have a telephone call for you .  sidney courtney ,  the financial editor of the washington post . 
 .  .  .  won &apos;t you let us do something for you ?  your leg should be examined ,  we could take you to a hospital . 
i hope you &apos;re comfortable . 
oh ,  i know exactly what you mean .  i sometimes enjoy puttering around myself ,  such a pleasant way to forget one &apos;s troubles . 
 .  .  .  why .  .  .  no ,  i don &apos;t think so .  .  . 
was he a relative ?  or an intimate friend ? 
oh ,  i like that very much . 
chauncey ,  i just wanted to wish you well .  i know you &apos;ll be smashing . 
 .  .  .  i &apos;m grateful to you ,  chauncey .  .  .  i would have opened to you with a touch ,  and you know that .  .  .    .  .  .  but you &apos;re so strong  -  i can trust myself with you .  i &apos;m glad ,  chauncey  -  i &apos;m glad that you showed so much restraint .  .  . 
upstairs ?  chauncey ,  you &apos;re always involved in some sort of discussion .  .  . 
 .  .  .  come in ,  chauncey  -  please come in .  .  . 
dearest ,  you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me ,  and when you watch me my passion dissolves it .  you set me free .  i reveal myself to myself and i am drenched and purged . 
chauncey !  chauncey ! 
good ,  sir .  and so ,  it seems ,  did the president  -  but we would like to have some facts; such as ,  uh .  .  .  what exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the first american financial corporation ? 
of course .  but since he is ill i &apos;m taking the liberty of asking you . 
can you see well ? 
do you need a doctor ?  i could call robert .  .  . 
yes .  tell me ,  mr .  gardiner  -  do you by any chance enjoy krylov &apos;s fables ?  i ask this because there is something .  .  .  there is something krylovian about you . 
so you know your krylov in russian ,  do you ?  mr .  gardiner ,  i must confess i had suspected as much all along  -  i know an educated man when i meet one ! 
no ,  thank you .  my house has been closed . 
i could give it some thought ,  ben ,  but my leg is very sore . 
yes ,  when i was younger i had thoughts about public office .  .  .  but i found ,  chauncey  -  that i was able to contribute more as a private citizen .  .  .  of course ,  my wealth provided me with considerable influence ,  but i &apos;ve tried ,  believe me ,  not to misuse that power .  .  .  it &apos;s extremely important ,  chauncey ,  when one is in a position of eminence ,  that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country .  .  .  the temptations are strong ,  and i &apos;ve been labeled a  &apos;kingmaker &apos; by many ,  but i have tried to stay open to voices of the people .  .  .  i have tried to remain honest to myself .  .  . 
i think what my most insightful friend is saying ,  mr .  president ,  is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature ,  yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy . 
he &apos;s a decent fellow ,  the president ,  isn &apos;t he ? 
she cares for you and she needs your help ,  chauncey .  .  .  there &apos;s much to be looked after .  .  . 
 .  .  .  then you really are a gardener ? 
let &apos;s have a look ,  do you mind ? 
i assure you ,  sir ,  david is a very careful driver .  please ,  won &apos;t you let us take you ? 
how long do we stay in here ? 
 .  .  .  hmmm .  .  .  elevator . 
well ,  ain &apos;t that the truth .  .  . 
oh ,  lord ,  chance  -  i don &apos;t know what i was expectin &apos; from you .  .  .  i &apos;m sorry for yellin &apos; like i did .  .  .  no sir ,  i just don &apos;t know what i was expectin &apos;  .  .  .    .  .  .  i  &apos;spose i &apos;d better gather up some breakfast for you .  .  . 
well ,  no more stewin &apos; those prunes every mornin &apos; ,  that &apos;s somethin &apos; ,  i guess .  .  .    .  .  .  what are you goin &apos; to do now ,  chance ? 
i &apos;m sorry to say that our time is running short ,  but before we close ,  i &apos;d like to ask one final question .  what sort of gardener ,  sir ,  would you be ? 
louise ?  .  .  .  the maid ?  .  .  .   but she should have left earlier today .  .  . 
come now ,  mr .  jennings had been bedridden for thirty - five years ,  since he fractured his spine . 
i have no claim ,  thomas . 
oh ,  ben  -  i miss you so when i &apos;m out .  .  .  how are you feeling ? 
do you feel well enough for that ? 
i &apos;m becoming quite attached to chauncey  -  quite attached .  .  .    .  .  .  and so are you ,  aren &apos;t you ,  eve . 
 .  .  .  is it me ?  is there something i &apos;ve done ? 
but .  .  .  where was this man gardiner before last week ? 
hmmm .  .  .  take this down .   i want this quote included in the tass coverage;  &apos;chauncey gardiner ,  in an intimate discussion with ambassador skrapinov ,  noted that  &quot; unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other ,  all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes .  &quot;  &apos;
and put it through on a code red  -  i want it as soon as possible . 
i do not want benjamin rand disturbed !  you have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man .  use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of chauncey gardiner ,  if you run into problems ,  alert honeycutt .   i &apos;ll be in the office at seven in the morning and i would like to have it at that time .   i &apos;ve got to take a leak . 
so .  .  .  ?  where the hell is it ? 
we have word that the soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on gardiner &apos;s background .  so far ,  they haven &apos;t come up with a thing  -  what &apos;s more ,  as a result of their eagerness ,  one of their ablest agents blew his cover ,  we have him in custody at this time . 
but we are quite certain ,  comrade ,  that this man gardiner is a leading member of an american elitist faction planning a coup d &apos;etat . 
malkovich .

lots of things .  he &apos;s very well respected .  that jewel thief movie ,  for example .  the point is that this is a very odd thing ,  supernatural ,  for lack of a better word .  it raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self ,  about the existence of the soul .  am i me ?  is malkovich malkovich ?  was the buddha right ,  is duality an illusion ?  do you see what a can of worms this portal is ?  i don &apos;t think i can go on living my life as i have lived it .  there &apos;s only one thing to do .  let &apos;s get married right away . 
you wanted to be partners with me ?

i -  - the royal we ,  you know ,  the editorial -  - i dropped off the money ,  exactly as per -  - look ,  i &apos;ve got certain information ,  certain things have come to light ,  and uh ,  has it ever occurred to you ,  man ,  that given the nature of all this new shit ,  that ,  uh ,  instead of running around blaming me ,  that this whole thing might just be ,  not ,  you know ,  not just such a simple ,  but uh -  - you know ? 
you monsters ! 
yeah ,  but -  - 
you &apos;ve been training two years to take me out .   here i am ,  the big ,  bad vampire hunter .   so do it . 
this is our world you &apos;re entering .   you may see things  -  -  feeding .   just remember why you &apos;re here . 
he &apos;s right about one thing .   we do have to survive . 
blade .   we &apos;ve got six reapers .   they &apos;re all dead . 
blade . 
thank you . 
it would &apos;ve been easy for you to let me die back there today ,  but you didn &apos;t . 
eau de suckhead .   tasty . 
spare me the race card ,  oj .   we &apos;re not going out into the sun .   it &apos;s too risky . 
yes ? 
nobody to call in case of an emergency ? 
tell me something ,  skid  -  - 
going on twenty years now . 
don &apos;t try to talk  -  - 
is something wrong ,  my friend ? 
yes .  the vampire apocalypse .  it is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the thirst . 
i am tired .  dawn is coming . 
but ,  he could &apos;ve  -  - 
look ,  if what you say is true ,  if there &apos;s a chance i could turn into one of them ,  then i &apos;ve got no choice ,  do i ?  i have to work with you .  i need to learn everything i can about them .  it &apos;s the only way i &apos;ll be able to find a cure for myself . 
so many of them  -  -  i still can &apos;t believe they &apos;re real . 
you &apos;re hurt  -  - 
is it bad ? 
it won &apos;t work on you . 
 -  -  tearing me  -  -  apart . 
how could you be a part of this ? 
the red blood cells are biconvex ,  which is theoretically impossible .  they &apos;re hypochromic ,  there &apos;s virtually no hemoglobin in them .   look at the pmns ,  they &apos;re binucleated ,  they should be mononucleated . 
the shadows suit us ,  frost .  we &apos;ve existed this way for thousands of years .  who are you to challenge our ways ? 
these archives are restricted to members of the house of erebus . 
you &apos;re wasting your time ,  frost .  far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words .  whatever secrets they hold have been lost . 
how many of you are there ? 
so what do you use ,  then ?  a stake ? 
whistler ! 
how did you escape ? 
 -  - and if she ever did -  - 
you killed domini ,  didn &apos;t you ,  witch ?  ? 
something was wrong . 
what &apos;s she look like ? 
 -  - myth< / u> -  - 
 -  - chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents .  it &apos;s called vandalism . 
no offense ,  sweetheart :  fuck you . 
your body ,  your call . 
what ? 
and what do you possibly think you &apos;re going to fucking see there ? 
i think we get the gist . 
what can i get you ? 
what &apos;d you dream ? 
then i &apos;m going -  - 
are you marked like this ?  ? 
 -  - like you hurt the baby -  - 
one< / u> set .  everything from midnight on -  - 
i don &apos;t know yet . 
never would &apos;ve guessed . 
what movies ? 
no fucking . 
whatta you got ,  telescopic vision ? 
where is< / u> it ? 
fire escape ?  ? 
where ? 
 -  - into the black< / u> hills< / u> with -  - 200 -  something miles from here -  - 
nobody &apos;s going anywhere -  - 
this is her equally on - the - rag boy -  friend ,  nick leavitt -  - 
 -  - they &apos;re from umass ,  doing some kind of fucking term paper -  - 
we &apos;re not making blair witch ii here . 
okay ,  but -  - 
what< / u> ? 
 -  - what happened to the goddamn  &quot; witch - watch ?  ?  &quot; 
there &apos;s four other angles ,  man ,  we haven &apos;t even -  - 
chrissake :  why any< / u> of this ? 
why was she< / u> exempted ,  nick ? 
 -  - sacred and occult scotch tape . 
that &apos;s almost a year &apos;s worth of work !   scumbags !  oh ,  jesus ,  jesus .  .  .  . 
what ? 
that &apos;d be up on your shoulder ,  maybe your lower back . 
for a blur ? 
what is it you thought you saw on that tape ? 
dad .  .  .  ? 
no big deal .  i &apos;m just trying to understand . 
 -  - bullshit -  - 
why in the world would she< / u> -  - 
put  &apos;em together that &apos;s a  &quot; k .  &quot;  james kurth -  - 
could i tell him what it &apos;s regarding ? 
what was that ? 
why d &apos;you wanna leave all this ? 
 .  .  . i can find a place tomorrow ,  then i &apos;ll be outta your hair . 
 .  .  . he sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some . 
nothing .  he &apos;s like you ,  he doesn &apos;t say much . 
 .  .  . but first i gotta know what happened . 
you won &apos;t have to .  i &apos;ll explain what a palate is . 
sure don &apos;t . 
 .  .  . what was that back there ? 
yeah . 
then what &apos;d you come here for ? 
 .  .  . you get a refund though ,  if you tell me who else she &apos;s been sluicing .

this . 
the point is we don &apos;t serve niggers here . 
thanks meurice . 
 .  .  . and abby .  maybe .  but as far as i &apos;m concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility . 
he &apos;s alright ,  i guess .  i hope .  they &apos;re doing tests ,  that &apos;s why i &apos;m home from school .  i was over at the hospital this morning and i was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood .  there behind vista ,  i found an ear . 
jeffrey ? 
these are beautiful .  how &apos;s the case coming ? 
anything you can tell me ? 
is sandy part of this ? 
because of your information i alerted internal affairs to check out detective gordon .   i had to keep on with him as if nothing was different .   he slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid frank &apos;s place . 
bull . 
yes ?  what is it ? 
jeffrey .  jeffrey what ? 
that &apos;s right .  that &apos;s what i said .  you have a good memory .  then what ? 
how many times have you sneaked into girls &apos; apartments and watched them undress ? 
how &apos;d you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you .   get undressed .  i want to see you . 
don ? 
yes . 
do you like me ? 
go then .  i can &apos;t let you put it in me now but i want you .  i like you .

oh yeah .  what about those other people ?   .  anything ?

it wouldn &apos;t hurt to hear the plan ,  i guess . 
okay ,  i &apos;m going ahead .  wait a minute ,  what &apos;s her name ? 
are you alright ? 
yeah ,  if it opens the door .

i &apos;m married ,  george .   me .   i can &apos;t believe it .   can you believe i &apos;m married ,  george ? 
no ,  i never .   i would not do that ,  george .   never . 
in how long ?   a week ? 
yeah ,  layaway . 
thank you .   have you been getting the money i sent you ? 
mirtha comes from a very wealthy family . 
i like you ,  george .   you are loyal .  that is good .   that is rare .   maybe crazy .   yes .   i can tell already .   you are like me .   i look at you and i see myself .   it &apos;s in the eyes ,  no ,  george ? 
freedom . 
yeah ,  maybe . 
money .

hi . 
i meant every word of it . 
george .

source ?   what about derek ? 
no ,  that &apos;s alright . 
hey ,  george .   you okay ? 
i don &apos;t want ,  alright ?   it &apos;s not funny .  i &apos;m really pissed off ,  george .   you blew it ,  now leave me alone . 
i &apos;m thinking about getting out of town this week .   you want to come with me ? 
there &apos;s schools in california . 
that &apos;s right .   three o &apos;clock .   thursday .  at your mother &apos;s .   you and me .   it &apos;s a date . 
but i want to put her name on the list for tomorrow .   my daughter . 
because she &apos;s visiting me . 
do you see him here in the courtroom ? 
for instance ,  something like this ? 
good to see you ,  jorge .   you are a man of your word . 
the questions have already been asked .  i would only like some precise answers ,  that &apos;s all  .  .  . 
which  &quot; district &quot;  do you belong to ? 
you afraid of these  .  .  .  ? 
why are you afraid ?  we &apos;ve always been friends .  one might even say that i brought you up  .  .  .  isn &apos;t it true ,  ali ? 
you still haven &apos;t told me why you didn &apos;t let me kill him . 
because they told us that we mustn &apos;t use weapons ,  now ,  when the time is right . 
good evening  .  .  .  can we pass ? 
please ,  we just want to take a short ride .  a friend of mine has never seen the casbah . 
and so the tapeworm no longer has a head .  are you satisfied ,  mathieu ?  in algiers everything should be over . 
okay .  but we want your promise for a fair trial in writing .  give us a written statement ,  mathieu ,  and then we &apos;ll surrender . 
how you doin &apos; mister d ? 
i would have missed it  -  -  but the phone rang and i let it play while i talked .   it looks like blank tape  -  -  but it isn &apos;t .   it &apos;s been erased without any input signal coming in . 
i &apos;m sorry to barge in  -  -  but i figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news ? 
what was mr .  marsh &apos;s physical condition prior to his death ? 
your honor ,  the state enters this evidence as exhibit a .   were any fingerprints found on the bottle ? 
can you ? 
suspicions maybe  -  -  but suspicions aren &apos;t enough for a conviction . 
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . 
objection !   may i remind mr .  dulaney that the person on trial here is miss lawson  -  -  not dr .  paley . 
were you aware of mr .  marsh &apos;s heart condition ? 
did you talk about miss lawson ? 
what happened next ? 
and how are you now ? 
she told me that tonight we were going to open new doors .   i asked her to stop  -  -  to take off the handcuffs ,  but she wouldn &apos;t listen . 
what did she do next ,  mr .  roston ? 
if you knew it was bad for you why did you do it ? 
did you suggest any ? 
 -  -  and what did you suggest ? 
dr .  trammel ,  did you ever speak to miss lawson about mr .  marsh &apos;s condition ? 
did mr .  marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to miss lawson about his illness ? 
then you have no way of knowing what mr .  marsh told miss lawson were the reasons for his visits ? 
did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps ? 
no . 
miss sellers ,  do you know dr .  alan paley ? 
then what happened ? 
i take it you don &apos;t like miss lawson very much ? 
could you repeat the last part of what mr .  marsh said to you the day before his death ? 
yes ,  i slept with him but that was a long time ago . 
i &apos;ve tried it . 
yes . 
isn &apos;t it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought ? 
what do you have in your purse ? 
he &apos;ll file .   he &apos;s an ambitious man .  ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others . 
frank ! 
hi ,  frank . 
it &apos;s going to be hard to convince a jury that he &apos;s testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off . 
there &apos;s nothing wrong in admitting that you want me ,  frank . 
alone ? 
you were brilliant today . 
rebecca  -  -  take these off . 
rebecca  -  -  we shattered a man &apos;s life in open court . 
so ,  sue me .   things have changed .   i think you should go home  -  -  and after you leave i see no reason for us to ever have contact again . 
alright ,  i &apos;ll talk to her
i know what day it is !   get off the phone . 
do it quickly ,  mr .  dulaney . 
but your honor -  - 
miss braslow ,  i &apos;d like to remind you that you are still under oath . 
i can back it up . 
can &apos;t it wait ? 
i know .   what can i do ?   he is the boss . 
what &apos;s wrong ? 
i was thinking that when the trial is over we &apos;d all go skiing for a weekend . 
please  -  -  not now . 
you think that &apos;s the answer ?   sex ?  is that what you want ?   you want me to make love to you ? 
albert &apos;s got the stomach flu . 
no ,  it &apos;s not .   now i get to pitch . 
let me go !   godammit ,  frank let go ! 
it &apos;s a beautiful picture of her . 
oh ,  just a old letter from a friend . 
my lord .  it must feel real nice living inside your head with peter pan and the easter bunny . 
don &apos;t say that ! 
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s making jokes . 
nobody did . 
only about a thousand times .  what do i do now ?   &quot; what &apos;s good enough for mom is good enough for me ?  &quot; 
roseman bridge ? 
if i &apos;m not taking you away from anything . 
well ,  thank you for all your help ,  mrs .  johnson . 
sure you want to keep those in the house ? 
where are you staying while you &apos;re here ? 
i better go .  you sure you &apos;re all right ?   it &apos;s been a pleasure .  sincerely . 
are you all right ? 
you must get lonely at times . 
but  -  -  how can you just live for what you want ?  what about other people ? 
just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn &apos;t necessarily mean they &apos;re hypnotized .  just because i &apos;ve never seen a gazelle stampede doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m asleep in the world . 
my mistake .  i apologize . 
i thought that &apos;s what we were doing  -  -  asking questions . 
am i interrupting anything ? 
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t call sooner ,  but i just read your note .  i stuffed it into my pocket .  the light was fading and i had to get my shot . 
i would love to come for dinner . 
are you comfortable ?   do you .  .  .  want to move to the bedroom ? 
where ?  near the doorway or the near the front of the church ? 
i bet you could do a book . 
i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m so tired all of a sudden . 
well ,  why is that up to me ?  you &apos;re the one who &apos;s married .  you told me you have no intention of leaving your husband . 
how do you know what i experience ? 
i don &apos;t want to need you ! 
his family &apos;s lived for almost a hundred years .  richard doesn &apos;t know how to live anywhere else .  and the kids .  .  . 
no matter how much distance we put between us and this house ,  i bring with it with me .  and i &apos;ll feel it every minute we &apos;re together .  and i &apos;ll blame loving you for how much it hurts .  and then even these four days won &apos;t be anything more than something sordid and .  .  .  a mistake . 
no .  don &apos;t do this .

the only time i was at the tangiers was when i had dinner with barney greenstein . 
you were wandering around . 
as far as the world was concerned andy stone ,  the head of the teamsters &apos; pension fund ,  was a legitimate guy . 
a powerful man . 
he even played golf with the president . 
first of all ,  what they did was totally unconstitutional .  we &apos;re already on the list to be heard before the supreme court of the united states later this year .

he wants a fifty - thousand marker . 
within no time ,  everything was set in place .  we got rid of the freelance scamsters .  the per was way up .   the gods were happy ,  or as happy as the gods can ever be .   and i ,  i decided to complicate my life .  for a guy who likes sure things ,  i was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot . 
you don &apos;t know me .  what ,  you &apos;ve known me ,  two ,  three months .  what do you know ?

 &quot; save the city ?  &quot;  i don &apos;t want to save the city ,  i want to move !   listen ,  i &apos;m sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and i can &apos;t thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie ,  but .  .

i never thanked you .  . the arrow .  . the motorcycle .  . the computer disc .  . you &apos;re so different from what i .  . and so the same . 
what are you doing on theo &apos;s line ? 
he ran out on me to be with you ?  well fuck him !   everything worked twice as good without him .   we didn &apos;t need him then and i don &apos;t need him now . 
so what ?   what could be important enough to put your hands on me ? 
i &apos;m trying to help somebody .  okay ? 
what &apos;d you do ?   tail me from brentwood ? 
nels reporting in .   sit down where you are .   arms folded . 
you switched license plates ? 
i don &apos;t like anybody laying their hands on me . 
and stop with the directions . 
we &apos;ve had our share of fuck - ups but it &apos;s going to work out fine . 
well i &apos;m not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when i &apos;m about to make the most important score of my life .   this has gotta be some  &quot; put - on ,  &quot;  right ? 
okay .   the police are gonna need your full name and address . 
the cops could trace this call back to you . 
he &apos;s right .   you &apos;ll get my whole family killed . 
i didn &apos;t mean to .   it &apos;s just the way i am . 
i wasn &apos;t always like that .   i don &apos;t think i was . 
lenore ,  i &apos;m here .   i &apos;m getting out . 
don &apos;t say anything .   don &apos;t alarm them .   just go ! 
i might still get there first .  the lights are with me .   how would i identify the guy who shows up at the bank ? 
i &apos;ve got a lot of respect for you too .   for the way you feel about your family . 
yes ?   yes ? 
sit completely still with both hands on the wheel  -  -  until they get here . 
not all .   they already have a third .   the question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back ? 
we might hit a bump and the gun might go off .   ever see that tarantino movie  -  -  where travolta blew that guy away in the back seat  -  -  purely by accident ? 
you were at the emerald that night ? 
who &apos;d ever think ,  to look at you ? 
what &apos;s really on your wicked little mind ? 
who are you working for ? 
you can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land jack there in federal prison .   he can &apos;t afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence . 
she &apos;s somewhat damaged in the shipping .   but nothing makeup won &apos;t cover . 
i &apos;m here .   where are you ? 
her husband said there &apos;d be one million eight .   so nine hundred to you . 
be careful in disposing of them .  you &apos;ll have to discount  &apos;em .  you &apos;ll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter . 
and then ? 
what &apos;s he doing ?   answer me ! 
you &apos;re going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked . 
yeah ? 
why would she want me to think you were on ice ? 
i can see the benefit in that . 
i already called for an ambulance . 
so can we consider you a regular ,  sir ? 
she wants me to tell you go fuck yourself . 
he gave me a look . 
look ,  i &apos;m sorry .

yes  -  -  that all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he &apos;s in business . 
you &apos;re charles voss &apos;s wife  -  -  now that he &apos;s dead you &apos;re their only lead .

because he &apos;s wearing moccasins .

then these are all new owners ? 
but that means that most of the valley &apos;s been sold in the last few months . 
well ,  then ,  how about a ruler ? 
lou escobar  he &apos;s a lieutenant . 
far as it goes .  of course he has to swim in the same water we all do . 
too bad ? 
if you want an answer to that question i can always put one of my men on the job .  good afternoon ,  mr .  cross . 
is she all right ? 
an obituary column .  .  .  can you read in this light ? 
and that &apos;s what you were going to do in the valley ? 
there &apos;s going to be some irate citizens when they find out they &apos;re paying for water they &apos;re not getting . 
i want to know what you &apos;re worth .  over ten million ? 
hello . 
i &apos;ll just tell my wife . 
i might be able to squeeze an extra seventy - five bucks out of it for you .  maybe an even hundred . 
then what &apos;ll you do ? 
yes . 
i have a cold i can &apos;t seem to shake but other than that ,  i &apos;m fine . 
or her name ? 
absolutely . 
i want those photographs ,  gittes .  we &apos;re talking about accessory after the fact ,  conspiracy ,  and extortion .  minimum . 
no ,  gittes ,  you &apos;ll show us . 
give you three minutes . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  mrs .  mulwray . 
no . 
a complete surprise ? 
mr .  gittes . 
i think so .  something besides your husband &apos;s death was bothering you .  you were upset but not that upset . 
another satisfied client ? 
whoever &apos;s behind my husband &apos;s death ,  why have they gone to all this trouble ? 
know him ? 
there was a memorial service at the mar vista inn today for jasper lamar crabb .  he died three weeks ago . 
i &apos;ll stay . 
what do you mean ,   &apos;why ?  &apos; nobody &apos;s here ,  that &apos;s all . 
when was the last time ? 
i know . 
you know what i mean .  you &apos;re keeping her there against her will . 
she &apos;s too upset . 
just tell me the truth .  i &apos;m not the police .  i don &apos;t care what you &apos;ve done .  i &apos;m not going to hurt you ,  but one way or another i &apos;m going to know . 
don &apos;t worry .  i can recommend a couple .  they &apos;re expensive but you can afford it . 
yes positively .  that &apos;s where he was drowned .  .  . 
stop it !   i &apos;ll make it easy .  you were jealous ,  you fought ,  he fell ,  hit his head .  it was an accident ,  but his girl is a witness .  you &apos;ve had to pay her off .  you don &apos;t have the stomach to harm her ,  but you &apos;ve got the money to shut her up .  yes or no ? 
 .  .  . he had a breakdown .  .  .  the dam broke .  .  .  my mother died .  .  .  he became a little boy .  .  .  i was fifteen .  .  .  he &apos;d ask me what to eat for breakfast ,  what clothes to wear !  .  .  .  it happened .  .  .  then i ran away .  .  . 
walsh here ? 
where &apos;d he go yesterday ? 
 .  .  . why don &apos;t you give me your address and we can talk this over ? 
you ought to be more careful .  that must really smart . 
i don &apos;t understand . 
wait .  please sit down ,  mr .  gittes .  we &apos;re .  .  .  well ,  we &apos;re not anxious for this to get around ,  but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley .  as you know ,  the farmers there have no legal right to our water ,  and since the drought we &apos;ve had to cut them off .  the city comes first ,  naturally .   but ,  well ,  we &apos;ve been trying to help some of them out ,  keep them from going under .  naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff . 
hard working ,  have a wife and kids .  .  . 
when it comes . 
jake ,  what &apos;re you doin &apos; here ? 
yeah ?  ain &apos;t that something ?  middle of a drought ,  the water commissioner drowns .  only in l . a . 
that &apos;s a long fall . 
it &apos;s bone dry ,  morty . 
gittes ?  .  .  .  gittes ? 
all right ,  what &apos;s your husband &apos;s first name ? 
city of la habra heights filled an 800 , 000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days . 
he owned the water department ? 
he owned the entire water supply for the city ? 
they were partners . 
neither do i . 
not exactly . 
you must not come here !  how many times do i have to tell you ?   if the film catches fire ,  runt that you are ,  you &apos;d go up in a burst of flame .  .  . whoosh !  and turn into a piece of .  .  . 
 &apos;i choose my friends for their looks ,  and my enemies for their brains .  .  .  &apos;  you &apos;re too smart to be my friend .  besides ,  as i always tell my kids ,  be careful to pick the right friends ! 
because i &apos;m an idiot .  how many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist ?  none !  only a jerk like me could do it .  besides i wasn &apos;t lucky .  when i was a kid there was the war !  when i grew up ,  another war !  now it &apos;s all different .  times have changed .  and you want to be a dope like me ?  huh ?  answer me ! 
eh !  love .  .  . what a mystery !   i understand you ,  toto .  .  . the ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful .  whatever you do ,  you can &apos;t make friends with them .   eh ,  there &apos;s nothing to be done about it !  the heavier a man is ,  the deeper his footprints .  and if he &apos;s in love ,  he suffers ,  because he knows he &apos;s up a one - way street .  because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants .  .  .  
he won &apos;t be convinced ,  salvatore .  he has other plans for me . 
daddy &apos;s not coming back .  .  . he &apos;s dead .  
but why do you call me  &apos;mr .  di vita &apos; ?  it didn &apos;t used to be that way .  .  . 
mr .  bernstein ,  mr .  thatcher  - 
that &apos;s all right .   we have no secrets from our readers .   mr .  thatcher is one of our most devoted readers ,  mr .  bernstein .   he knows what &apos;s wrong with every issue since i &apos;ve taken charge .  what &apos;s the cable ? 
he sure did ,  mr .  kane . 
ask them to sit down ,  mr .  bernstein . 
susie ?   i called her myself the day after he died .   i thought maybe somebody ought to .  .  .   she couldn &apos;t even come to the  &apos;phone . 
mr .  bernstein ,  am i a stuffed shirt ?  am i a horse - faced hypocrite ?   am i a new england school - marm ? 
where is it  -  where &apos;s my notice ?  i &apos;ve got to finish it ! 
but a morning newspaper ,  mr .  kane .  after all ,  we &apos;re practically closed twelve hours a day  -  except for the business offices  - 
the nurse has complete instructions ,  but if you care to talk to me at any time ,  i should be only too glad  -   i shall be here in the morning . 
i &apos;m sure that &apos;s it .  
not at all .   i &apos;d like the nurse to be here ,  too . 
how do you do ?   i came here  -  and i made mr .  kane come with me .  .  .   because i recieved this note  - 
emily ,  you &apos;re being  -  a little unfair  -   you know what i think of charles &apos; behavior  -  about your personal lives  - 
i know that ,  emily  - 
what do you expect me to do ?   what in the world  - 
what &apos;s this all about ,  emily ?   i &apos;ve had a very tiring day and  - 
you don &apos;t think i &apos;m going to let this blackmailer intimidate me ,  do you ? 
oh ,  they &apos;ll publish it all right .  but that &apos;s not going to stop me  - 
i suppose so ,  but  -  i &apos;m not afraid of the story .   you can &apos;t tell me that the voters of this state  - 
i can &apos;t tell you the things he said ,  charlie .   you haven &apos;t got any idea  - 
charlie ,  you &apos;re just excited .   you don &apos;t realize  - 
you &apos;ve got some on your face . 
you &apos;re very easily amused . 
no .   that is ,  i bet it turns out i &apos;ve heard your name a million times ,  only you know how it is  - 
how old did you say you were ? 
hurray for the bulldog !   half past eleven !   the shows have just let out .   people are going to night clubs and restaurants .   of course ,  we &apos;re different .   we live in a palace  -  at the end of the world . 
i &apos;m not just your wife ,  i &apos;m a person all by myself  -  or i ought to be .   i was once .   sometimes you get me to believing i never was . 
i &apos;ll discuss what &apos;s on my mind when i want to .   you &apos;re not going to keep on running my life the way you want it . 
don &apos;t you realize that everybody here is going to know about this ?  that you &apos;ve packed your bags and ordered the car and  - 
is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper ? 
 &quot; enemy armada off jersey coast .  &quot;   you know you haven &apos;t the slightest proof that this  -  this armada  -  is off the jersey coast . 
you see !   there hasn &apos;t been a true word  - 
i happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday ,  charles .   could i not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise  -   this enquirer  -  that is costing you one million dollars a year ? 
close the door ,  raymond . 
raymond  -  
yes ,  mr .  kane . 
the  &quot; chronicle &quot;  is a good newspaper . 
well ,  gentlemen ,  are we going to war ? 
say ,  brad .   i &apos;ve got an idea . 
yes ? 
why not ? 
they &apos;re true !   everything i said !  witholding that veto was treason ! 
sure i am .   she wants full custody of the child no matter what happens .  if you won &apos;t agree to that ,  she &apos;ll apply for a divorce regardless of the president &apos;s wishes .   i can &apos;t tell her she &apos;s wrong ,  because she isn &apos;t wrong  - 
she hasn &apos;t any friends left sine you started this oil business ,  and she never sees you . 
she can leave me .   as a matter of fact ,  i &apos;ve already left her .   don &apos;t worry ,  brad  -  i &apos;ll live . 
hello ,  brad . 
i &apos;ll sign those papers  - 
well ,  let &apos;s hope it &apos;s all for the best . 
david ,  grobleski & davis  -   my dear rawlston  -  
on your way out ,  stop at a cigar store ,  will you ,  and send me up a couple of cigars ? 
yeah ,  all in crates . 
i &apos;ll get to it right away ,  mr .  rawlston . 
yes ,  sir  -  yes ,  sir ,  i knew how to handle the old man .   he was kind of queer ,  but i knew how to handle him . 
i didn &apos;t get a thing .   just the music lessons .   that &apos;s all there was to it . 
how long have you been smoking ? 
i &apos;d say you &apos;re about nineteen ,  twenty ,  am i right ? 
unnhh ! 
hey ,  now wait a sec .  .  . 
you &apos;d think she was marrying him .  what are you watching ? 
a woman &apos;s intuition .  something in me says it &apos;s time to give the old boy a serious try . 
god ,  isn &apos;t he great ? 
i would &apos;ve told you ,  and you would have stopped calling ,  like a baby . 
no ,  i wasn &apos;t .  not really .  i told you &apos;d i &apos;d been seeing other people . 
i &apos;m giving him his ring back . 
good .  stay in that frame of mind . 
the key word here is talk ,  dante .  i think the idea ,  the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date . 
i can &apos;t believe this !  i feel faint .  .  . 
wait a second ?  who was working here today ? 
that &apos;s easy to say from over here . 
well ,  he missed ! 
you open ? 
what am i worried about ?   he &apos;ll probably be glad i started the ball rolling .  all he ever did was complain about her anyway .  i &apos;m just looking out for his best interests .   i mean ,  that &apos;s what a friend does ,  am i right ?  i did him a favor . 
she called me . 
great story ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
interesting postscript to that story :  do you know who wound up going with brad michaelson in the other dark bedroom ? 
all four ? 
what &apos;s that ? 
i guess . 
yeah . 
it would stand to reason ,  yes . 
you know what else i noticed in jedi ? 
and the second one was still being built when they blew it up . 
so when they blew it up ,  no prob .  evil is punished . 
why doesn &apos;t he just mix and match ? 
what did he say ? 
what &apos;s a jizz - mopper ? 
there aren &apos;t . 
i heard you apologize .  why ?  you have every right in the world to be mad . 
bitch ,  bitch ,  bitch .  you want something to drink ?  
you know what sanford told me ?  
why not ? 
shit .  what about tomorrow ? 
no ! 
i could never reach . 
yeah .  like you said ,  you know .  i guess everyone tries it ,  sooner of later . 
i can &apos;t fucking believe you !  ! 
what &apos;s that for ? 
so your argument is that title dictates behavior ? 
the reasons you won &apos;t let me borrow your car is because i have a title and a job description ,  and i &apos;m supposed to follow it ,  right ? 
hermaphroditic porn .  starlets with both organs .  you should see the box :  beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame . 
really ? 
holy shit .  that girl ? 
then how come you got the fine ? 
you &apos;re lying . 
you &apos;re happy ? 
what did she say ? 
you &apos;re a snake . 
you want me to bring the vcr over here so we can watch this ? 
maybe the asian design major slipped her some opium ? 
she said she did all the work . 
it is .  you just up and quit .  there are other jobs ,  and they pay better money .  you &apos;re bound to be qualified for at least one of them .  so what &apos;s stopping you ? 
melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement . 
so you &apos;ll continue being miserable all the time ,  just because you don &apos;t have the guts to face change ? 
do i know you ? 
i still remember caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel - the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room . 
yes ,  they are .  you &apos;re out of shape . 
all right .  how much is pepsi here ? 
you used to go out with her ? 
you know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer . 
and he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass .  .  .  ? 
um .  .  .  yeah ,  but it &apos;s for employees only . 
the white kind . 
yeah ,  but .  .  . 
say ,  young fella ,  you know i hate to bother you again ,  but can i take a paper or something back there .  .  .  to read ?   it usually takes me a while ,  and i like to read while it &apos;s going on . 
what were you doing up so late ? 
honesty through paranoia .  why do you smell like shoe polish ? 
oh ,  you think so ? 
i &apos;m insulted .  believe me ,  don juan ,  it takes more than that to get a guy off .  just  &quot; being there &quot;  - as you put it - is not enough . 
i &apos;m astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life . 
why &apos;d you hit me ? 
three ? 
no; who were the three ,  besides me ? 
they put up the least amount of struggle . 
where ? 
sylvan can be talked into anything . 
oh my god !  why did you tell me you only slept with three guys ? 
how many ? 
well .  .  .  ? 
what ?  something like thirty - six ? 
i &apos;m thirty - seven ? 
a few ? 
he still hasn &apos;t shown up .  why aren &apos;t you in class ? 
you had to tell him . 
you hold the counter and i &apos;ll pull . 
i think the lady called it . 
it &apos;s probably from being around all this food every day . 
really ? 
you &apos;ve never heard anybody say anything about either movie ? 
well this is the last time i ever rent here .  .  . 
no ,  i &apos;m more furious .  i &apos;m pissed off .  i feel like he &apos;s been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels ,  and then he can &apos;t even do it !   he has his friend do it for him ! 
i will .  take it easy . 
hey ,  gabe ,  we &apos;re flyin &apos; off the tower today .   c &apos;mon with us . 
jessie !   are you alright ? 
copy .   jessie ,  go to the top of bitker ladder . 
the money ! 
now let me fill you in .   you can get your ass back down an &apos; go back to that hole you been hiding in -  - 
i &apos;m going with you . 
room service .  .  . hi ,  sarah . 
can i count as fast as i like ? 
where &apos;ve you been ? 
you &apos;re saying ,  i don &apos;t understand ?   i &apos;m the only< / u> one who does understand .   i &apos;m the one you lived with for two years ,  i &apos;m the one you made promises to ,  i &apos;m the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all .   believe me ,  there &apos;s been times i didn &apos;t know what i wanted to do more ,  love you or hate you .   but the one thing in our relationship that i did know and still do know is that i understand you< / u> . 
i &apos;m not going to faint ,  but if i want to faint ,  i &apos;ll faint ,  okay ? 
where ? 
and i can &apos;t leave . 
you know where everything is .  .  .   i &apos;m late for my shift . 
man ,  it costs a fortune to heat this place . 
if you &apos;re not using your arm ,  can i borrow it ? 
we might be able to go that way . 
pull it apart ! 
gabe ! 
but maybe with a good start i can hit those hand - holds . 
we don &apos;t have time to argue about it ! 
take the rope . 
wrap it around that rock twice . 
the  &quot; old mouth to mouth &quot;  resuscitation routine . 
where &apos;s the helicopter ? 
tucker ,  you know where the money is -  -  i want it . 
on top of the peak . 
go after her . 
what &apos;s the delay ? 
why ?   what are you going to do ?  ! 
don &apos;t give him anything . 
bring down the money or your friend &apos;s dead ! 
he &apos;s alive ! 
i know who you are !  isn &apos;t it your picture in the newspapers ?  didn &apos;t i see you this morning on the video ?  are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique ? 
it was very kind of you to leave this out for me ,  sir .  there was no - one around when i finished my bath ,  so i started .  i hope that &apos;s alright ,  sir . 
no ,  my health doesn &apos;t allow it . 
but ,  missus ,  this is an emergency .  it &apos;s a matter of life and death .  me friend &apos;s lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death . 
our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not ,  shall we say ,  satisfactory ,  yes ? 
ah ,  alex boy ,  awake at last ,  yes ?  i met your mother on the way to work ,  yes ?  she gave me the key .  she said something about a pain somewhere .  .  .  hence not at school  ,  yes ? 
i &apos;ve just come back from the hospital .  your victim has died . 
so now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence ? 
we got worried .  there we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other ,  so around we come to your abode . 
not tonight  -  not this nochy . 
what crime did you commit . 
thank you very much for this chance ,  sir . 
good evening ,  my boy . 
surprise ? 
hullo lad .  what a surprise ,  good to see you . 
well ,  still the same old place then ,  eh ? 
oh ,  he had a shower this morning .  you trying to call me a liar ? 
oh .  oh ,  you &apos;re sorry are you ,  well you must think i &apos;m awfully stupid .  he slaps alex in the face . 
 .  .  .  and that .  .  .  he pulls alex &apos;s ear ,  pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest . 
yes ,  sir . 
pick that up and put it down properly .  alex does so ,  and continues to empty his pockets . 
do you wear any false teeth or false limbs ? 
fine .  .  .  fine . 
i realise all that ,  missus ,  and i &apos;m very grateful to all concerned . 
oh no ,  nothing of the sort . 
it &apos;s quite simple really .  were just going to show you some films . 
something like that . 
good .  i &apos;m doctor taylor . 
isn &apos;t the plumage beautiful ? 
one thing i could never stand is to see a filthy ,  dirty old drunkie ,  howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp ,  blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts .  i could never stand to see anyone like that ,  whatever his age might be ,  but more especially when he was real old like this one was .  the boys stop and applaud him . 
father ,  i have tried ,  have i not ? 
i don &apos;t understand about the whys and wherefores ,  father .  i only know i want to be good . 
one jacket  -  blue pinstripe . 
moloko - plus .

you dizzy ?   you want to sit down ? 
what kind of question ? 
i know the answer .   i know all there is to know about louis . 
i see .   that was an important list ,  wouldn &apos;t you say ?   the people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge .   and you  &quot; lost &quot;  it ? 
tell me ,  vincent .   do you believe in santa claus ? 
tell me vincent .   tell me what you think . 
 .  .  . goddamn it ,  you telling me this motherfucker &apos;s whacked three of our witnesses tonight .  .  . 
dmitri gusunov ? < / u> what the fuck ,  why ?  forget about dimitri ,  feds are all over him .   they &apos;re a heartbeat away from taking him down .   word &apos;s gone out ,  they don &apos;t want us anywhere near him .  .  .

what holds you back ,  max ?   tell me .  why does life scare you so much ? 
good .   blood ,  urine and death get to you ?  try deep breathing .   or remember we all die anyway .  .  . 
you &apos;re too good .   we &apos;re in this together .   fates intertwined .   cosmic coincidence and all that crap .  .  . 
i &apos;m< / u> full of shit ?   you &apos;re a monument of bullshit .   you even bullshitted yourself all i am ,  is taking out the garbage .   bad guys killing bad guys .  .  . 
well .   that was brilliant . 
that &apos;s love . 
i was only going one way . 
tell you what .   reminds me of life in the delta . 
flip .   you &apos;re the closest thing i got to a friend around here .   tell me something .   you think i &apos;m crazy ? 
i better get going . 
i bit the bastard &apos;s nose off . 
he says a dog bit his nose . 
dead or alive ,  they &apos;ll stick me in there with oswald .   another lunatic acting alone , 
uh uh ,  don &apos;t want them< / u> to see me . 
crown victoria .   f . b . i .  car .   a legitimate tail . 
see ?   wasn &apos;t that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans ? 
more about life on mars .   from a rock they found< / u> on the south pole .  explain that one to me .   but maybe we should go to mars and find out ?  how much do you think that &apos;s going to cost ? 
well that &apos;s the eye right there .  money< / u> .   and all the power and misery it brings with it .  it &apos;s a plot to take over the world .   the master conspiracy .  can take a lifetime to pull off . 
you know why the grateful dead are always on tour ? 
you gave me an hour; now give me a day . 
elaborate on  &apos;they ,  &apos; okay ? 
murdered ? 
i see the big picture and you stumble around in the details . 
what about them ? 
then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box ? 
jerry .   please .   you don &apos;t understand .   i have to know .   it &apos;s all i think about .   do you have any idea what it &apos;s like not to know ? 
get in .   i &apos;ll pull you up to the fourth floor . 
they changed franklin &apos;s portrait . 
i &apos;m a very patient man . 
you shouldn &apos;t watch ,  jerry .   it &apos;s a moment without hope . 
you should think of me as liza sutton &apos;s guardian angel . 
you &apos;re here because you figured i might show up . 
i &apos;m not a violent man ,  mr .  lowry .  not by nature ,  anyhow .   but if you hurt liza in any way ,  i &apos;ll kill you .   does that seem honorable ? 
you made your decision yet ? 
a vulgar pop term ,  but yes .   take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin .   that was our goal . 
we experimented with hallucinogens .   we used electro -  shock to produce a vegetative state .   we conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation . 
as in  &apos;resulting in death .  &apos;  we pushed the envelope until it wasn &apos;t even an envelope anymore . 
a dog . 
belief is immaterial .   what &apos;s important is the truth .  .  .  it &apos;s been my job to find jerry .   i &apos;m very much responsible for him . 
in jerry &apos;s safety deposit box . 
the office is closed for the evening .  is this an emergency ? 
i &apos;ve been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to jerry fletcher .   we &apos;re not to discuss him with the press ,  the n . y . p . d .  ,  anyone .   building police are to arrest him on sight and we &apos;re to report any attempt he makes to contact you . 
dr .  jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate .   why is that ? 
while we walk .   d . c .  police want him for assault .  secret service for counterfeiting and we &apos;re tracking him on a string of bank robberies .   no one knows what the c . i . a .  wants him for . 
that &apos;s the book hinkley had on him when he shot reagan . 
you &apos;re welcome !   spooks .   so ,  you want to compare notes on this guy . 
he &apos;s why i watch jerry .   jerry &apos;s the bait for jonas . 
what ? 
there &apos;s no plug to pull . 
is it possible .  .  .  ? 
mike ,  because of the earth &apos;s rotation we &apos;re only in line with vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations .   if dr .  arroway hadn &apos;t moved quickly we could have lost key elements . 
now i remember why i went into theoretical work .   kent . 
nothing .   okay .   some of us have been a little .  .  .  not concerned ,  exactly ,  but .  .  . 
very well; since my appointment he &apos;s been made interim director . 
mathematics is the only truly universal language ,  senator .   we think this may be a beacon  -  -  an announcement to get our attention . 
apparently he &apos;s genuinely interested in science .   this could be a chance to win him over . 
i want you to listen to me ,  carefully .   the minute the implications of this message became clear ,  this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one  -  -  an extremely complex ,  extremely volatile one .  there are forces at work here you don &apos;t understand; i can help you up to a point ,  but only up to a point . 
nothing .   i guess i just wanted to thank you . 
what does it say ? 
mr .  rank &apos;s organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families ,  dr .  arroway .  feel free to disagree ,  but there won &apos;t be any suppressing of opinions here today . 
dr .  lunacharsky .  .  .  ? 
and ? 
how &apos;s the spying tonight ,  guys ? 
okay ,  let &apos;s just slow down .   pull up the starfield signal origin . 
please answer the question ,  doctor . 
i used .  .  .  i used to dream you were alive .  .  .  and then i &apos;d wake up and lose you all over again . 
s . r .  hadden .  .  .   you compromised our security codes . 
you live here . 
why am i here ,  mr .  hadden ? 
the gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us . 
i read your paper on eti &apos;s .   it &apos;s brilliant . 
please .   any chance of that died the day david drumlin was appointed head of the n . s . f .   i have been in contact with a few other seti people; we &apos;ve been trying to find backing from private investors .  i &apos;ve even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there .  .  . 
but the work  -  - 
and you think i don &apos;t want those things ?   you think i don &apos;t stay up half the night wondering if i &apos;ve made the right choice living half a world away from you ,  wondering if any of this is worth what i &apos;m giving up for it everyday ?   let &apos;s get married . 
right now  -  -  we &apos;ll drive down to ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us . 
someone tell me this is really happening . 
that you ,  valerian ? 
thank god .   when we lost contact ,  i thought  -  -  we thought .  .  .  but you &apos;re okay .   we &apos;re still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction .   did you notice anything at all that  -  - 
what day ? 
champagne please . 
 .  .  .  it &apos;s an old story .   i grew up in south boston ,  more or less on the streets .   by the time i was thirteen i &apos;d tried my first hit of heroin ,  by fifteen i &apos;d stopped using but i was dealing full - time .   by the time i was nineteen i decided i didn &apos;t want to live any more ,  at least not in a world like that .   one day i got on a bus; i got as far as ohio before my money ran out ,  and after that i just kept walking .   didn &apos;t eat ,  didn &apos;t sleep .  .  .  just walked .   i ended up collapsing in a wheat field .   there was a storm .  .  .  i woke up .  .  .   and that &apos;s about as far as words &apos;ll go . 
not exactly .   it has organic qualities ,  but we don &apos;t really understand how they &apos;re integrated with the mechanical systems . 
relativity .   explain this to me one more time .  .  .  even if you traveled near the speed of light ,  when you came back  -  - 
did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn &apos;t science &apos;s fault ,  but meaning &apos;s ? 
do you really believe your life is meaningless ? 
so .   the final countdown . 
ellie ,  what is it ? 
i &apos;m in love with you ,  ellie . 
do you really think your life is meaningless ,  eleanor ?   is that why you &apos;re so quick to risk it  -  -  because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose ? 
hi . 
you &apos;re sure you want to ?   in the universe i saw we &apos;re not exactly the stars of the show .   what happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small . 
you have a question ,  dr .  arroway ? 
oh my god .  .  . 
 .  .  .  as have all attempts at internal analysis .   we &apos;ve tried sonargrams ,  magnetic resonance ,  gamma rays; it &apos;s completely impenetrable . 
boss ,  i made an arrangement with that man to take his broom . 
you never wanted to live forever anyways ,  did you ?  it wasn &apos;t such a hell of a life . 
you think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin &apos; and hollerin &apos; and high hopes ,  but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side .  luke ?

sorry ,  luv .   i &apos;ve got a date . 
he took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong .   he was not acting on mad impulse .   he was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time . 
he told me he had done two others just like it . 
i never hurt nobody .  .  . 
then you get your ass outta here ,  i don &apos;t wanta see you again .  .  .

she didn &apos;t fight back ,  no hair or skin under her fingernails .   i &apos;m not seeing any bruises or contusions .  .  . 
the woman was in shock .   she was totally out on ranks .   i stayed because i didn &apos;t want her to wake up alone in a place where she &apos;d just been under attack .   stop that ,  you son of a bitch !   the place wasn &apos;t secure .   i was doing my goddamn job !   and ,  for the second time< / u> ,  i slept in her living room .

how can you drive ?  james .  .  .  your legs .  you can barely walk . 
do you find him attractive ? 
i wasn &apos;t driving .  i &apos;d left the car in the parking lot at the airport .  could it have been deliberate ? 
you were the last one i saw just before the accident .  do you remember ?  we made love . 
what exactly is your project ,  vaughan ?  ~ book of crashes ?  a medical study ?  a sensational documentary ?  global traffic ? 
he must have driven through a pool of blood .  if the police stop you again ,  they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed .  vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood . 
i &apos;m afraid lhe &apos;s not a doctor . 
oh ,  wait a minute ,  now i see where you &apos;re going . 
you know what ,  ruthie ?  i better get back to my class ,  ok ?

how wonderful ,  darling .   what does that mean for you ? 
oh ,  letty ,  what happened ? 
i &apos;m really not that hungry . 
let me shift gears here a minute .  .  .   do you ever hear voices that other people don &apos;t hear or see things they don &apos;t ? 
how do you sort it -  - by lace and cotton ? 
what have you done with the ring ? 
a small price . 
you must have thought about it .  everyone does . 
what else would you do ? 
then it &apos;s over . 
it &apos;s ok .  you don &apos;t have to say anything . 
this is it  -  -  3b .      check it out .

it &apos;s prettier here than i thought it would be . 
are you all right ? 
of course not ,  no .   is that why you &apos;re here ? 
i talked to ruth a little bit ,  and i think it &apos;s about time .  .  . 
sure .  we &apos;ll save the formal announcement for when you &apos;re out .  i already told your mother .  i hope you don &apos;t mind . 
you can tell me anything .   do you want to postpone the wedding ?  is it too much pressure ? 
whoa .  whoa .  have really loved me ?  letty ,  it &apos;s natural to be nervous .  but we &apos;re going to work through our problems . 
it &apos;s a doctor ,  isn &apos;t it ?  that &apos;s unethical .  i &apos;ll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin . 
you &apos;re going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney - tune that you misguidedly think is love ? 
getting back . 
what ? 
our relationship meant a lot to me ,  too ,  paul .  but it &apos;s over .   and michael being in the hospital doesn &apos;t really change things . 
i &apos;ve got a deposition that i really need to get cracking on ,  so if you don &apos;t mind .  .  . 
how &apos;s it look ? 
i like those sapphire earrings myself . 
no .  you killed her .  manager remembers you going into her room .  your fingerprints were found all over the place .

uh .  .  .  excuse me ,  but don &apos;t you need a warrant or something ? 
hello ? 
i don &apos;t have it .  that &apos;s why vincent went to chicago .  they arrested him before he could bring it back . 
okay .  i understand you &apos;re interested in one of our properties ? 
why are you here ? 
i understand bobby beans came to see you today . 
your own brother ?  you couldn &apos;t send someone else to do it ? 
what is happening with the world ?  there was a time no civilian would touch a made man .  now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something .  what did they take ? 
you rob an associate of mine .  .  .  a friend and -  - 
he &apos;s recorded every conversation he &apos;s had with you for years . 
this plane will take you to canada .  from there you can fly back to paris . 
i don &apos;t know . 
no one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison . 
bastaldi &apos;s dead .  he is fuckin &apos; dead ! 
bring me the scissors . 
that &apos;s an excellent plan .      very comforting .

tell me the truth hector .  .  .  do you think we &apos;ll find my car ? 
hey boss ,  it &apos;s not a science . 
you know why i &apos;m handling it very well ?  because you &apos;re going to get these guys for me . 
if i knew where they were you wouldn &apos;t have to find them ,  would you ? 
and the other car ?

you wouldn &apos;t have understood ,  even if i had tried to explain .   you know .  .  .  you &apos;ve gone as far as you can go .   i hid my skills so as not to hurt you . 
are you related to li mu bai ? 
you know what i mean .   i &apos;m getting married soon ,  but i haven &apos;t lived the life i want . 
you write gracefully .   calligraphy is so similar to fencing . 
too bad for meng ,  but it &apos;s not your fault ,  or li mu bai &apos;s . 
i &apos;ll give them to you . 
keep it safe .   return it to me when we are together again . 
you were enlightened ?

i called not only the boyds but the irvings .   neither of them received invitations . 
some day i &apos;m afraid we &apos;re going to have to tell her about irena . 
can &apos;t you tell me later ? 
what do you mean you didn &apos;t play with the other children ? 
now amy
she gave me a ring ,  so i &apos;m giving her a ring .  i paid twenty - five cents for it ,  too . 
amy ,  answer me .  why did you call her your friend ? 
she &apos;s there ,  just like i said she &apos;d be . 
i &apos;ve wanted a friend . 
there &apos;s an oak leaf .   add a maple . 
oh ,  how beautiful ! 
look at my ring . 
well ,  if it &apos;s a real mourning ring ,  .  i &apos;m going to think hard for something i want more than anything else in the world before i wish . 
little miss ,  you &apos;re stopping me in my work . 
it got hit . 
i &apos;ve been watching you .  you couldn &apos;t see me ,  but i could see you .  it was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began .  you would be a very good audience .  i can see that . 
what ? 
who &apos;s herne the huntsman ? 
and my eyes .  .  . my eyes are gray .  look !  you see ! 
and my hair .  .  . what color hair did barbara have ? 
 &quot; to daddy from amy .  &quot;  here &apos;s one for miss callahan .  this one says ,   &quot; to edward from amy .  &quot;  . 
there was a sale . 
a dog at victoria &apos;s secret ? 
diet and exercise ,  that &apos;s all there is .  i &apos;m not a big proponent of the pms craze ,  but there &apos;s a book my wife mentioned called  &quot; the pms diet ,  &quot;  which may be helpful . 
we &apos;re worried about you .   &quot; 60 minutes &quot;  was on same - sex couples . 
i wonder what it &apos;s like being you .  being noticed all the time . 
he hasn &apos;t said one word to me . 
my date always pays more attention to you than to me . 
i never thought of it like that .  i never know what to do on dates .  do guys still pay ? 
and he was ripped limb from limb ? 
so did you do it ? 
i guess you &apos;re off that vegetarian kick you &apos;ve been on for ten years . 
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever actually liked anyone i &apos;ve dated before .  peter even likes me without makeup . 
how &apos;d it go with the cop ? 
i started out on that eye - of - newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate . 
and what makes you think you killed a man ? 
hello ? 
there &apos;s kind of this guy i &apos;m seeing . 
if you ask me ,  the fucker got what he deserved .  i &apos;m glad he &apos;s dead . 
fuck it &apos;s the cops .  peter saw me ,  now i have to let him in . 
probably for three weeks or so anyway .  i &apos;m not sure  -  -  i don &apos;t get how it works . 
but how do i know if i really love peter ?  and if he really loves me ? 
hello ? 
never been better .  peter spent the night .  i must really love him .  he &apos;s still alive . 
you &apos;re kidding ,  really ? 
you hungry ? 
no .  really ,  i &apos;m .  .  .  i don &apos;t feel well .  i &apos;ve got terrible pms . 
what ,  you got a date or somethin &apos; ? 
frida ,  you know you &apos;re it for me . 
it &apos;s a matter of life and death . 
wow . 
being a cop has such a warm effect on people . 
like what ? 
i really gotta get going . 
but you said the bodies were ripped to pieces ? 
that &apos;s it ?  hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it .  she made us call her a different name .  she &apos;d say ,   &quot; you &apos;re talking to betty now &quot;  and we &apos;d leave the house for a few days . 
you didn &apos;t say it . 
hello ? 
you at least owe me the truth . 
yes ,  your pms .  frida i can deal with that . 
yes .  .  .  i .  .  .  we had dinner . 
come on ,  i &apos;ve been working with frida .  carlton won &apos;t even recognize her now .  she &apos;s really coming out of her shell . 
how the hell is that your business ? 
you want her sheets ? 
nah ,  i don &apos;t wanna break up with wanda ,  i just wanna see carmen too . 
he was found a few blocks away . 
no man .  blood is not a turn on .  you sure let that frida off the hook .  you weren &apos;t even going to take the sheets .  if i didn &apos;t know better ,  i &apos;d think you liked her . 
this is more than fishy ,  this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead . 
she &apos;s got a hidden pitbull .  maybe she hired someone to kill them . 
poseur was missing a chunk of his neck .  and his eyes were open .  that always bugs me out .  do me a favor ,  if some mutherfucker &apos;s about to blow me away ,  remind me to close my fuckin &apos; eyes . 
yeah okay .  i still say frida &apos;s involved .  she &apos;s the last one to see two dudes alive .  .  . 
he means the last that we know of . 
spencer &apos;s the key here .  frida is in no way associated with him .  and her blood hasn &apos;t matched with any of the killings . 
it has to be frida .  this makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass . 
to tell you the truth ,  i &apos;m glad we &apos;ve run into each other like this .   maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends . 
i met a friend of yours the other night ,  doctor .   tall fellow .   no hair .   rather pale skin .  .  . 
good evening ,  sir . 
lost something ? 
yes .   that &apos;s right .   he &apos;s ill   -   he needs expert help . 
dont ever sneak up on me like that !  who are you ? 
im your new assistant . 
people .  .  .   after me . 
they &apos;ve taken my mind ,  my memories .  .  . 
is that your idea of a joke ?   i don &apos;t remember .  .  .   take my advice ,  bumstead .   get off this case .   now . 
you see it ? 
we are little more than a sum of memories .   from them we reference who we are ,  where we &apos;re going .   without a past we are nothing .   this is why you are so interesting . 
why ? 
you understand what you &apos;ll be doing ? 
don &apos;t say a  . 
first thing we &apos;re gonna work on is the mannerisms .   alan has put together sort of a training program
dave .  .  . 
the washington post . 
you &apos;re nothing .   do you understand me !  you &apos;re nobody .  .  . 
you &apos;re lint !   you &apos;re a flea !   you &apos;re a blip ! 
they say it hit both sides of his brain .  .  .  even if he makes it he &apos;s gonna be a vegetable . 
i don &apos;t give a shit . 
yes  -   -  and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon . 
when does it break ? 
no !  .  .  .   we didn &apos;t anything .  .  . 
what &apos;s with the cameras ? 
it &apos;s not his job  -  -  it &apos;s my job ! 
i &apos;m serious ,  dave  -  -  you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this . 
you know  -  -  priorities .   remember when you couldn &apos;t get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano ? 
you sure ?   a coke or a perrier or something ? 
in the car . 
president vetoes works bill ? 
alan .  .  . 
now he &apos;s making stuff up about me . 
the fidelity nonsense .  .  . 
they re not my attack dogs . 
oh .  .  .  hi . 
oh my god .  .  .   i thought it was a legitimate deduction ,  i swear to god .  see .  .  .  i need a piano for my work sometimes .  .  . 
your government needs your help . 
thanks for doing this ,  ellen . 
you bet . 
that &apos;s not just a works bill you vetoed  -  -  that would have given these kids homes .  .  .    .  .  .  when i think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick .  .  . 
oh .  .  .  yeah . 
how were you gonna get home ? 
he said he &apos;ll pick it up in a couple of days . 
so what do you do the rest of the time ? 
yes . 
what &apos;s wrong ? 
we &apos;re all set ,   sir . 
please .  .  .  . shoot me . 
his madness .  .  .  . could be from shock . 
it &apos;s some kind of .  .  .  . elevator .  there must be something under the ground here .  .  .  . maybe .  .  .  . military . 
what do we do ?  let &apos;em know we &apos;re here .  .  .  . or what ? 
i know it hurts .  but it won &apos;t be long .  then all the pain will be over .  oh ,  i wish you could hear me .  god ,  give her the ears to hear me so she knows i don &apos;t want her to hurt so ! 
tonight ? 
bees .  that &apos;s what we call the dead .  .  .  the walking dead .  .  . here on gasparilla &apos;s island . 
he was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago .  his name is bein &apos; borrowed these days by the long lost henry dickerson . 
that &apos;s the man .  he &apos;s been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan .  him and his family owned these islands  &apos;round here .  they was leasin &apos; this one to the fed .  the whole underneath is dug out .  there was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing ,  nuclear power ,  all o &apos; that .  now this is dickerson &apos;s .  .  .  . gasparilla &apos;s .  .  .  private fortress .  him and a bunch o &apos; his cronies from all the best golf courses in tallahassee .  .  . and his private army ,  of course . 
what ? 
i didn &apos;t realise !  those were de - caps !  i didn &apos;t know that .  .  .  . de - caps .  .  .  revived ! 
he is dying .  he knows it . 
come ,  come ,  miss science .  you &apos;ve seen worse . 
you &apos;re .  .  .  . you &apos;re disgusting !  you &apos;re .  .  .  . filth ! 
it &apos;s because of me . 
i can work here .  maybe my work can help .  .  . help everyone .  i can do more good with access to this equipment than i can off in some wasteland .

she couldn &apos;t be gone ! 
stevens !

of course .  why man ,  you have one of the richest farms in the county .   you just go about it the wrong way  -  -  so many men do .  hard work  -  -  well ,  that &apos;s all right for people who don &apos;t know how to do anything else .  it &apos;s all right for people who aren &apos;t lucky  -  -  but once you &apos;re lucky  -  -  you don &apos;t work for other people .  you make them work for you . 
where did it come from ? 
what a headstrong fellow !  well  -  -  i guess you &apos;re quite prepared to suffer the consequences . 
oh no ,  you violated clause five of our contract and i could collect right now ,  if i chose . 
suddenly you seem quite desperate ,  mr .  stone  -  -    -  -  you know i &apos;m a good - natured man .  i &apos;m always open to reason .  with a little security  -  -  i might -  - 
i don &apos;t seem to be so very popular after all  -  -  in cross corners .

very well .   -  -  you shall have your trial ,  mr .  webster .  the case is hardly one for an ordinary jury  -  - 
your honor  -  -  gentlemen of the jury  -  -  this case need not detain us long .  it concerns one thing alone  -  -  the transference ,  barter and sale of a certain piece of property ,  to wit ,  his soul by jabez stone .  that transference ,  barter or sale is attested by a deed .  i offer that deed in evidence and mark it exhibit a . 
i wanted to give it all to the church .

i was .   so ?   mr .  pecharda let me in .  as you know ,  with all my responsibilities i often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so .  but i left very early ,  around 6 : 30 . 
what do you mean ? 
act surprised .  walk slowly to the podium .   be modest .   thank them for this incredible honor . 
plenty of pep ,  too .

hey yeah ? 
three twenty - five . 
don &apos;t say that .   you know it &apos;s not true . 
but you &apos;ve got a big choice right now .  you can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life .  or you can choose to see it for what it really is :  an opportunity .   i personally think you have a big future ahead of you ,  and i don &apos;t mean the fleeting glory of sports . 
253 .  .  .  254 .  .  .  255 .  i get the same as you jim .  looks like paul &apos;s our president .

there &apos;s blood on your shirt .   is that an integral part of your job ? 
do you enjoy it ? 
do you like being a cop ,  bud ?

four of the defendants recanted their testimony . 
how what ,  wendell ? 
give me one minute . 
i &apos;ve long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation .   that day will soon be here and you &apos;ll share handsomely .   grand means will be in our hands ,  wendell .  
we were never properly introduced .  susan and i were fighting that day .   she called him by a nickname .   muns or lunts or something .

ed ,  your observations have been astute .   what &apos;s your assessment of this situation ? 
that fucking larry .   i almost believed him . 
i heard you like to shoot dogs .

reciprocity ,  mr .  hudgeons ,  is the key to all relationships . 
and ? 
you &apos;ll make lieutenant inside a year .   patrol division ? 
dudley ,  we &apos;ve been over this . 
stensland &apos;s a disgrace .   straight d fitness reports from every c . o .  he ever served under .   but white is a valuable officer .

i should &apos;ve known .   what &apos;s the chief throwing you ? 
i need to speak to you . 
damnit .  .  .  what< / u> ? 
even i &apos;m not that crazy . 
transfer me ,  suspend me .   just leave me alone . 
okay ,  college boy ,  i &apos;ll help you .  but i want half the collar . 
i &apos;ll tell you what i told officer white when he asked me about susan &apos;s death . 
for the last time .   i may suborn women into illicit activities ,  but they &apos;re handsomely compensated ,  i treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect . 
lynn bracken .

i was worried about my hundred and twenty  &apos;k &apos; .

they &apos;re fresh .   i haven &apos;t eaten an egg inhave you noticed there are chickens ?  you get chickens in italy but no eggs .  in africa there were always eggs ,  but never chickens .  who separates them ? 
you have to protect yourself from sadness .   this is the thing i &apos;ve learned .   you &apos;re in love with him ,  aren &apos;t you ?  your patient .   do you think he &apos;s a saint or something ?   because of the way he looks ?   i don &apos;t think he is . 
oh ,  all over . 
me ?   you &apos;ve got the wrong end of the stick ,  old boy .   so  -  caravaggio  -  hana thinks you invented your name . 
top hat . 
what ?   you and madox ?   or you and katharine clifton ? 
and did you never see katharine ?  you never got back to the cave ? 
sweetheart ,  you know we can &apos;t go home ,  there might be a war . 
before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me ? 
i will hide you in the room where we sleep ,  said candaules .  she stumbles over the word . 
excuse me  - 
this is captain mcgann . 
i liked it better when there were just the two of us . 
for my hair ? 
why would anyone do this ? 
what are you up to ? 
will you come with me ? 
hey !   hey !   stop !   hey ! 
i &apos;ll come with you . 
what i really object to ,  uncle ,  is your finishing all my condensed milk .   and the message everywhere in your book  -  however slowly i read it  -  that the best destiny for india is to be ruled by the british . 
what are you talking about ? 
that &apos;s doable . 
don &apos;t overestimate yourself . 
where are you at least ? 
i can &apos;t ? 
i &apos;m sorry about the scroll ,  but sometimes you have to lose to win . 
believe me ,  if you weren &apos;t so tiresome ,  i &apos;d have one for you . 
seems i am . 
i &apos;ve got something for you . 
the empress death mask . 
i suspected it might be worthy of your interest . 
how much am i paying ? 
a film case . 
lose something ? 
years ago ,  if memory serves .  when does the exhibit end ? 
the rembrandt -  - that was quite good . 
don &apos;t worry ,  i can get rid of this .  no trace .  and i &apos;ll even go fifty fifty ,  we &apos;re partners aren &apos;t we ? 
all this ,  this is a woman &apos;s version of what you would like . 
got it . 
certainly the most beautiful crook i &apos;ve ever seen . 
you were afraid of heights ? 
stop !  you &apos;re making .  .  . mistake . 
no ,  really ,  it &apos;s your plan ,  you should get at least 30 per cent -  - 
hmmm .  .  . 44 long . 
oh my god ,  i thought -  - 
what about the rules ? 
every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches .  as soon as each deposit lands somewhere ,  it &apos;s shot somewhere else .  it ends up so clean the mafia couldn &apos;t find it . 
nope .  the cd instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded xj - 6 . 
that &apos;s where the mask comes in . 
there &apos;s always a surprise . 
parachute . 
done .   and i assume you have the magic cd -  rom ? 
four billion dollars . 
gin ,  really . 
i need you to get one more thing for me .  a dress ,  elegant but sexy ,  something grace kelly would wear .  maybe a balenciaga . 
i &apos;d say she &apos;s a size 6 who wears a size 4 . 
oh ,  it is . 
you better not be taking on a new partner . 
this is just show and tell . 
call it an expression of trust . 
take this mask .  it may look like the empress ,  but it &apos;s not . 
tequila .   from your drug dealer friend . 
seventeen thousand in debt .   whew .   is your ex - husband helping out ? 
meningitis ?   what the hell is meningitis ? 
well  -  -  then it &apos;s gotta be a different than what &apos;s in our water ,  cause ours is okay .  the guys from pg&e told me .   they sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine . 
i don &apos;t even know how much money that is . 
so what &apos;s the story on this thing ?   this cancer stuff ? 
so what made you think it was ? 
what medical records ? 
at least they made an offer . 
i don &apos;t get why they &apos;d do that . 
we can get these people .   with a little effort ,  i really think we can nail their asses to the wall . 
is that what i think it is ? 
hey .   i like working with you . 
he &apos;s gone .   did you get a license plate ?   or a make ? 
what kind of things come up ? 
do you think we &apos;d do better by going to trial ? 
holy shit .   who do they represent ,  god ? 
why good ? 
people don &apos;t fly down in their own god damn plane for  &quot; just a meeting &quot;   -  - 
look ,  this is serious now .   they &apos;re talking serious money  -  - 
the fuck i &apos;m not .   i don &apos;t care what the doctor says  -  - 
morning ! 
but i know you &apos;re not gonna quit on me . 
yeah .   yours is nicer . 
when &apos;d they file the demur ? 
and you were told to destroy those ? 
you come to the right place . 
you &apos;re married . 
hey ,  ross .   tell me something .   does pg&e pay you to cover their ass ,  or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart ? 
so that stuff  -  -  it kills people . 
hunh - uh .   what &apos;s that ? 
you &apos;ve been reading for hours . 
there &apos;s no way a son of mine hates funky town .   it &apos;s impossible . 
we &apos;ll work out the roller hockey thing ,  okay ?   whatever you want ,  we &apos;ll work it out .  i promise . 
how come her own mom isn &apos;t helping her ? 
don &apos;t talk to me like i &apos;m an idiot ,  okay ?   i may not have a law degree ,  but i &apos;ve spent 18 months on this case ,  and i know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will . 
ooh ,  now ,  see ,  if i &apos;da known there was a beautiful woman next door ,  i &apos;da done this different .   let &apos;s start over .   my name &apos;s george .   what &apos;s yours ? 
i &apos;m not gonna leave my kids with you . 
great .   another deadbeat . 
yeah ?   and what do you do the rest of the time ,  live off your trust fund ? 
you &apos;re around every afternoon ? 
you mind telling me what that &apos;s supposed to mean ? 
about this . 
it &apos;s a pair of earrings .   i saw  &apos;em in the mall one day ,  and i thought ,  damn ,  those would look good on those beautiful earlobes .  so i bought  &apos;em .   and i said to myself ,  next time erin says something nice ,  does something nice ,  i &apos;ll surprise her with  &apos;em .   know how long ago that was ?   six months .   in six months ,  you haven &apos;t said one nice thing to me .   that &apos;s a long time . 
i know .   but still .   six months .   i think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend .   cause there may be men who don &apos;t mind being the maid and getting nothing in return ,  but i &apos;m sure as shit not one of  &apos;em . 
thank you . 
i don &apos;t do favors for you anymore . 
think you could learn ? 
what ? 
now how &apos;m i supposed to do that when i &apos;m not in here most mornings and nights ? 
i know .   it &apos;s an awful lot . 
hi ,  sweetie .   were you a good girl ?   where are matt and katie ? 
who &apos;s baxter ? 
our pursuit ships have sighted the millennium falcon ,  my lord .   it has entered an asteroid field . 
soon ,  lord vader . 
he &apos;ll learn . 
luke ,  use the force only for knowledge and for defense ,  not as a weapon .   don &apos;t give in to hate or anger or fear  .  .  .  they lead the way to the dark side  .  .  .  luke nods and climbs back into his ship . 
i can &apos;t  .  .  . 
 .  .  .  luke ,  you must not go . 
will you ?   you underestimate the emperor .   it is you he wants  .  .  .  that is why your friends suffer . 
how you doing ,  chewbacca ?   still wasting your time with this clown ,  eh ? 
turns on lando ,  the newcomer ,  with an ominous growl . 
commander skywalker hasn &apos;t come through the south entrance ,  sir .  maybe he slipped by without checking in . 
he doesn &apos;t make sense to me either ,  chewie . 
droid of some kind .   i didn &apos;t hit it that hard .   it must have had a self - destruct  .  .  .  . 
that was no laser blast  .  .  .  .  some -  thing hit us  .  .  .  . 
let &apos;s hope so  .  .  .  it &apos;s just the chance we need . 
there ,  there .   chewie get a reading on that .   looks pretty good . 
why ,  princess ,  this is so sudden . 
you don &apos;t look angry . 
there &apos;s nothing dull about a man i can depend on to be civilized . 
not bad ,  hot shot ,  not bad .   then what ? 
i don &apos;t like this . 
you look silly . 
well ,  i do trust him .   lando &apos;s an old friend .   must have been an accident . 
loud and clear ,  kid .   what &apos;s up ? 
that won &apos;t be easy ,  my friend  .  .  .  what brings you here ,  anyway ? 
that was never mentioned .   neither was this bounty hunter taking han .  i hope you haven &apos;t forgotten our bargain . 
that wasn &apos;t the bargain .   you said the empire wouldn &apos;t interfere in -  - 
i &apos;m sure my men fixed it .   we &apos;ve got nothing to worry about . 
rather touchy ,  aren &apos;t they . 
leia  .  .  .  what would you think if i went away for a while ? 
okay .   i &apos;ll give it a try . 
i don &apos;t believe it . 
that they are . 
what &apos;s in there ? 
and sacrifice han and leia ? 
your future lies with us ,  skywalker .  now you will embrace the dark side .  obi - wan knew this to be true . 
there is much obi - wan did not tell you .   come ,  the emperor will complete your training . 
all too easy .   perhaps you are not as strong as the emperor thought . 
the hoth system ? 
yes ,  my lord . 
humans ? 
the cigarette girl in new vegas was an undercover cop .  she injected you with incentive toxin .  right now it &apos;s swimming in your bloodstream .  it &apos;ll start to take effect in 9 hours . 
ooww ! 
where is he ? 
why should we leave ?  i love l . a .  where we gonna go ?  what &apos;s the payoff ? 
i was called away on urgent business ,  snake . 
get me to cuervo jones .  get me to the kingdom .  i got one hour . 
i don &apos;t know ,  sounds thin to me . 
top secret .  only on a need to know . 
maybe .  but you &apos;re not putting any shit in me this time . 
get this crap out of me . 
so you want me to take her out ?   is that an order from the president ? 
you &apos;re a star in your own right ,  you know that ?  hey ,  i &apos;m map to the stars eddie .  how you doin &apos; ? 
stop the damn car . 
you ain &apos;t doin &apos; so good ,  snake .  you need help .   you should talk to hershe .  she hates cuervo .  they used to be partners ,  but they split up . 
who ? 
snake  -  what is it ? 
hasn &apos;t merlin mended your wound ? 
you saved me from the arrow .  .  . 
i should have left you to fend for yourself . 
where hides evil ,  then ,  in my kingdom ? 
with all your powers ,  you are content to be ridiculed ,  laughed at .  .  . 
me ?  i have lived by the oath of king and knight . 
 -  - stories .  .  .  you brought me back .  your love brought me back .  back to where you are now ,  in the land of dreams .  .  . 
it didn &apos;t hurt too much ,  did it ? 
but i have to leave tomorrow .  the forests are thick with rebels ,  invaders plunder our shores .  .  . 
and you cannot love me .  .  . 
the well - kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart . 
just a man .  a knight in the king &apos;s service . 
what do you want ?  you must desire it for me to weave it . 
you provoke me ,  merlin . 
it &apos;s done .  a truce .  we meet at the river . 
i have walked my way since the beginning of time .  sometimes i give ,  sometimes i take .  it is mine to know which ,  and when . 
well why are they tearing the building down ? 
that &apos;s right mike .  but he &apos;s finished and came back around three ot four months ago ,  he &apos;s in woodstock now . 
no ,  he &apos;s working on another book . 
you &apos;d want to do the exorcism yourself ? 
here . 
i &apos;m gonna miss you . 
strange .  .  . strange .  .  . so baffling .  the deceased comes to visit ,  stays only twenty minutes ,  and leaves all alone a very sick girl .  and speaking plainly mrs .  macneil ,  as you say ,  it &apos;s not likely he would fall from a window .  besides that ,  a fall wouldn &apos;t do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand .  my hunch ?  my opinion ?  i believe he was killed by a very powerful man :  point one .  and the fracturing of the skull  -  point two  -  plus the various things i have mentioned ,  would make it very probable  -  probable ,  not certain  -  that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter &apos;s window .  but no - one was here except your daughter .  so how could this be ?  it could be one way :  if someone came calling between the time miss spencer left and the time you returned .  the servants ,  they have visitors ? 
would you like some more coffee ? 
i know that .  i realize .  but if a certain british doctor never asked  &quot; what &apos;s this fungus ?  &quot;  we wouldn &apos;t today have penicillin .  correct ? 
thank you . 
rats ? 
yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps . 
there is nothing . 
bastard !  i will kill you . 
is it coming out willie ? 
lies ? 
have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities ? 
she used those words ? 
yeah ,  i guess .  maybe not .  you don &apos;t think a psychiatrist -  ? 
where ? 
pretty close ? 
about my daughter ? 
he didn &apos;t mention ? 
i mean ,  what if a person ,  let &apos;s say ,  was a criminal ,  like maybe a murderer or something ,  you know ?  if he came to you for help ,  would you have to turn him in ? 
you wouldn &apos;t . 
and how do you go about getting an exorcism ? 
to begin with it could make things worse . 
well before the church approves an exorcism ,  it conducts an investigation to see if it &apos;s warranted .  that takes time .  in the meantime .  .  . 
no ,  you don &apos;t understand .  your daughter - 
i can &apos;t do it .  i need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession . 
did regan know a priest was coming over ? 
she .  .  . killed burke dennings . 
what kind of stuff ? 
mr .  dennings ? 
yeah i like him .  don &apos;t you like him ?  hey what &apos;s going on ?  what is this ? 
over behind the church ,  you know where i mean over there ,  it &apos;s a red brick wing ? 
there haven &apos;t been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so -  called split personality ,  mrs .  macneil .  now i know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry ,  but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first . 
i &apos;m affraid you might hurt yourself regan . 
he broke the bread ,  gave it to his disciples and said  &quot; take this ,  all of you and eat .  for this is my body .  &quot;  when the supper had ended ,  he took the cup ,  again he gave you thanks and praise .  gave the cup to his disciples and said  &quot; take this ,  all of you will drink from it ,  this is the cup of blood ,  the blood of the new and ever lasting covenant and the mystery of faith &quot;  . 
did you do that ? 
how long are you planning to stay in regan ? 
no . 
do you want to hear the background of the case ,  first ? 
and dennings ,  you read how he died ? 
let me tell you how father ,  and please confidential .  burke dennings ,  good father ,  was found at the bottom of those steps leading to  &apos;m &apos; street ,  with his head turned completely around .  facing backwards . 
maybe somebody crazy ,  someone with a spite against the church ,  some unconscious rebellion ,  perhaps . 
ah ,  doctor &apos;s ethics .  if you knew you wouldn &apos;t tell ,  huh ? 
hey ,  father ?  you like movies ? 
one last time :  can you think of some priest who fits the bill ? 
who ? 
 .  .  . be gone !  ! 
twelve years . 
so ? 
just the same . 
decay unfortunately doesn &apos;t limit itself to the denture ,  mr .  baker .  it spreads into his chest .  then the heart goes .  we wouldn &apos;t want that ,  would we ? 
start him out on cottage cheese .  if you &apos;ve got him on kibble ,  just soak it a few minutes .   go down like pudding through a hot pipe . 
piano . 
knee .   tore it up against st .  anthony &apos;s .   right before the accident . 
come on ,  friend .   i can smell it on you .  get yourself a cup of coffee .   you &apos;ll forget what you &apos;re angry about . 
uh  .  .  .  yeah ,  well ,  you know ,  ma ,  john kennedy went by jack . 
i thought these were lost .  where did you find  .  .  . 
tag  &apos;em ,  willie .   the regency downtown ,  thursday - friday .   thanks . 
jack . 
count it . 
they don &apos;t .   they &apos;re always asking about you . 
you look awful . 
your older brother . 
charlie paid you off last night ,  didn &apos;t he ? 
no ? 
it &apos;s more like 40 - 60 ,  wouldn &apos;t you say ? 
that &apos;s what we agreed . 
two pianos isn &apos;t enough anymore ,  jack . 
all right ,  all right .   i &apos;m a little tense . 
yeah  .  .  .  well ,  i gotta go . 
how &apos;s it coming ? 
you haven &apos;t seen susie ,  have you ? 
what &apos;re you trying to do ?   wake up the whole goddamn hotel ? 
you saw wrong . 
he had to come quickly .   it was a big leak . 
they were simple songs . 
god ,  the old man would &apos;ve loved this view ,  wouldn &apos;t he ? 
be reasonable ,  jack . 
what disease ? 
we &apos;re on after meadowlark .   what &apos;s wrong ? 
what ? 
stay off it . 
right . 
the audience was a little off tonight . 
you got no right springing this on me ,  frankie .  it &apos;s unethical . 
but if you call my house and my mother answers ,  ask for blanche .   if you ask for monica ,  she &apos;ll think you have the wrong number and hang up . 
how should i take it ? 
i don &apos;t believe it .   i come all the way down down here ,  break a heel ,  and you &apos;re not gonna give me a chance because i have gum on my lip and i &apos;m a few minutes late . 
shoes ? 
fucking . 
we are not a saloon act .   we do not take tips from dirty old men . 
got another song for us ? 
that song .   i can &apos;t sing it anymore .  i &apos;m gonna get sick . 
yes ,  sir .   that &apos;s quite a girl you boys latched onto .   she a local ? 
how come ? 
funny hours . 
brought it . 
you miss him ,  don &apos;t you ? 
where &apos;s egghead ? 
nice place .   fulla velvet .   even the bedspreads .   damn !   two - fifty a pack and i go through  &apos;em like toothpicks .  twelve - and - a - half cents a piece ,  you believe that ? 
he do that every year ? 
aren &apos;t the kids asleep ? 
can &apos;t sleep ? 
relax .   we &apos;ll drop the song . 
what &apos;d i say ? 
you &apos;re upset . 
you were good . 
shit .   i think i started a fire . 
jack . 
yeah .   the big boys sent it down yesterday . 
in the old days ,  every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop .   then ,  whenever he wanted a shave ,  held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug ,  waiting for him . 
ivory . 
do i look wasted  -  -  asshole ? 
try to kiss my butt just once before i &apos;m transferred . 
uh - oh ,  somebody &apos;s in trouble . 
you shouldn &apos;t have brought me here  .  .  .  it &apos;s dangerous . 
i hear you &apos;re a manicurist now  -  -  got your own business and everything .   i &apos;m glad you &apos;ve stayed clean . 
why would he need more ? 
pollux  .  .  . 
uh  -  -  to kill the doctors ? 
that &apos;s not the worst part . 
totally  -  -  you were being very ,  very bad .   you went up in the plane and jumped out .   you had a parachute ,  but it didn &apos;t open . 
who is this ? 
okay ,  you &apos;re having an emotional crisis .   you need to seek the help of a trained  -  - 
i know you  -  -  you &apos;re the one who called .   you &apos;re castor troy .   you killed my son  -  - 
i started wondering  -  -  if you couldn &apos;t switch back  -  -  would it make a difference ? 
now what ? 
jon ,  i &apos;m getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun . 
jamie  .  .  . 
they &apos;re too tight . 
you &apos;ll what ? 
archer cut him a deal for turning state &apos;s evidence .  he &apos;s free . 
sfpd ?   castor isn &apos;t stupid enough to come back to the city . 
commander ,  what are you doing here ? 
 -  -  i &apos;ll be one of the most powerful men in the country .  didn &apos;t matter how much cash i made pulling wet jobs  -  -  i was still too low on the food chain  -  -  always with somebody like jon archer after me .   the best part is  -  -  i &apos;m the good guy . 
what &apos;s that ? 
i just heard about castor &apos;s fratricide  -  -  rather poetic ,  don &apos;t you think ? 
as much as ever .   nothing . 
jon  -  -  i don &apos;t have time to play games .   there &apos;re leftovers in the fridge .

kate reynolds was my girlfriend in college .   i almost married her .  .  . 
she didn &apos;t want me to go to london .   we &apos;re standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay . 
no .  .  . 
i &apos;ll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon .   call the group .   schedule an emergency strategy session for noon . 
hello ?

hey jack ,  youre all flush .   i guess that seventy - one took a lot outta you .

what did you wish for ,  honey ? 
what are you< / u> doing here ? 
we can monitor the cloud &apos;s approach and observe the tests from here . 
we need to give you a physical ,  so we know what got zapped . 
now what is up with that< / i> ? 
oh ,  you dawg you .   better not be my nurse ! 
what ?   no .   i &apos;m trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms . 
johnny .   supernova . 
the synthetics act as a second skin ,  adapting to your individual needs to  -  -

you &apos;re happy< / u> for me and victor . 
uh ,  sue .  .  .  ?   i can &apos;t< / u> . 
it has to be the cloud .   it &apos;s fundamentally altered our dna . 
it &apos;s not  &quot; invisibility &quot;  per se .  you &apos;re bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field .   that &apos;s what you projected on the bridge . 
which is why i &apos;m working twenty< / u> hours a day ,  checking every variable  -  - 
remember our first date here .  .  .  ?   god ,  i was so nervous . 
you always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you .  .  . speak his mind .   one who wasn &apos;t afraid to tell you what he wanted . 
when i walked out ,  i waited ten< / u> minutes< / u> outside your door .   ten .  waiting for you to come find me . 
what are you doing ? 
victor ,  wait ,  slow down a second .   i want you to know i appreciate everything you &apos;ve done for me ,  but i just don &apos;t  -  - 
i know that .  but what &apos;s the maximum ? 
at topspeed .  .  . and adjusting distance for degree of miniaturization  -  -   the sub should get through the heart in fifty - seven seconds . 
what are the problems in stopping the heart ? 
<cardiac red alert> we &apos;re stopping the heart . 
time &apos;s up .  .  .  we &apos;ll have to take them out immediately . 
now how soon can we try sodium pentathol ? 
his technician okay ?  in addition to the looks department ? 
i don &apos;t mean to be inquisitive .  but this <cmdf>  -  -  for all i know it could stand for <consolidated mobilization of female delinquents> ? 
there &apos;ll be a team of surgeons standing by .  we &apos;re prepared to remove you immediately ,  should anything go wrong .  in any event ,  you must be out within sixty minutes .  after that ,  you &apos;ll be in danger of attack . 
just one ,  general .  .  . 
difficult ?  he &apos;s impossible ! 
i &apos;ll be standing by .  <i &apos;ll> know . 
doctor .  .  . you can &apos;t mean that !  not when we &apos;ve come this far .  and if we give up ,  there &apos;ll be no way of saving mr .  benes  -  - 
cora ,  is something wrong with the laser ? 
a long time ,  with one man . 
 -  -  at which point the heart will be stopped by electric shock . 
then how come it worked loose ? 
if you had a transistor about this size and power output ,  and a thin enough wire  -  -    -  -  could you piece it together ? 
but that isn &apos;t possible . 
we can &apos;t take a second more . 
i &apos;ll do nothing of the sort !  the operation is <my> responsibility !  i won &apos;t do it ,  and that &apos;s final ! 
the ship &apos;s good as finished .  we &apos;ll have to get out on our own !  is there a quick way out ? 
you said there was a quick way out ! 
we need you for security purposes ,  mr .  grant . 
miss peterson ,  his technical assistant . 
if we can &apos;t go back ,  is there an alternate route ? 
in a way  -  -  yes .  those are impurities imbedded in the lung after a lifetime of  &apos;civilization .  &apos; carbon from smoke and smog  -  -  specks of dust  -  - 
yes  -  -  with all that pressure ,  and suction within  -  - 
well ,  sir ?  which is it ?  the wireless ,  or benes &apos; life ?

a major prick . 
i think it &apos;s time for some recreational activity ,  girl . 
did you hear that ? 
but i thought .  .  . 
she never should &apos;ve set foot on this ship .  this is your fault ! 
dear christ .  .  . 
what are you doing in here ? 
i demand to know what is going on .  .  . 
i doubt very much that one even exists .

why are you doing this to yourself ? 
can &apos;t we at least talk about it ? 
rennie  -  -  i was just on my way over to your room
i can &apos;t swim .

rennie .  .  . 
i don &apos;t know .  .  . we &apos;ve gone off course or something .  .  . 
we must abandon . 
elliot ? 
and he was there ? 
where are you going ? 
i used to carry a gun when i drove a cab . 
in other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse ?  the man is out there ruining lives . 
this could be it . 
we &apos;re able to surprise each other . 
so at the intermission i can listen to the ball game .  do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer ? 
because you refuse to believe she &apos;s serious .  you &apos;ve always refused . 
laurel .  tickets are all set .  i double - checked .

i &apos;ve been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer . 
there may be things you &apos;d rather not know about . 
i am really ,  deeply sorry . 
who is it ? 
what do you want ? 
if it &apos;s you ,  what are you doing here ? 
across ninth avenue .  dodgie &apos;s .  where you &apos;ve been getting your hair cut for fifty years .  where uncle billy and uncle marty got their hair cut .  where jim rorty shot a man for cheating at poker . 
it &apos;s a constant shock to me ,  how small this place is .  how did we do it ?  five people in these little rooms . 
we must have been heroic . 
hey ,  pop .  i know you don &apos;t like the commotion of opening night .  but i especially want you to see this play .  it &apos;s new territory for me .  and for you too .  i have to know what you think . 
some little kid stole the hubcaps . 
it &apos;s the kid &apos;s lucky day . 
frankie lazzaro .  coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media .  children see this .  they think you &apos;re the secretary of the treasury . 
say it and you &apos;ll believe it .  life is good .  say it . 
this could be it ! 
aybe we ought to postpone the opening . 
 &apos;m not worried about this kid . 
what do you mean ? 
why ? 
you &apos;ve worked with elliot ? 
would you like to meet him ? 
oww ! 
sora was sent to tell me i  -  -  i must rake and cover the latrine . 
 &quot; take a fifth step ,  that we may serve the people .  &quot; 
what do you expect when you talk like that ? 
i  -  -  i mean it &apos;s all right .  it doesn &apos;t matter .   i &apos;m  -  -  my name is andrews ,  charlie andrews .  i &apos;ve come from india  -  -  i &apos;ve read a great deal about you . 
 .  .  . and i knew something had to give .  and i was determined to be here when it did . 
what &apos;d he say ? 
i &apos;ll take your luggage back ,  baas . 
i don &apos;t believe it  -  -  even the british can &apos;t be that stupid ! 
well ,  it &apos;s quite a place ,  your  &quot; ashram &quot;   -  -  is that right ? 
do you remember much of south africa ? 
i will not sit by to see the mastery of the british replaced by the mastery of the hindus ! 
you mean you employ mr .  baker as your attorney ,  but you can &apos;t walk down the street with him ? 
 .  .  . there &apos;s been no time to keep figures ,  but there must be ninety  -  -  a hundred thousand under arrest .   and it still goes on . 
who are you trying to convince ? 
of course that doesn &apos;t jibe with what we found .   this was an angry killing . 
we &apos;re in the wrong place .   we &apos;re wasting time . 
the skin flake was found in michael &apos;s restaurant .  the employees are all accounted for . 
don &apos;t underestimate these imposters . 
would you care to look -  - in the telescope ? 
one look through there and you would know why i can &apos;t possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further . 
at least it &apos;s nothing contagious . 
i don &apos;t know exactly ,  jerome . 
what about you ?   what &apos;s in this for you ,  eugene ? 
i gotta stop !  !   i gotta stop !  ! 
i &apos;m sorry .   i &apos;m sorry .

not thirsty ?   we &apos;ve got enough virgin samples to last us the week . 
where are we going ? 
how are you ,  jerome ? 
why have you done this ? 
you &apos;ve already specified blue eyes ,  dark hair and fair skin .   i have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions  -  premature baldness ,  myopia ,  alcoholism and addictive susceptibility ,  propensity for violence and obesity -  - 
no bother . 
can that be ,  er ,  verified ?   were you alone ? 
who are they ? 
what is it ? 
 -  - when you go away . 
a year is a long time . 
i &apos;ve got enough here . 
just remember ,  lamar ,  i could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser -  - 
i told you ,  the government pays .   it &apos;s all taken care of . 
 -  - i &apos;ve read your profile .   i don &apos;t know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own .   you can have other children . 
the name ?   for the certificate . 
you gotta be kidding . 
i guess it was because i was a model prisoner . 
rudy butler ,  frank jackson .  .  . 
that &apos;s your problem . 
a simple reason ,  mccoy .  the obvious reason .  to rob a bank . 
thanks again .   i  &apos;m glad you waited . 
why are you laughing ? 
i didn &apos;t .  i just waited . 
promise you won &apos;t laugh . 
you know i &apos;ve actually gotten tired waiting sometimes .  .  .  worn out waiting .

we haven &apos;t got a lead .  .  . 
i &apos;ll show you how to chew it .  &quot;  your pal closes ,  all that comes out of your mouth is bile ,  how fucked up you are .  .  . 
they didn &apos;t get your contract .   i filed it before i left . 
you closed him yesterday . 
how are you ,  honey ?   you &apos;ve met merle ,  haven &apos;t you .   he was with me in vegas . 
we &apos;re going to europe next week .   i want to get passage booked on the queen . 
the ink on your divorce isn &apos;t dry .  your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy ,  michael francis .  .  .  was in some trouble with the reno police over some petty theft that you don &apos;t even know about . 
is kay coming ? 
anyone not in your family ,  is a stranger .   believe me ,  when trouble comes ,  your country won &apos;t take care of you . 
oh .   mikey ,  what &apos;s up ?   i &apos;m totally in the dark . 
i never met them . 
how is your wife ,  fredo .  .  . your marriage ? 
then i &apos;m going to confide in you; trust you with something . 
tonight we &apos;ve been invited to a reception at the presidential palace; to bring in the new year .  you and i will go in a special car that &apos;s being sent .   they &apos;ll have cocktails .  .  .  then dinner ,  and a reception with the president .   when it &apos;s over ,  it will be suggested that you take questadt and his friends from washington to spend the night with some women .   i &apos;ll go home alone in the car; and before i reach the hotel ,  i &apos;ll be assassinated . 
the same man who tried in nevada .  .  .  hyman roth ,  not pentangeli . 
i was kept pretty much in the dark .  i didn &apos;t know all that much . 
he &apos;s not the same as when i met him . 
what do you mean gone ? 
tom isn &apos;t going to sit in with us ,  johnny .   he only handles specific areas of the family business .   tom ? 
i asked about fredo ? 
was it a boy or a girl ? 
does she blame it on me ?   the baby ? 
how did they get their hands on pentangeli ? 
i want it met . 
i got to ask questions ,  tom ,  there &apos;s three million dollars cash in that pouch; mike is gone and i have no word from him . 
you paid off thirty grand i never owed . 
senator ,  my client would like to read a statement for the record . 
anthony ,  daddy &apos;s busy . 
on a plane back to sicily . 
that &apos;s all .   you see ,  in sicily ,  in the old days .  .  .  there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative .  .  .  only one .   if he was a traitor . 
kay ,  i told you .  .  . 
i won &apos;t let you leave !   christ ,  do you think i &apos;m going to let you leave . 
if that &apos;s what it takes; then yes ,  i will . 
sit down ,  this is almost over .   you follow the baseball games ? 
you have to be careful what you say in front of the others .  .  .  they frighten easy .   it &apos;s always been that way ,  most men frighten easy . 
then you have to trace it .   michael ,  people here look at me as a reliable man .   i can &apos;t afford not to be looked on as a reliable man .   but you know all that; there &apos;s nothing you can learn from me .   you shouldn &apos;t have to put up with a sick old man as a partner . 
not good . 
the hotel &apos;s registered owners are one jacob lawrence ,  and sidney barclay ,  both beverly hills attorneys .   in reality it &apos;s split between the old lakeville road group from cleveland ,  and our friend in miami .   he takes care of others outside the country ,  you know who i mean .   meyer klingman runs the store ,  and does all right ,  but i &apos;ve been instructed to tell you ,  that if you move him out ,  our friend in miami will go along with you . 
do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of new york . 
the rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages ,  spitting in my face ,  because they &apos;re backed by the jew in miami .

this was my father &apos;s old study .  when i was a kid ,  we had to be quiet when we played near here .  when i was older ,  i learned many things from him here .   i was happy that this house never went to strangers; first clemenza took it over ,  and then you .   my father taught me ,  in this room ,  never to act until you know everything that &apos;s behind things .   never .   if hyman roth sees that i interceded with you in the rosato brothers &apos; favor ,  he &apos;ll think his relationship with me is still sound .   i &apos;m going somewhere to meet him tomorrow .   we have friends in some very important business that we &apos;re making .   do this for me; you make the peace with the rosato brothers on their terms .   let the word out that i forced you; you &apos;re not happy wit hit ,  but acquiesced ,  just because of me .   it will get back to hyman roth .   do this ,  frankie .   you can trust me .

i &apos;ve gotten to know someone who &apos;s famous .

i returned recently from a stay in hospital . 
you have the most architectural skull .   and your nose .   very expressive . 
you went to university ? 
what are you suggesting ?   you &apos;ll charge extra if i include a hand or a bit of shoulder . 
do you mind ? 
oh dear .   if one must have a clinical name . 
very well put . 
after that ,  i went out of fashion .  i was no longer able to command the best projects ,  so i walked away .   why should i spend my time working in such a dreadful business ? 
of course ,  they weren &apos;t nearly as bashful .   no ,  this room was once filled with bare buttocks .   and pricks .   hard ,  arrogant pricks  -  - 
mr .  boone .   you &apos;re not due to cut the lawn until wednesday . 
good afternoon ,  clayton .

by the time he was ready to ship out ,  the fighting was over .   he missed out . 
the morning after pearl harbor ,  he drove down to st .  louis to reenlist .   he was so damn excited .  world war ii was going to be his second chance .   they told him he was too old .  .  . fat  .  .  . nearsighted .   said he &apos;d be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family .

but i have no reputation .   i &apos;m as free as the air . 
that &apos;s as good a way as any to describe it .   i &apos;ve seen far worse cases .   you might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane . 
my god .   is the audience to presume that colin and i have done her hair ?   i thought we were mad scientists ,  not hairdressers . 
oh no ,  my dear .   you look absolutely amazing .   there &apos;s no way i can compete with you .   the scene is yours .

what do you do ? 
welcome back !  i &apos;m arlene oslott -  joseph . 
bob .  .  . 
so .  you and debi .  gonna hit that shit again ? 
i want to be an actor . 
basically the same thing .  in a very evolved ,  esoteric way . 
oh i see .  you got your individual slices of hope ,  dignity ,  confidence ,  self - love ,  justice ,  and harmony . 
how long has it been ? 
all right mystery man .  i want some answers .  let &apos;s recap .  spring of  &apos;84 .  two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry .  the girl sits in a seven - hundred dollar prom dress at her father &apos;s house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life .  the boy never shows up ,  until now .  so ,  what &apos;s the question ? 
jesus .  marty .  you &apos;re pathetic .  it sounds like you need a shockabuku . 
which would you rather .  .  .  ? 
soft .  i &apos;ll take the junkie otter ,  clearly !  i &apos;d let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants .  .  .  okay .  would you rather make love to the candied corpse of phyllis diller -  - 
he was trying to kill you ,  right ! 
a sociopath kills for no reason .  i kill for money . 
you went to school with these people . 
i think what you fear martin is domesticity .  it &apos;s the greatest fear that men have who belong to western culture .  it &apos;s centuries old .  like king phillip ,  in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought ,   &quot; well ,  wouldn &apos;t it be great if we hit the road and fought .  .  .  oh .  .  .  the saracens .  &quot;   so he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families . 
how was your day ,  today ,  sir ? 
like a union ? 
it &apos;s a free - market evolution .  you &apos;ll wake up to it .  .  .  c &apos;mon kid .  we used to run together when you were a rookie .  i don &apos;t want to run against you .  this thing &apos;s real .  everybody &apos;s in . 
well .  .  .  i have to take this over to debi . 
here &apos;s the news :  he hasn &apos;t been in portugal since  &apos;90 .  i know that from the file .  why don &apos;t you read the file ,  man ? 
you &apos;re wrong .  look at his face . 
and not show it to me .  ever again . 
they were very upset . 
you have . 
i &apos;ll call them and tell them you &apos;re taking your time .  being a professional . 
i imagine that &apos;d be rather difficult . 
no ,  i don &apos;t have one . 
and a leader .  didn &apos;t she meet castro on foreign exchange ? 
god it &apos;s great to see you . 
what the hell happened to you ? 
so it &apos;s not a meaningful symbol ,  or anything .  that badge is just the badge of your company .  if i look suspicious on your customers &apos; property -  -  well ,  under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to ,  ah .  .  .  to shoot me . 
how are you ?  how &apos;s business ? 
well ,  if you could just come for the day .  new york &apos;s only a few hours by plane ,  i &apos;d have you home by dinner .  .  . 
oh no .  she &apos;s here .  i brought him along .  and my daughter ,  too .  we &apos;re staying at peterson &apos;s .  .  . 
doesn &apos;t matter . 
i &apos;ve decided it &apos;s impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat . 
if i can survive rush hour ,  i figure i can handle grizzlies .  .  . 
i thought you lived in chicago ? 
the answer &apos;s no . 
everything under control ? 
this is mr .  booker ,  robert . 
oh .  well ,  what are you going to do ?  you have to go to school ,  honey .  i mean ,  what  -  - 
would you like to see that ? 
did he mention it ? 
you got everything you need ? 
nothing . 
what are you talking about ? 
grace ,  i don &apos;t hate your father . 
listen ,  if .  .  .  if there &apos;s a part of you as parent that .  .  .  that takes pride in your child  -  -  that ,  you can look at them and see something you &apos;ve accomplished as well .  .  .  if that &apos;s wrong ,  then i &apos;m sorry .   but it wasn &apos;t my intention .  i don &apos;t push for me .  i do it for you .  .  .  so you don &apos;t waste half your life feeling like you don &apos;t know where you belong . 
why should they ? 
smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in sheriden .  he won &apos;t be back for three days .  i can &apos;t believe he didn &apos;t want to say goodbye . 
so ,  what ,  uh ,  what train are you taking ? 
what about grace ? 
did you get a hold of that horse guy ? 
no .  it &apos;s ,  uh .  .  .  no ,  i really don &apos;t think it &apos;s a good idea
are you a psychiatrist ?  he said it takes time . 
when are you coming home ? 
well then .  .  .  maybe i will take some time .  .  .  come visit . 
i have so much to tell you . 
nobody &apos;s using it .  silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don &apos;t know her way around that well .  .  . 
well ,  did you ever think about hiring a business manager ? 
i &apos;ll have another round of that spaghetti if may ? 
there &apos;s coffee inside .  .  .  i was just bringing this to tom . 
mm - mm .  i never knew him .  he died before frank and i met .  this here &apos;s .  .  .   frank and tom &apos;s mother and father .  .  .  there &apos;s little frank and tom .  .  . 
you don &apos;t seem to upset ? 
what ? 
i don &apos;t think anybody can make tom do anything he didn &apos;t want . 
maybe we should give him another sedative .

he was shot< / u> .  .  . he was shot .   on his rounds .   and .  .  .  and .  .  .

i don &apos;t get the point of me writing a suicide note when we &apos;ll just be shooting them with blanks .

involved !   christ !   she attached my goddamn paycheck !   child support .  why do you think i can &apos;t afford a lawyer ?   you know what i mean .   why i got a court appointed lawyer instead of a ,  uh ,  more experienced .  .  . 
mister laplante ,  i really want to help you ,  but crazy stories are only going to make it worse .   the d . a .  is asking your bail be set at twenty - five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail .  .  . 
you got a ten year old attorney ,  bernie ? 
it &apos;s never your fault ,  bernie !  never ever !   you screwed up my life ,  now you &apos;re gonna screw up joey &apos;s life ,  but you &apos;re never gonna accept responsibility for anyth -  -

you remember where i said how i was gonna explain about life ,  buddy ?   well ,  the thing about life is .  .  .   it gets weird .   see people are always gonna be talking to you about  &quot; truth .  &quot;  everybody always knows what the truth is ,  like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet .  but what you learn as you get older is ,  there ain &apos;t no truth .  all there is is bullshit  .   layers of it .  one layer of bullshit on top of another .   so what you do in life ,  like when you get older ,  is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that &apos;s your< / u> bullshit ,  so to speak .   you got that ? 
i .  .  .  i know that ,  john .  .  . 
i .  .  .  no .  .  .  i don &apos;t have the right .  .  .  i .  .  . 
you &apos;re doing fine .   you didn &apos;t actually lift me though .   it was more like you supported me . 
hey ,  listen ,  great that you &apos;re a career - fiend ,  i got a wife and family ,  i .  .  . 
how &apos;d it go ? 
we &apos;re gonna feature gale &apos;s cast more .   the trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece .  as long as we have gale and there &apos;s no mystery guy ,  we &apos;re the center of the story .   but if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive .  .  . 
if i gave you the impression i hated him i didn &apos;t mean to .   i .  .  .  i hate the way he behaves< / u> .  .  .  he &apos;s selfish and self - centered and cynical .  .  . 
hi ,  chief .   you like the suicide ? 
 &quot; this is gale gayley for channel four news !  &quot;   incredible .  unbelievable !   for bernie laplante !  he &apos;s a celebrity now ?    &apos;cause he stole paint< / u> ? 
i &apos;m happy that you &apos;re working again .   as long as it comes naturally ,  that &apos;s terrific .  you &apos;ve always liked working with your hands ,  haven &apos;t you ? 
the whole disapproval thing .   if you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else &apos;s potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life  -  -  then you &apos;re back to a life of fear ,  aren &apos;t you ?    -  -  you &apos;re a prisoner to that again ,  and that isn &apos;t much of a life . 
things are beginning to come to a head .   i can feel it .   and i want everything to be perfect . 
yeah ,  maybe you &apos;re right .  everything else is just an excuse .  i &apos;m treating the situation with kid gloves because i &apos;m afraid of losing her . 
oh ,  great .

they don &apos;t expect to get what they &apos;re asking .   let &apos;s make an offer . 
and it &apos;s a shorter commute . 
we &apos;re going to think about it .

i hear things in this house , 
honey ,  i can &apos;t track of all the meals charlie and i have been having .   this is a delicate time .  if it leaks out that i &apos;m jumping ship before i &apos;m set up someplace else i could be out on my ear before i &apos;m ready with nothing .  with nothing< / u> . 
did the cleaning woman come ? 
honey  -  -  i can &apos;t find those large -  size hefty trash bags ! 
who was that ?

huge . 
what &apos;s going on ?   why did he call you macleod ? 
why do you stare at me like that ?

why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern ?   they were wedged in tight .   they couldn &apos;t get a grip on them .   they would have had much more strength pushing on them . 
how could that be ?   people don &apos;t live for three hundred years . 
must you fight him ? 
just a little .   who knows what we &apos;re going to find in there .   it could be a huge excavation .   a little friendly pr never hurt . 
we &apos;re holding the workers down below . 
he &apos;s fine .   he swears he never left his post for a moment .   he heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside .

to our family .

i figured i &apos;d make breakfast . 
everyday i have my friend rick here bring a newly - cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar .   and i award it to a woman of exceptional beauty . 
 .  .  .  let it define you .   whatever it is .  most of the roses die behind the bar .  this is the first i &apos;ve given out for nearly a month . 
oh thank god ,  you &apos;re dead .  .  . 
the security &apos;s actually not that severe . 
they record everything their video surveillance takes in .  .  . 
because i &apos;m tired of not understanding things .   cops ,  mafia ,  and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something ,  which it turns out i really didn &apos;t steal -  - it &apos;s fucked up . 
you bastard .   you fucked my freedom for a lousy job . 
my plan is just beginning .   i &apos;ll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers ,  but i &apos;m afraid the birth of the new british empire can have no witnesses !

i &apos;d love to .

but ,  mrs .  rand  -  - 
but how did you get here ?  what are you doing here ? 
does she suffer ? 
where were you trained ? 
it seems we are having dinner by ourselves ,  miss connell .   but i may as well introduce everyone to you ,  anyway .   there  -  -  in the master &apos;s chair ,  sits the master  -  -  my half - brother paul holland .   but you &apos;ve already met him . 
it is not beautiful . 
i made it clear in my letter to the company .   this is not a position for a frightened girl . 
surely nurses aren &apos;t afraid of the dark ? 
wesley can be very entertaining . 
what you saw tonight  -  -  two brothers at each other &apos;s throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband ?   do you love that ? 
you think i love jessica and want her back .  it is like you to think that  -  -  clean ,  decent thinking . 
you wanted to warn me .  .  . 
don &apos;t ,  paul  -  -  don &apos;t doubt yourself  -  -  don &apos;t make me doubt you . 
i don &apos;t know  -  -  i don &apos;t know -  - 
but i assure you ,  father walters ,  miss connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there . 
an accident at the mill ? 
i &apos;m ,  uh ,  going to bed . 
you all right there ? 
because you like it on your turkey sandwiches .

elena ,  it &apos;s not what you think .  it &apos;s not a big plot .  honestly .  honestly .  i don &apos;t know if you want to go over this now ,  but it &apos;s just something that comes over me .  i don &apos;t feel good about it .  i know i &apos;ve done what i didn &apos;t want to do .  i don &apos;t know  -  - 
yeah .  well ,  we can just  -  -

maybe it &apos;s all for the better ,  you know ?  yesterday ,  at dinner ,  well ,  she hasn &apos;t said anything .  .  .  has she acted funny to you ,  i mean ,  have you noticed anything ? 
listen ,  benjamin hood .  i have obligations that precede your .  .  .  from before you showed up .  one or two ,  you know ,  good - natured encounters ,  that doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m .  .  .  i &apos;m not just some toy for you .  when i remembered some chores i wanted to get done before the party ,  i just did them ,  that &apos;s all ,  because i wanted to do them before i saw jimmy .

well ,  i have to say i don &apos;t have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl .  doesn &apos;t seem entirely safe ,  leaving your car keys around ? 
thanks ,  but  -  -  oh ,  i don &apos;t think so .  it &apos;s been kind of a discouraging evening . 
okay .  shall we clean up around here first ?  do you think it &apos;s all right -  - 
jesus ,  let me make it up to you  -  -  i can do better than that ,  honestly  -  - 
self - realization .  ministering to help people reach their fullest potential .  would you believe me if i told you i want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self - realization ?

typical seventeen year - old .   she went to a party friday night ? 
this murder was in the papers ,  right ?

don &apos;t worry .  he was white trash ,  they come at two a penny .  i dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave ,  licked his wounds clean . 
i know .  it gets cold so fast . 
read her thoughts . 
what have you done to me ?  you &apos;ve condemned me to hell . 
consider yourself lucky .  in paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons .  here all one needs is a pair of fangs . 
i learnt absolutely nothing .  i wasn &apos;t give a choice ,  remember ? 
they know about us .  they see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses . 
what do you imagine you are louis ? 
the girl ,  lestat  - 
why do you do this lestat ? 
evil is a point of view .  god kills ,  indiscriminately ,  and so shall we .  for no creatures under god are as we are ,  none so like him as ourselves . 
i didn &apos;t want to kill her . 
you &apos;ll come home with me louis ?  fro a little while .  .  .  until i am myself again .

they were cut loose .

well 
goodbye . 
we will see who is the first to die . 
i &apos;m here .  the general is here .  you are not alone . 
i have not been on the island in twenty years .  it is changed  -  changed completely .  where are the graves  -  -  the coffins ? 
there was some trouble here the villagers on the mainland  - this island was the focal point of their anger .  they came here broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves . 
good night ,  oliver .

what are you doing ? 
shh it &apos;s all right  -  i &apos;ll be all right . 
thea ,  your choice is a very simple one .  either you want to claim him as your father ,  or you do not . 
what would i be thinking ? 
i &apos;ve always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours  but this ,  cathy  -  -  even i would never have believed it is of you . 
no ,  i want more than that .  i beg you general ,  make sure  -  - drive a knife through my heart  -  -  anything . 
that &apos;s superstition .  that &apos;s something out of old tales  -  -  about the dead who live  -  i &apos;m talking of something else  -  - cataleptic attacks  -  -  apparent death that is not real . 
do you mind if i go with you ? 
it makes me fear her . 
better no general than one carrying the plague . 
i have had command for the last time  -

good afternoon ,  mr .  bailey . 
george ,  can i see you for a second ?

holy mackerel !

you wouldn &apos;t mind living in the nicest house in town ,  buying your wife a lot of fine clothes ,  a couple of business trips to new york a year ,  maybe once in a while europe .  you wouldn &apos;t mind that ,  would you ,  george ? 
oh ,  confound it ,  man ,  are you afraid of success ?  i &apos;m offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year ,  starting today .  is it a deal or isn &apos;t it ? 
sure ,  sure ,  sure .  you go on home and talk about it to your wife . 
oh ,  i don &apos;t know  .   .   .  why not right here ?  you remember that old tool and machinery works ?  you tell your father he can get that for a song .  and all the labor he wants ,  too .  half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down . 
made up your mind yet ? 
well ,  i don &apos;t . 
i &apos;m not very good at this . 
too young or too old ? 
i &apos;ll take it .  and then what ?

i can &apos;t let you take her out .

what else is there to do ? 
you stay here a minute . 
jesus ,  don &apos;t freeze on me .   what about the others ? 
sure ,  sure  -  -  jeff hendricks brought in this camera ,  see ,  from underwater ,  and i didn &apos;t know how to get it open ,  but my brother - in -  law ,  in montauk ,  he works at a hi -  fi store ,  and they sell cameras ,  so he .  .  .  . 
what are you all ,  blind ?   it &apos;s a shark .   look  -  -  teeth ,  jaw ,  gills . 
maybe i don &apos;t make as much money as some bullshit rip - off artists around here ,  but i don &apos;t work the same way . 
look at that : 
okay ,  so that &apos;s it . 
this is a mammal ,  not a fish . 
and sound .

some people . 
whoops ,  almost lost one .   can &apos;t play with the dolphins without skis .  .  .  . 
get a dance yet ? 
maybe it &apos;s gone . 
the wind drift is lateral . 
take a break for a minute ,  okay ? 
what &apos;re we going to do in the mean time ? 
mmmmmm . 
anything .   anything . 
mrs .  brody ,  look  -  -  if he can &apos;t go ,  then you can &apos;t go .   neither of you can go . 
hurry ,  please . 
about damn time . 
it comes here from cable junction .

what &apos;s wrong ? 
heading back ? 
i don &apos;t think she &apos;s such hot stuff .

larry ,  i &apos;m a businessman ,  trying to make a buck like anybody else . 
why don &apos;t you take a rest ,  brian ? 
go on ,  doctor . 
he &apos;s going with you ,  doctor . 
i &apos;ll need more men to look .

till this opens ,  not our wedding . 
look ,  kathryn .   they &apos;re jealous . 
that macho pompous english  -  - 
and what else is bothering you ? 
what do i do now ? 
you know ,  on our honeymoon ,  we should go scuba diving . 
yeah ,  and so will i be if i start swimming in that blackass jungle . 
i &apos;d have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber . 
after this has opened ,  when everything &apos;s settled down ,  you and i are going away .   just the two of us .   no dolphins ,  no sharks ,  no whales ,  no penguins .  just you and me . 
recovering nicely . 
yes .   it &apos;s faster . 
michael ,  come on ,  don &apos;t be silly .  this is the quickest way .   you &apos;re not going to walk all the way around ? 
what do you mean ,  we don &apos;t ? 
somebody better get down there ! 
 .  .  .  i have to go ,  honey .   phillip and i are going down together to kill the shark . 
me . 
i &apos;m sorry . 
three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world &apos;s ever known . 
i will . 
you were quite daring in capturing him .   very skillful indeed . 
well ,  doctor .   you &apos;ve got your shark . 
he &apos;s big as a bloody bus ! 
a piece of pie on sunday . 
musclehead ? 
hi ,  mike . 
 &apos;course they &apos;re also so rich . 
i haven &apos;t seen that much ,  but so far it looks great . 
herpes ? 
i know !   we can take the gondola ride ! 
the space shuttle has landed ! 
i don &apos;t talk that way . 
did you see that ? 
hutton ,  how the hell did you get my crane ? 
you set that thing off down there ,  you don &apos;t know what will happen . 
watch it ,  brody .   you &apos;re ruining the shot . 
i lost a good cameraman in australia last year .   a great white chopped him in half with one bite . 
that &apos;s how they do it ,  you know .  seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely .   teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw . 
thanks .   bullshot . 
the world &apos;s southern most reaches . 
i &apos;ll stay out of your way .   i won &apos;t interfere . 
we see him ,  mike .   between the stadium and the ski show island . 
big bust !   he confiscate their water pistols ? 
he taught us good ,  though ,  didn &apos;t he ,  sean ?   we were lucky to grow up the way we did . 
only children are my favorites .  that means you ,  magee .  .  .  . 
he was such a good - natured kid .  .  .  always going out of his way .  .  .  . 
like mother ,  like son .  .  .  . 
turn it off .  .  .  . 
you knew .  .  .  ? 
where &apos;s my mother ? 
it &apos;ll grow on you . 
i could use a half - dozen more arms  .  .  . i &apos;ve only got two weeks to get this thing finished .  .  .  . 
usually it &apos;s all he talks about .  .  . you mustn &apos;t worry .  .  .  . 
they won &apos;t kill it .  .  .  . 
that .  .  .  . 
that hurt .  .  .  . 
your father was six then .   just like you .  .  .  . 
i put everything in my room .   my teddy bear is joining us . 
i &apos;ll be in to read you a story . 
i will .   i &apos;ll miss you ,  grandma . 
i want you to give up that terrible job . 
oh ,  it looks like my uncle &apos;s .   he taught me how to sail when i was a kid .  .  .  . 
i didn &apos;t mean to start that .  .  .  . 
i &apos;ll be all right ,  michael . 
you &apos;re having a good time .  .  .  . 
flies the plane .  .  .  . 
i don &apos;t know why i &apos;ve told you all this .   i hardly know you . 
i have this overwhelming desire to kiss you ,  ellen brody . 
there &apos;s nothing to be sorry about . 
they had them on the big one .  .  .  . 
i don &apos;t know why i fish here .  .  . never catch anything .  .  . must be a sign under the water .  .  .  &apos;beware ,  hoagie &apos;s here .  .  .  .  &apos;
matt ? 
yeah .  .  .  . 
i wish there was something i could do .  .  .  . 
the stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing .  .  .  . 
how many .  .  .  ? 
money is money .  .  .  . 
he &apos;s just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own .  .  .  . 
oh ,  it &apos;s okay for you ,  but not for me .  .  .  . 
what happened to clarence and .  .  .  ? 
okay .  .  . we got it together .  .  .  . 
how long ? 
i don &apos;t like it .  .  .  .

you want my advice ? 
someone bet me a dollar  .  . 
pig woman agreed to take a test . 
this looks promising  .  .  i think this one could be it ? 
i remember the old bastard &apos;s liver !  i don &apos;t believe you did that .  i had a great sent -  imental attachment to that . 
did i say he did ? 
can &apos;t thank you enough ,  ross  .  . 
what if we need a back up ? 
alright .  i &apos;ll start at the top ,  and work down . 
why did he ask if it was frozen ? 
it could be anyone &apos;s hand .  illeg -  ally disposed of hospital debris  .  . 
vehicle references . 
i may have said some -  thing .  i don &apos;t recall . 
as recent as we have  .  .  what ex -  actly is your interest in amber ?

who told you ? 
good .   they &apos;re all heatseekers !   all of them ,  everybody .  you keep one superstar and they &apos;ll all follow .  there &apos;s no real loyalty ,  and the first person who told me that ,  jerry maguire ,  was you . 
don &apos;t say it .   we &apos;re both ragged out right now . 
you &apos;ve never been alone and you can &apos;t be alone  -  - 
i did the 23 hour nose - route to the top of el capitan in 6 hours !  i can make this work . 
wait .   did i just say  &quot; hon &quot;  to him ? 
no no .  .  . 
oh no .   i &apos;m sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to manhattan beach ,  taking that left down to little tiny waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic ,  and your life flashes before your eyes ,  but  -  -  hey ,  i &apos;ve obviously had too much coffee and all  -  -  here &apos;s my sister laurel to pick us up .   thanks ,  though .  bye . 
that took guts . 
dorothy ,  let me tell you something ,  we are back .  we are so very very back .   i re - signed cush .  we &apos;re set . 
it &apos;s all going to work .   we &apos;re going to save the world . 
happy for us .  .  .  okay .   here &apos;s the number .  404 - 453 - 2222 . 
jesus ,  it &apos;s a real gash ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
sorry .   uh ,  let me see ,  have a seat .  i &apos;ll get you some aloe vera for that cut too . 
 -  -  especially one like this . 
it was laziness1 my whole breakup with avery .  you know that thing you say ,   &quot; it &apos;s nobody &apos;s fault .  &quot;  it &apos;s one of the great lies ,  right ?  someone is always to blame  -  -  if you go for it ,  go for it like you do a job ,  work at it  -  - 
oh god . 
it &apos;s my fault . 
this used to be my specialty .  i was good in a living room .   send me in there ,  i &apos;ll do it alone .  and now i just .  .  .  i don &apos;t know .  .  .  but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life ,  it wasn &apos;t complete ,  wasn &apos;t nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete ,  because i couldn &apos;t share it with you .   i couldn &apos;t hear your voice ,  or laugh about it with you .   i missed my wife .   we live in a cynical world ,  and we work in a business of tough competitors ,  so try not to laugh  -  -   i love you .   you complete me . 
you know how much those well child exams cost  -  - 
wait .  where is he ? 
he just lost his best client .   he called from the plane .   i invited the guy over . 
first you gotta tell me something . 
oh yes .   jerry maguire !   my agent !  this is a fierce ,  loving individual ,  i love this man ,  he is love ,  he is about love  -  -  my ambassador of kwan . 
not right now ,  jerry . 
apparently ,  denver wanted to deal with him instead of you . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  i  -  - 
now .   wait .   you didn &apos;t actually sign with sugar ,  did you ?  tell me you didn &apos;t sign .   because i &apos;m still sort of moved by your  &quot; my word is stronger &apos;n oak &quot;  thing  -  - 
see this jacket i &apos;m wearing ?   you like it ?   i don &apos;t really need it ,  because i &apos;m cloaked in failure .  i lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft .  they will teach my story to other agents on  &quot; do not do this &quot;  day in agent school .  why ?  let &apos;s recap .  because a hockey player &apos;s kid made me feel like a superficial jerk ,  i had two slices of bad pizza ,  went to bed ,  grew a conscience and wrote a 25 - page manifesto of doom ! 
i &apos;m out here for you !   you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be me out here for you .  it is an up - at - dawn pride - swallowing seige that i will never fully tell you about !  okay ?  !  help me help you help me help you . 
that &apos;s an answer . 
thanks for coming . 
bobbi fallon .   bpi .   i &apos;m producing the coke commercials for the playoffs . 
i &apos;m sorry what i said back there . 
i &apos;m fine .   what &apos;s up ? 
you wanted smaller . 
and then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and i love the zoo .  do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo ? 
i don &apos;t see any . 
he &apos;s gonna have nothing left for next season .   they &apos;re letting him kill himself . 
he should have kept his head tucked down . 
after what you &apos;ve seen today ,  you really think your son could be alive ? 
you look good . 
what did you say ! 
i &apos;m sorry amanda .  i am .  and i &apos;m sorry for the things i said about him . 
eric !  are you here ? 
i don &apos;t remember
my own kid was right in front of me and i didn &apos;t do a damn thing . 
he &apos;s probably has a better chance by the coast as it is .  figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island .   right ? 
how would you classify it ? 
alan ! 
hmm ? 
you remember the sounds they made ? 
they &apos;ll never make it .  i mean ,  they can &apos;t manage when the cable goes out . 
dr .  grant if you &apos;d just sit tight ,  we &apos;ll explain this all in a jiffy . 
we needed somebody who knew the lay of the land .  somebody who &apos;d been to this island before . 
how did you know ? 
sorry .   we were saying ? 
 &quot; minimal &quot;  is too much .    it has to be light ,  it has to be strong  -  - 
i &apos;m not going ,  john . 
oh  -  - 
well ,  i do ,  and she &apos;s fantastic .  she &apos;ll take you to the museum ,  maybe to a movie if you play your cards right .   you &apos;re going to have a fantastic time . 
you know ,  at the bus stop .   with the hair ? 
i don &apos;t care about the trials ,  i want to be with you .   i could be your research assistant ,  like i was in austin . 
carnivores hunt near stream beds .   do you want to set up base camp or an all - you - can - eat people bar ? 
where do you think you &apos;re going ?  ! 
what kind of gun is that ? 
what ? 
we made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries . 
trespassing ,  sabotage  -  -  you could go to jail just for being here ,  did you know that ? 
do you see any family resemblance here ? 
 ?  ! 
no . 
head for the roof ! 
a statistical phenomenon .   says everything in the world goes in streaks .   it &apos;s real ,  you see it everywhere  -  -  in weather ,  in river flooding ,  in baseball ,  in blackjack ,  in stock markets .   once things go bad ,  they tend to stay bad .   bad things cluster .   they go to hell together . 
no more smoking .   we leave no scent of any kind .   no hair tonics ,  no cologne ,  seal all our food in plastic bags .   we will observe and document ,  but we will not interact . 
oh ,  god . 
oh ,  please .   how am i supposed to keep a straight face when  -  -    -  -  johnny cash here tells me i &apos;m going to skull island ? 
 -  -  way we could safely  -  - 
give it more morphine ! 
i found a way to re - route through the program .   i &apos;m turning the cars around in the rest area loop . 
the lysine contingency  -  it &apos;s intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island ,  but we could use it now .   dr .  wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism .  animals can &apos;t manufacture the amino acid lysine .   unless they &apos;re continually supplied with lysine by us ,  they &apos;ll go into a coma and die . 
how long will this take ? 
i have samples all over the kitchen .  
malcolm &apos;s okay for now .   i gave him a shot of morphine . 
carousel . 
you know ,  if you really wanted to scare the kid you could &apos;ve just pulled a gun on him . 
well ,  not one of those ,  well yeah ,  a possibly one at some point could be a good thing .   what &apos;s so wrong with kids ? 
and what are those ? 
it &apos;s just the two raptors ,  right ?   you &apos;re sure the third one &apos;s contained ? 
ellie ,  get the gun !   try to reach the gun ! 
dr .  grant ! 
do you see anything ? 
alan ?  ! 
that &apos;s right .   will break through . 
what do you call a blind dinosaur ? 
come on ,  try some .   take a bite . 
it &apos;s a bit of a climb .   you guys think you can make it ? 
cloning from what ?  !   loy extraction has never recreated an intact dna strand ! 
what &apos;s to be scared about ?   it &apos;s just a little hiccup in the power . 
blood temperature feels like high eighties . 
ah  -   -  they &apos;re here . 
mr .  hammond ,  i &apos;ve decided not to endorse your park . 
tim !   lex ! 
dad  -   -  dad  -   - 
he left us !   he left us ! 
it &apos;s safe . 
hear that ?   are you hearing this ? 
what &apos;s that ? 
let &apos;s go ! 
but this is nature !   why not give an extinct species a second chance ?  !   i mean ,  condors .  condors are on the verge of extinction  -   -  if i &apos;d created a flock of them on the island ,  you wouldn &apos;t be saying any of this !   have anything to say at all ! 
i don &apos;t think there &apos;s been any debate .   there &apos;s no debate .  .  . my mistakes .  .  .  . 
i don &apos;t know ,  i don &apos;t know .   i &apos;m sorry  -   - 
hey lex ,  ahhhchooo !   hey lex ,  com here . 
that &apos;s not funny . 
hello ? 
okay .  .  .  well .  .  .  i think it &apos;s this way .  .  . 
hello ? 
that &apos;s right .  .  .  it .  .  .  it came right out of his chest .  .  . 
now .  .  .  i think the video store &apos;s open for another couple of hours .  let &apos;s go . 
you think that &apos;s going to work ? 
 &quot; zombie sluts from beyond the grave .  &quot; 
great .  is that what you &apos;re going to say when i put you on the stand ? 
oh ? 
no need .  i &apos;m self - diagnosed .  i have severe nympholepsy .  .  .   and i &apos;m a bed - wetter . 
oh ? 
the mother said the boy hadn &apos;t slept for over three _months_ .  a physical examination showed dilated pupils ,  temperature of one - oh - two ,  blood chemistry highly imbalanced .  .  . 
well ,  that &apos;s it .  he &apos;ll be asleep in a few minutes ,  but his first rem - cycle probably won &apos;t kick in for another hour or so .   is there a place we can get something to eat in this town ? 
see this ? 
tomorrow .  if you can clear it with the sheriff &apos;s department . 
what are you doing ? 
so krueger thinks jason &apos;s dead .  .  .  leaves him in the lake .  .  .  but the boy actually wakes up on the shore .  .  .  crawls off into the woods .  .  .  where he lives the rest of his life alone . 
how long will the effect last ? 
ten minutes .  .  . 
heralds of a new age  -  -  does that sound immodest ? 
preliminary investigations may already be underway . 
i &apos;ve read your stories .   they &apos;re fantastic . 
 -  -  i &apos;m flattered ,  of course ,  to be considered a friend  -  -  even without knowing all the details .    -  -  to see such determination is reward enough for me . 
 -  -  oh ,  yes ,  determination runs in the family . 
i &apos;m trying to find things out myself  -  -  that &apos;s the whole point . 
oh ,  don &apos;t they ?   i think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own . 
it &apos;s what i &apos;m paid to do . 
you &apos;ve been with the firm for nearly nine years .   you &apos;ve done your work diligently ,  there are no complaints on that score .   but there &apos;s more to the job than the work  -  -  there are other people to consider  -  -  and frankly ,  kafka ,  we eel your social situation could bear improving . 
i usually take lunch by the river . 
well ,  i  -  - 
what ? 
the police would know the difference ,  wouldn &apos;t they ? 
 -  -  i don &apos;t know the musil district . 
ah  -  -  we &apos;re back to the  &quot; authorities &quot;  you spoke of . 
i nominated you as a possible candidate .   you were eduard &apos;s good friend .   he read me some of your work . 
burgel doesn &apos;t like anybody ! 
i know how they reward failure .  if they saw this i &apos;d be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon  -  -  with all the others . 
kafka  -  -  is that your real name ? 
maybe it &apos;s true then what she said . 
do you ? 
i didn &apos;t realize you &apos;d been here that long . 
still ,  we &apos;re probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings . 
through a very unfortunate  -  -  and i might add extremely rare  -  -  mishap ,  a document intended for the one department was sent to the other .   and for the first time  -  -  though your friend wasn &apos;t aware of it  -  -  two and two could have been put together to make one . 
i believe we &apos;ve exceeded his expectations . 
may i ask where your two warders are ? 
it &apos;s not our fault .   we &apos;re naturally nervous . 
we &apos;ve been together too long .   his personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa . 
i understand he was wounded in the lung . 
there &apos;s no hard feelings ,  mr denham !  i just want to come to the island with you ! 
what have you got there ? 
out !  out !  all of you !  we have been issued with an exclusive permit  - 
where do i charter a boat ? 
yeah !  life &apos;s looking pretty damn good at the moment . 
did you see her ? 
holy shit !  look at the size of that ! 
are you gonna start it up ? 
bree  -  -  honey  -  please ,  we &apos;re waiting for someone .

can &apos;t we talk together reasonably ,  just  -  -  ordinarily ?   i know you &apos;re expecting some kind of  -  -  extravagant behavior ,  but believe me  -  -  do you believe me ?   -  - 
i &apos;m not going to hurt you ,  absolutely ,  i &apos;m not . 
excuse me miss daniel ? 
what about ? 
you remind me of my uncle . 
well could i have them back now hon ?   -  -  those tape recordings you &apos;ve got downstairs  -  -  ok ?   -  -  and if you want you can have a good time and i &apos;ll have a good time and -  - 
is that how you get most of your dates ?  someone gives your name to someone else ? 
klute ,  tell me ,  what &apos;s your bag ?  are you a talker ,  or a button man or a doubler ,  or maybe you like them very young  -  -  children  -  -  or get your chest walked around with high - heeled shoes ,  or have us watch you tinkle ?  or  -  - 
i thought you could trick me for those tapes .  don &apos;t you get lonely in that little green room ?  or let me get you someone; i have terrific friends ,  wild . 
you &apos;ve changed your mind ?  you do want to play ? 
rounds ,  what are they ?   -  -  don &apos;t watch me ,  keep talking . 
it &apos;s kind of late . 
oh ,  don &apos;t be a doo - doo . 
you asked if there was anything more you could help me with . 
i &apos;ve checked the records of jane mckenna &apos;s death  -  -  i can &apos;t get anything special .  but frank ligourin had another girl you said ,  besides mckenna and you . 
you &apos;re right ,  i don &apos;t understand .  explain it to me .   you were scared .  arlyn page ,  that scared you .  well it should; that &apos;s death .  so what did you do ,  you ran straight for it ,  death .  ligourin kills women . 
no ,  you can find some other way .   explain it to me .  bree ,  show me any sense to  -  - 
i &apos;m still scared .   i mean different but still .   look ,  i made it very clear from the start ,  you &apos;re a yokel ,  you don &apos;t excite me ,  you don &apos;t even interest me ,  and so i only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed ? 
oh jesus .  oh jesus . 
ah ,  schmendrick  -  -  what &apos;s the scam ? 
i called trina . 
what ? 
look ,  why should it be yes or no ?  can &apos;t we keep it going and see ?  i mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see .  people do that ,  that &apos;s realistic . 
sorry we had to meet here .  but i &apos;m pressed for time . 
i &apos;m on my way to chicago .  very important meeting tonight .  well  -  -  any new developments ? 
i &apos;m sorry .  i don &apos;t understand . 
you said he was no possible connection with tom .  the page girl told you that ,  not tom . 
you were hired to look for tom . 
sounds to me you better shake him again .  put him in a spot he has to do something more  -  -  but this time give him a time and a place to do it . 
well ? 
think this is our guy ? 
it &apos;s damn lucky you didn &apos;t have the dossier on cable here . 
mr .  kramer ? 
where is the child ? 
what do you have here ,  billy ? 
that &apos;s kim .  .  . and this one &apos;s thelma and that &apos;s mrs .  willewska and this is daddy and that &apos;s batman and over there is robin . 
what do you like best about her ? 
greatest . 
show . 
huh ?  .  .  . oh god .  .  . what time is it ? 
when is mommy coming back ? 
when is mommy coming back ? 
will she pick me up after school ? 
mom ,  i mean dad .  .  . 
owwww .  .  . you &apos;re hurting me .  .  .  you &apos;re hurting me .  .  . i hate you  .  .  . i hate you .  .  . 
sleep tight .   don &apos;t let the bedbugs bite .  .  . 
see .   that &apos;s my name . 
wow !   that &apos;s neat .    can i sit in it ? 
daddy !   you &apos;re home early .   did you get fired again ? 
because .  .  . well ,  that &apos;s what he does .   he &apos;s a very powerful man . 
no ,  counselor ,  i &apos;m going to over -  rule you on this line of questioning . 
did you wish to ? 
mrs .  kramer ,  do you love your child ? 
objection ,  your honor !   counsel is harassing the witness . 
ted was a good worker .   but ,  ah .  .  .   .  .  .  after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own ,  things started to change .  look ,  i know he had problems ,  i understand that .   i &apos;ve got problems ,  everybody &apos;s got problems .   but i &apos;ve got a shop to run ,  i can &apos;t let that kind of thing get in the way .  .  .   i guess i felt that ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office . 
there might be something at j .  walter thompson .   but .  .  .    .  .  . i don &apos;t think they &apos;re really serious .   the position &apos;s been open for two months and .  .  .   they may just be on a fishing expedition .   i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll be much happier if you wait until after the first -  - 
in all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way . 
somewhere in between . 
i thought you might just like to know that at five - fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the fire and ice account by revlon . 
ted ,  you &apos;re not listening to me .  it &apos;s over ,  finished . 
no you didn &apos;t .   you didn &apos;t even ask about billy . 
i &apos;m not taking him with me . 
i am not !   i &apos;m a terrible mother !  i &apos;m an awful mother .   i yell at him all the time .   i have no patience .   no .  .  . no .   he &apos;s better off without me .   ted ,  i &apos;ve got to go .  .  . i &apos;ve got to go . 
ted ,  listen to me .  .  . you and i ,  we had a really crappy marriage -  -   look ,  don &apos;t get so defensive ,  okay ?   it was probably as much my fault as it was yours .  .  .  anyway when i left i was really screwed up -  - 
i &apos;m sorry .  .  . i just mentioned it in passing .   i never thought he &apos;d use it . 
listen ,  don &apos;t let it get you down .   you &apos;re going to be fine . 
mr .  kramer ,  would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child . 
what if i fight it ? 
i &apos;ll take my chances . 
don &apos;t worry .   i plan to have something within twenty - four hours ,  john . 
then how come she never said anything like that to me ? 
y &apos;know something thelma -  - you are the typhoid mary of divorce .  i mean it .   joanna and i never had any trouble until you and charley split up . 
you &apos;re sure ? 
hey ,  that &apos;s terrific . 
huh .  .   . hello ? 
please ,  come ,  holiness . 
you must also do something about the public meetings .  i see this ,  memorandum circulating ,  with tibetan grievances . 
we bring greetings from chairman mao . 
have you heard the terms of the seventeen point agreement ? 
he has been imprisoned ,  here in the potala ,  holiness . 
of the tibetan delegations sent abroad ,  all have been turned away . 
oh ,  no .  where will he go ? 
your father had been very sick . 
this many ? 
can i save the sheep from going to the market ?  so they don &apos;t die . 
yes .  as a free country .  but our attempts have proven futile .  we continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the chinese . 
quite simple .  yes .  good . 
one country did sponsor the resolution .  a land called  &quot; el salvador &quot;  . 
your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in lhasa . 
it is unlikely .  america ,  perhaps .  there is great anti - communist feeling in america . 
i am scared . 
they will take lhasa next . 
ah ,  dalai lama ,  thank you for coming so late . 
well ,  some say .  it &apos;s not for you to worry about .  another will be chosen . 
i turn you over again ,  today ,  lhamo .  one day ,  you will not be able to come running to us . 
this little brother was terribly sweet .  when he died ,  my mother was so sad .  a lama said to her ,  before the little brother was laid out for burial ,  take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin .  he will come back to you ,  you will see .  so ,  my mother did this ,  and a few years later ,  a new boy was born . 
i want to be a shepherd ,  taking those goats and cows out to the hillside . 
you must study very hard ,  do not neglect the holy things during this time . 
you are unharmed ? 
you can &apos;t take a cow by eminent domain . 
ma &apos;am ,  how could you not report this ?   he puts human life at risk and -  - 
i &apos;ll sue you . 
they &apos;ve been migrating north ,  kelly ,  this lake connects to the ocean ,  -  - 
could she< / u> stay ,  we &apos;ve tentatively scheduled intercourse . 
i keep telling you ,  they can< / u> come on land ,  i don &apos;t wanna wake up in the middle of the night -  - 
i brought a pork chop ,  maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck . 
this is a setback . 
asia ?   how .  .  .  how could he get here ? 
what &apos;s that ? 
where is he ?  ! 
keep enough tension to hold him up ,  hector ,  we don &apos;t know if he can swim . 
hector .   what you just did .  .  .  there was at least some sort of a death wish going on . 
what ? 
i &apos;m okay . 
why are you here ?   really . 
the museum of natural history doesn &apos;t send out investigators to -  - 
baby crocs ? 
are< / u> you okay ? 
i couldn &apos;t believe .  .  .  did you see the size of that thing &apos;s mouth ? 
ow< / u> .   shit . 
you &apos;re having the best time of your life ,  aren &apos;t you ? 
thing we can lift it ? 
we gotta get to hector !  ! 
they won &apos;t be here till at least noon .   we got a few hours to kill . 
if you get a safe shot .  .  . 
he just came up screaming . 
the lake was dead calm until up he came .   the tooth is in there . 
this .  .  .  how long did this attack go on for ? 
and this is how he came to the boat ? 
you hurt his feelings .   i think you should go apologize . 
he said he knew it when he looked into their eyes . 
what< / u> ?   i don &apos;t even know< / u> the guy . 
what is this ? 
i &apos;m not going to maine ,  i won &apos;t even go west of forty - third street -  - 
i never do field work and even if i did ,  maine< / u> ,  to look at a tooth of a dinosaur< / u> who bit somebody ,  couldn &apos;t you dream up something -  - 
you don &apos;t know what to say ,  lucky for you action speaks louder than words . 
damn ,  clarice ,  how &apos;d you make me ? 
 &quot; desperately random .  &quot;  what does he mean ? 
agent starling !  telephone ! 
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s a great town ,  dr .  chilton ,  but my instructions are to talk to lecter and report back this afternoon . 
lecter carved up nine people  -  that we &apos;re sure of  -  and cooked his favorite bits .  we &apos;ve tried to study him ,  of course  -  but he &apos;s much too sophisticated for the standard tests .  and my ,  does he hate us !  thinks i &apos;m his nemesis .  .  .  crawford &apos;s very clever ,  isn &apos;t he ?  using you . 
what you &apos;re doing ,  miss starling ,  is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview ,  and refusing to share information with me .  for the third time ! 
your instructions are what i &apos;m giving you now .  jack crawford answers to the director ,  and the director answers to me .  my god ,  crawford &apos;s losing it .  .  .  !  he shouldn &apos;t even be on this ,  with his wife sick as she is .  .  .  how the hell did you get in here ,  anyway ?  he gave you  -  what ?  some kind of special id ?  let &apos;s have it . 
not to my knowledge .  privacy is a great concern to my customers .  but ,  if you say this is an fbi matter .  .  . 
mr .  yow ?  oh mr .  yow .  .  .  ?  it looks like somebody is sitting in this car . 
mrs .  lippman had a son ,  maybe he could help you .  i have his card somewhere .  do you mind stepping inside ,  while i looks for it ? 
be very careful with hannibal lecter .  dr .  chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him .  do not deviate from them ,  for any reason .  you tell him nothing personal ,  starling .  believe me ,  you don &apos;t want hannibal lecter inside your head .  .  .  just do your job ,  but never forget what he is . 
what do you see ,  starling ? 
the other girls are in the ground .  exhumations are upsetting for the families .  i &apos;ll do it if i have to ,  but  - 
if we act too anxious ,  he &apos;ll make us wait .  he &apos;ll let the senator keep hoping ,  day after day ,  until catherine finally washes up .  that &apos;d be the most fun of all . 
ohio is cold ground .  picked over ,  ten months ago .  our people worked it ,  so did the locals . 
and there &apos;s no way  -  no natural way  -  these could &apos;ve wound up in the bodies ? 
is that a pretty good job ,  fbi agent ? 
doctor ,  we have a hard problem in psychological profiling .  i want to ask for your help with a questionnaire . 
i have no doubt of it . 
five .  .  .  so far . 
i &apos;ll tell you if you &apos;ll look at this form .   it started as a bad joke in kansas city homicide .  they said .  .  .  this one likes to skin his humps . 
and the questionnaire .  .  .  ? 
i would not have had that happen to you .  discourtesy is  -  unspeakably ugly to me . 
your bleeding has stopped . 
your first lie to me ,  clarice .  how sad .  tell me  -  do you think crawford wants you ,  sexually ?  true ,  he &apos;s much older ,  but  -  do you think he visualizes .  .  .  scenarios ,  exchanges .  .  .  ?  fucking you ? 
quid pro quo ,  doctor . 
dr .  lecter ,  there &apos;s no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence .  transsexuals are very passive . 
no .  tell me why . 
dr .  lecter ,  you find out everything .  you couldn &apos;t have talked with this  &quot; william rubin &quot;  ,  even once ,  and come out knowing so little about him .  .  .  you made him up ,  didn &apos;t you ? 
we don &apos;t reckon time the same way ,  clarice .  this is all the time you &apos;ll ever have . 
what did you do ? 
so you ran away .  .  . 
i won &apos;t waste your time and catherine &apos;s time bargaining for petty privileges .  clarice starling and that awful jack crawford have wasted far too much already .  i only pray they haven &apos;t doomed the poor girl .  .  .  let me help you now ,  and i &apos;ll trust you when it &apos;s all over . 
why didn &apos;t you bury those people ? 
he did ? 
mr poe ? 
will you go back to england ? 
some say that &apos;s the way of it . 
my god ,  alice . 
he knew the penalty for breaking regulations .   he ought to pay without sending you to beg . 
then you &apos;re assigned to fort william henry ? 
i don &apos;t understand ! 
any powder ? 
the crown  &quot; negotiating &quot;  the terms of service ? 
we must .  .  .  stop .  .  .  soon .  women are .  .  .  tired .   you .  .  .  understand ? 
please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress .  under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material .  .  .  mere chance has allowed me to array against you .  .  . 
honor that is freely accorded to courage ,  may be refused obstinacy .  .  .  these hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and i am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves .   is webb really en route and montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before british reinforcements arrive ? 
the mask is because you think it might be .  .  . catching ? 
why sixpack ? 
some say that &apos;s why we &apos;re basically hairless ,  for less water resistance ,  faster swimming speeds .  .  . 
be careful with it . 
i &apos;ve been looking at the duty roster .  .  . at the shack hours outstanding .  .  . 
that &apos;s an order ! 
look at my foot ,  sir !   this bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk ! 
that &apos;s great .   now let &apos;s move 35 degrees southwest . 
sixpack ? 
whatever made you want to do a tour down here ? 
i guess i figured if i was in their shoes that &apos;s what i would &apos;ve done . 
they know ,  don &apos;t they ? 
we &apos;re on backup air . 
what &apos;s wrong with it ? 
shut up ,  all of you . 
twenty minutes .  .  . 
thank you ,  martin . 
well ,  according to maritime law ,  you ,  as commander of the shack have the authority to dispose of the body .   however ,  the company doesn &apos;t want you to do that . 
but it &apos;s a delay !   how long ?  a day ?   two days ?  ! 
i &apos;m telling you ,  it &apos;s the suits ! 
typhoon ?  ! 
how &apos;d you do that ? 
the monster appears to be a genetic aberration .  .  . 
who &apos;s the best power forward in the nba .  .  . jameson ? 
it saw us ! 
my pocket .   check my pocket ,  will ya ,  honey ? 
at the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it &apos;s hit him hard . 
drachmas ,  i hope .  i would feel safer with a chicken drumstick .  they could do more harm than good . 
yes ? 
of course you will ,  sweetheart .  this one ,  search this one .  ed finds the keys without any trouble . 
well ? 
what &apos;s that ? 
no ,  i asked you to give me a refreshing drink .  i wasn &apos;t expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang - utan in that . 
antiques ?  what the fuck do we know about antiques ?  we rob post offices and steal cars ,  what the fuck do we know about antiques ? 
and jd is his dad ,  and owns the whole property ? 
i hate these southern shites . 
the boys had  &apos;em .  i know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them ? 
son ?

we gotta get those guns . 
i want you to search the house for bugs .  i mean i want you to strip it . 
what they like then ? 
my neck ,  dog .   that &apos;s the last bag ? 
do you want me to take his leg off ?  where &apos;s the fourth ? 
and we will just have to find out who &apos;s going to be carrying them . 
that &apos;s it all done ,  we are off . 
well ,  what &apos;s going on ? 
it &apos;s pay day ,  ain &apos;t it ? 
and ? 
i thought you were going to leave me out there all day . 
what are you doing ,  plank ? 
of course you will look mean ,  tom ,  you will look really scary . 
look .  go on ,  look . 
you would take a pain n the arse full stop . 
how many feet ? 
chill ,  winston ,  it &apos;s me and charlie can see it &apos;s me ,  so what &apos;s the problem ? 
you went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer .  alarm bells are ringing ,  willy . 
and those stupid girls who hang out with them -  - 
joanie orozco &apos;s telling the whole school she &apos;s like desperately in love with santo guerra .

he had the club out on the old trail road -  - 
you had to deal with him in running the club . 
no .  is he sick ? 
buddy was more a part of the big picture -  - county political machine ,  chamber of commerce ,  zoning board if i kept those people happy ,  he was pretty much on my side .   whenever somebody thought -  - they start up another bar for the black  folks ,  they &apos;d be -  - how should i put this ?  they &apos;d be officially discouraged . 
what ? 
she finally got in -  - 
i could name five girls at school who have one just like it -  - 
morning ,  sheriff . 
you built our patio while you  were on the county ?

fernando did okay ,  and he dropped out -  - 
it can happen so sudden ,  can &apos;t it ?  being left out on your own . 
i should get back . 
i look at my kids in school -  - tenth ,  eleventh graders .  that &apos;s who we were .  children . 
i mean what did we know about anything ? 
when nando died -  - it was so sudden -  - i was kind of in shock for awhile .  then i woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and i didn &apos;t have any idea what to do with it . 
how come it feels the same ? 
so what are we gonna do about this ? 
there &apos;s nothing on the walls .  no pictures -  -

i know you ? 
i gotta be careful .   if vinovich sees me talking to you .   he &apos;s an asshole ,  but he &apos;s a powerful asshole . 
i hear mrs .  swann &apos;s quite a babe . 
i could have lost my fucking hands . 
that &apos;s because he knew .   he &apos;d seen these files and knew . 
anything ? 
like the look of these ?   i made them myself ,  to set him free . 
if he was just a man like me ,  then no .   but he &apos;s not . 
he &apos;s with us .  .  . 
we don &apos;t share our lives the way a lot of people do . 
he taught all this to swann ? 
so swann was performing magic .  not illusions ?   and what ?   you thought he should be using it to cure cancer ,  not making millions . 
what then ? 
nothing &apos;s going to happen to you . 
i was so afraid . 
are you sure ? 
 .  .  . yes ? 
don &apos;t look . 
is it finished ? 
valentin ? 
what about me ? 
 .  .  .  they believe you . 
i &apos;m putting in a new illusion tonight .   will you be there ? 
what were you doing up there ? 
tapert .   so ,  now i &apos;ve got tapert ,  butterfield . 
and this butterfield guy -  -

fuck regrettable !   i want to know why . 
nix is dead and buried ,  for fuck &apos;s sake . 
i want to see swann face to face . 
don &apos;t bother . 
she has no real grip on reality . 
you &apos;re drawn to the dark side ,  over and over .   and it &apos;s drawn to you .   you don &apos;t like that . 
the puritan ? 
harry d &apos;amour . 
he knew swann way back .   he says there were a lot of drugs ,  a lot of crazy shit . 
how the fuck do you do that ? 
or murdered ,  like nix . 
maybe he doesn &apos;t see it that way .  maybe he &apos;s digging his way out of the hole you put him right now .   that &apos;s what you &apos;re hiding away from ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
he had something .   he showed me how to bend the rules .   a little levitation .   a few fireworks . 
nobody &apos;s better off this wav ! 
that &apos;s where we &apos;re all going . 
call me tomorrow .

because you &apos;ve got nothing else to live for . 
you know i &apos;ll kill you when we &apos;re done .   i have to .

mr .  kelson ,  what a pleasure to meet you .  i have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable .   i am a fan . 
when your secretary called ,  she made no mention of her coming ,  too . 
but your patient is legally entitled to it . 
dr .  allen ,  could you please tell mr .  kelson what you heard as you tried to enter mr .  birdson &apos;s room ?

what about after ? 
he &apos;s been repeating that since birdson &apos;s exorcism .   i looked in every passage in the bible and there &apos;s nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything . 
and what are you thinking we should do now ? 
i &apos;d appreciate it if you &apos;d put that back . 
but she worships you .   your mother &apos;s dead but your father &apos;s alive . 
you know what ?   you can go .

what &apos;s the matter with you ? 
what ? 
what ? 
yeah .   can &apos;t wait to see him  i just saw quincy . 
i remember when i was eight years old ,  you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal .   all you &apos;d let me and lena do was set the table .   and i guess you and dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas .   and you didn &apos;t say anything .  you just threw the whole meal into some tupper - ware and tossed it in the fridge . 
that &apos;s all you cared about .   i must have played in a thousand games and i can only remember you being to two .

thank you for coming . 
the board of parrish communications  -  is hereby called to order .   our sole order of business is an acceptance of john bontecou &apos;s generous offer and  -  - 
it doesn &apos;t matter . 
in my sleep . 
why yes ,  bill ,  i was saying to quince  -  - 
you &apos;re competitive soul ,  drew .  that &apos;s what makes you a great addi -  tion to the money .   joe is just .  .  .  around . 
what are their feelings ? 
i think it &apos;s time you went home ,  drew . 
i &apos;m not interested in the details .  and i &apos;m not interested in the big picture either .   what i am inter -  ersted in is how my board got conven -  ed behind my back ,  is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with ,  moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish ,  and i am expected to clap for it like a performing seal .   no ,  thank you . 
i &apos;ve already introduced mr .  black to you all . 
yeah . 
i &apos;d like to come ,  too .   see susan strut her stuff .

good morning ,  mr .  parrish . 
c &apos;mon ,  have a drink .   you look like you need one bad as me . 
oh yes ,  i do . 
yeah ,  it &apos;s like you know every inch of each other &apos;s souls  -  -  and then you &apos;re free . 
you think so ?   how do you know ? 
what are your intentions ?   to make little dreams in coffee shops ,  turn a woman &apos;s head ,  and i don &apos;t mind admitting it was turned ,  i liked it ,  but ten hours later i feel like a fool .   i don &apos;t get it .   you ,  my father ,  here in this house ,  the cof -  fee shop ,  it &apos;s making me upset ,  and i don &apos;t like being upset .   who are you anyway ?   and what are you eating ? 
i &apos;ve got plenty of friends . 
goodnight ,  joe . 
joe ,  i &apos;m with drew . 
i wanted to apologize ,  susan  -  - 
why do you love peanut butter so much ? 
no ,  i &apos;m not . 
 -  -  could you ? 
but there &apos;s so much to tell you  -  - 
did i say that ? 
susan  -  - 
that &apos;s it ? 
so there &apos;s nothing between you and susan ? 
if there is anything else ,  don &apos;t hesitate  -  - 
sounds fair enough . 
bill  -  - 
so you understand the concept then .  when you &apos;re busy here ,  your work ,  what your task is ,  is being executed elsewhere . 
how about giving a guy a break ? 
perhaps you would like to wait in my office  -  -  ? 
what i &apos;m trying to say is this is a board meeting and you are not a mem -  ber of the board . 
truly  -  uh  -  splendid . 
dinner ?   absolutely . 
why did you go to the hospital ? 
you &apos;re violating the laws of the universe . 
 -  -  i have the feeling that ,  all in all ,  what i made this voyage for  -  -  has served its purpose . 
what the hell do you care ? 
 -  -  and i &apos;m in love with your daughter . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  bill  -  - 
those were my words ,  bill . 
he is  -  - 
you want me to be your guide  -  -  ? 
excuse me ?   could i say something ? 
please .   talk to me  -  - 
 &apos;the one &apos; to do what ? 
i &apos;m sorry  -  - 
yes what ? 
what question ? 
hi ,  bill  -  - 
 .  .  . what can i say after i say that i &apos;m sorry ?   i zipped when i should &apos;ve zagged ,  i opened my big mouth one too many times ,  everything got all twisted  -  - 
come in ,  joe  -  -  i want to thank you  -  -  okay ,  bill ? 
susan ,  you &apos;re a hell of a woman .  you &apos;ve got a great career ,  you &apos;re beautiful  -  - 
well ,  i wasn &apos;t going to say that  -  - 
that &apos;s for me .   i &apos;m talking about you .   it &apos;s not so much what you say about drew ,  it &apos;s what you don &apos;t say . 
be deliriously happy .   or at least leave yourself open to be . 
thank god . 
are you okay ? 
you know each other ? 
you don &apos;t know anything about joe  -  - 
i don &apos;t know ,  i can &apos;t say  -  - 
if you don &apos;t mind dancing with an old fogey like me . 
why ? 
you &apos;ll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days  -  -

i &apos;m not appealing the decision . 
beg my forgiveness !  beg my wife &apos;s forgiveness before i blow your brains out !

i &apos;m gonna pull it out and i want you to pin it down ,  okay ? 
that &apos;s impossible .   insects don &apos;t .  .  . 
oh ,  my ! 
don &apos;t move now -  - wouldn &apos;t want to hurt this neck -  -   well ,  the other afternoon i was on my way home ,  and there you were ,  leaving the lodge ,  and i wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming . 
you want to read it ? 
i have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage -  - only my editor ,  my agent ,  and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck . 
what &apos;s it about ? 
i thought it was time you two should meet .  paul ,  say hello to my favorite beast in all the world ,  my sow ,  misery . 
yes .  i told you i was your number -  one fan . 
done ? 
then who did ? 
well ,  it does smudge after all -  - isn &apos;t that fascinating ? 
poor dear .  .  .  let &apos;s get you back in bed and i &apos;ll get them for you . 
oh ,  paul ,  can i read each chapter when you finish ?  i can fill in the  &quot; n &quot; s .   will she be her old self ,  now that ian has dug her out ,  or will she have amnesia .  .  .  ? 
to misery . 
did you study decorating ,  or do you just have a flair ? 
when you first came here ,  i only loved the writer part of paul sheldon .  but now i know i love the rest of him too .  as much as misery loves ian .   i know you don &apos;t love me -  - don &apos;t say you do -  - you &apos;re a beautiful ,  brilliant ,  famous man of the world; and i &apos;m .  .  . not a movie star type .  you &apos;ll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you &apos;re someone like me . 
i know you do .  i love you too ,  annie .   and you &apos;re right .  we are meant to be together .  and i know we must die .  but it must be so that misery can live .  we have the power to give misery eternal life .  we must finish the book . 
it was windthorne .  i knew it -  - what does that do to her love for ian ?  -  -    -  - of course ,  if she hadn &apos;t thought windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with ian in the first place .   sorry ,  it &apos;s just that this is so wonderful . 
paul ,  this will be our legacy . 
did i do good ? 
stop -  - stop right here . 
 &quot; there is a justice higher than that of man .  i will be judged by him .  &quot; 
they &apos;re hauling misery into court . 
just leave it ,  all right ? 
i &apos;m a literary agent ,  and i feel like a fool calling you ,  but i think one of my clients ,  paul sheldon ,  might be in some kind of trouble . 
yeah ,  i understand he &apos;s been up here the last six weeks . 
do you have any of those new paul sheldon books ? 
i haven &apos;t been a writer since i got into the misery business -  - 
how i usually find you ,  nyah . 
you won . 
what made you pick that< / i> nag ?   she &apos;d never won a bloody thing . 
god damn it ,  nyah !   why did you do it ?   why did you save that bastard ? 
what are you talking about ? 
where ? 
outrageous .   i won &apos;t let you take control of my company . 
she doesn &apos;t belong here ,  sean .   let her go . 
oh ,  hunt ,  please !  one can &apos;t hold nyah responsible for her actions .  . 
well do you disagree with that ? 
wrong .   all we &apos;ve got to worry about is ambrose .   nyah will take care of nyah . 
it is ,  billy . 
i &apos;m booted up .   go ,  ethan . 
 -  right .  . where is it ? 
if you weren &apos;t going to let me get away with it ,  why did you let me go thru with it ? 
hola .  . 
the only other spook i knew was a liar .  charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth .   he &apos;d lie about his favorite color .   but then i reckon it &apos;s an occupational hazard .   all spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies . 
what &apos;s the population of seville any idea ? 
no .   you can be a thief and have a conscience :   not me .   why did you have to tell me about this !   what do i have to do to get away from this guy ?   when you &apos;re with him ,  he messes about with your head every waking moment .  . even now i &apos;ll be at some out - of -  the - way - place ,  a tin of caviar and a bottle of crystal shows up at the table ,  with two glass ,  god knows how he finds out at any given moment where i am in the world but he does .   and it looks like he &apos;s done it again .   you know his definition of a  true paranoid ? 
ethan ,  you know what frightens me most when i &apos;m with him ?  .  . the thought of never seeing you .  . how are we getting out of here ? 
sorry i didn &apos;t let you know where i was . 
like what ? 
in order to do that ,  i &apos;ve got to figure out how he plans to make money with it . 
i don &apos;t think i can get her to do it . 
not yet .   we did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage . 
yes ,  i believe that &apos;s right . 
but you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the chimera virus .   i &apos;d be very interested to know how ,  after you &apos;d managed its recovery intact ,  it subsequently got destroyed . 
not sure .   some sort of vacation .   i &apos;ll let you know where i &apos;m going . 
sorry it couldn &apos;t be under happier circumstances . 
ethan ,  i keep telling you there &apos;s not a chance of locating nyah til i access the satellite and there &apos;s not a chance of doing that til i get this thing booted up and running !   how much time does she have left ? 
a visit from an old friend . 
fatigued ,  certainly .   but dead is a little extreme .   on the other hand ,  when me dear gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live . 
oh ,  please !   how was i to know they had to be treated with bellerophon within twenty hours ? 
you asked for my help .   you asked< / u> for my< / u> help .  .  . come on .  .  . 
you knew about jim ? 
what ? 
i &apos;m so sorry .   krieger was my call .   i &apos;ve never worked with him .   i &apos;m sorry ,  ethan . 
ethans right behind me .   listen to me jim .   is it such a good idea to kill him ?  we take the money .   ethan takes the blame .   no - one else has seen you alive .  no - one will believe him . 
i dont think so . 
yes . 
correct the actual list is safe at langley .    &quot; golitsyn &quot;  was a lightning rod ,  one of ours . 
may take a little time .  that &apos;s not what claire tells me about you . 
and i get to keep the equipment when we &apos;re done . 
here &apos;s to  you ,  luther .    to being off the disavowed list . 
why ,  may i ask ? 
thanks ,  max .   or is it maxine ? 
how will you make sure job will be there ? 
what sector &apos;s the air conditioning ? 
simple game .   four players .   exfil opens the pocket  -  -    -  -  cyber ops lifts the wallet . 
merci . 
i thought i was going to see max . 
i thought i &apos;d take some now . 
oh ?   what &apos;s the problem ? 
what problem ? 
 -  but you left before i could get there and i could check just so many places .  . 
jim ,  who do you think you &apos;re kidding ?   a doctor &apos;s gotta look at that .   you can &apos;t sit up straight . 
tight security .   no guns .   real plus . 
i knew about jim .

well look ,  i &apos;m afraid i really ought to be  .  .  . 
quick ! 
well ,  she &apos;s got a point . 
oh ,  let me go and have a bit of peril ? 
no ,  no ,  this cannot be .    i am sworn to chastity ! 
when you have found the shrubbery ,  place the shrubbery here ,  beside this shrubbery  .  .  .  only slightly higher ,  so you get a two - level effect with a path through the middle . 
she loved him . 
i &apos;m not sure i do ,  archie . 
what are you doing ?  ! 
hey ,  barney . 
yeah ,  there &apos;s a good girl .   have you had a look at this hoof ?   she was limping badly .   i think there might be a stone in it . 
yes ,  but isn &apos;t midnight a little excessive ? 
you &apos;ll be sent a message . 
go inside at once . 
don &apos;t think i can &apos;t persuade her . 
do you hunt ? 
forgive me ,  i &apos;ve called you out and you should have been resting . 
no loyalty . 
i promised to protect her from people like you . 
she &apos;ll never understand it . 
yes .   that will be company for you . 
mr brown . 
it is a fine spot for a bench ,  is it not ? 
they &apos;re ready now . 
i was told you were in a fight . 
ma &apos;am ? 
 -  -  you stand there and tell me it is my duty  .  .  .  after all you promised me ! 
your majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance .   as for your people ,  look no further than the sales of your highland journals to see in what affection the nation holds their queen .   you sell even more copies than mr dickens . 
i never thought to be bullied by you ,  mr disraeli .   you ,  i thought ,  understood a widow &apos;s grief . 
should we take it seriously ? 
well ,  both . 
gossip counts .   lord aberdeen was right .   this country is not governed by wisdom but by talk .   granted ,  it wouldn &apos;t take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning ,  but if public opinion is against her ,  then it doesn &apos;t do to appear too close . 
what &apos;s her excuse this time ? 
erysipelas . 
the queen wishes to publish an account of him . 
we &apos;re expecting brown this afternoon ,  ma &apos;am . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  ma &apos;am ? 
no .   you are mistaken .   prince albert ,  my husband ,  had typhoid fever .   i asked what was wrong with my son . 
lord clarendon arrives ,  by invitation ,  at eleven o &apos;clock ,  followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate princess alice &apos;s birthday .  dispatches ,  as usual ,  at two .   the chancellor writes to say that ,  by happy coincidence ,  he will be in cowes for the weekend .   he asks if your majesty might grant him an audience . 
i have a letter ,  ma &apos;am . 
that &apos;s a very pretty shawl you are wearing ,  alex .   silk suits you well .   but you are not eating enough .   one must not let vanity overrule one &apos;s appetite . 
why is he not here ? 
what is the matter with him ? 
you &apos;ve got your ten levels ,  right ?  here they are .  .  .   each level has an exit ,  only remember ,  the exits aren &apos;t always what they seem .   first one &apos;s the blood red sky ,  then you &apos;ve got the blue desert ,  tower of ghosts ,  kingdom of the blind .  .  .   on each world you have to find a golden key and you &apos;ve only got so much time to do it in .   if you &apos;re too late ,  the screamer comes . 
level ten .   that &apos;s where you &apos;ve got to unlock arcade &apos;s heart using the keys you &apos;ve found . 
nick .  .  . 
can you turn off the game ? 
happy ? 
no ,  wait .   just listen .   i hooked it up earlier tonight ,  and it said my name .   as soon as i turned it on ,  nick .   it said my name .   how could it know ?   and then ,  i asked it where greg was ,  and it said ,   &quot; in here &quot;  . 
we have to find out what &apos;s happened to them .  i think they &apos;re gone .  .  . 
maybe it is alive in a way .  .  . some sort of electronic intelligence .   it &apos;s like a computer virus that developed a personality or something .   it &apos;s self - replicating .  .  . it mimics life . 
slip - stream . 
you realize that in order to do that ,  we &apos;d actually have to play the game . 
virgin sacrifices ? 
what alex is trying to say is that it  &quot; seems &quot;  like it &apos;s alive . 
i don &apos;t understand .   it wants us to play the game .   it &apos;s been taunting us  .  .  . 
it can turn itself on ,  alex !   it doesn &apos;t need a quarter . 
i know how to do this !   i &apos;m good at these games .   you never play ,  you &apos;d be nailed in an instant . 
i don &apos;t want anything to happen to you .   i care about you . 
which way do you think level two is ? 
and we &apos;ve still got time left .   this was a piece of cake . 
what the fuck is that ?  ! 
we can take the dunes down like a ski slope .  pretend you &apos;re on a snowboard . 
listen to me ,  alex .   these counselor &apos;s don &apos;t know anything .   they &apos;re full of shit .  if you don &apos;t fit the pattern of the perfect kid ,  they freak . 
so tell me you &apos;re okay ,  then . 
so how do i start ? 
home !  meet me at the office .  we &apos;ve got to do something  .  .  .  you &apos;ve got to do something adam ! 
adam ,  this isn &apos;t like you .  please come to the office .  there must be something we can do . 
what do you mean  &quot; you know &quot;  ? 
but i &apos;m not broke . 
cynthia .  .  .  that would not be a good idea . 
we &apos;d be happy to put her in the pile for considerations  .  .  .  you &apos;d be pleased to know there &apos;s quite a lot of interest in this role . 
sure want to thank ya for drivin &apos; all the way up to see me from that beverly hills hotel . 
so since you agree i guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life . 
damn lot of corn raised in hollywood these days too . 
i guess i &apos;ve come to quite a place . 
a car  .  .  .  a car accident . 
betty elms ? 
hi . 
i don &apos;t know . 
no .  .  .  .  i don &apos;t .  .  . 
there &apos;s nothing ? 
what &apos;s wrong with that ? 
 &quot; before i kill you .  &quot; 
wally brown . 
it &apos;s kind of embarrassing but , 
hardly . 
what about matt  ? 
so what do we do  ? 
then you didn &apos;t give him any passwords of any kind  ? 
do you have something better to talk about  ? 
he hired you to build this place  ? 
i was lured by all the money and i truly did convince myself that what i did was for justice .  since then ,  mccay has wanted to put anyone he can down here . 
there &apos;s more to it than trying to see if you &apos;d steal from the company or if you &apos;d lie or cheat . 
it wasn &apos;t my fault .  i was just part of a team .  i was doing my job .  .  . 
where are we going  ? 
apparently pretty high ,  we just got a new ceo last week . 
that &apos;s very funny ,  sir .  you are under arrest . 
no .  don &apos;t .  you &apos;ll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat . 
give me one good reason why i don &apos;t plug you right here ,  right now  ?  
that &apos;s nice .   i think i lost my wallet . 
is it over  ? 
don &apos;t . 
when i think you &apos;re ready . 
not down here .  i &apos;ll start trusting you when i feel there the time is right .  it &apos;s not personal ,  it &apos;s just survival . 
i see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last four months .  each one in the amount of $100 , 000 .  he then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account . 
he already had a balance of $600 , 000 . 
why don &apos;t you just stop fucking around and just die  ! 
perhaps it was .  i was in boarding school for so many years ,  it &apos;s hard to remember .  do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby  ? 
i have to say ,  that i am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass . 
i don &apos;t believe ol &apos; bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did .  he still insists on the  &quot; guests &quot;  being of the more nefarious type . 
i propose we consider a hostile take over .  perhaps ol &apos; bruce is in need of a new job opportunity . 
hey ,  mr .  executive .  buy you a drink sailor  ? 
only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob .  that if you wanted a good clean kill ,  that johnny tortelli was the man for the job . 
what is bruce doing  ? 
i don &apos;t know .  maybe we should watch the tape to be sure . 
the power went out in half the park . 
listen ,  i was thinking ,  you know .  would you go ,  it &apos;s i think you &apos;re .  .  . 
dinner at my place then  ?  say ,  seven o &apos;clock  ? 
would that impress you  ?  i mean you &apos;re the kinda woman that probably has ferrari written all over your personal ad . 
okay ,  now go under go under it  !  shoot vader &apos;s tie fighter  !  get him get him  ! 
not now ,  mom .

you &apos;re passing up archie bunker to go bowling ,  you &apos;ve gotta have an angle . 
ahh ,  strike ,  not ,  not bad at all .  no ,  this talk isn &apos;t about sex ,  it &apos;s ,  well there &apos;ve been a lot of changes ,  and i know you &apos;re upset about losing your room ,  but the baby &apos;s gotta go somewhere . 
maybe i should just move to china .  one kid per family ,  that way you don &apos;t lose your room . 
dad ,  when a boy likes you ,  does he pretend that he doesn &apos;t like you ?  and if he pretends that he doesn &apos;t like you how can you tell that he likes you ? 
she was talented ,  but honey i wish i could help you a little more ,  it &apos;s just that your mother and i had kind of a whirlwind courtship ,  she came to town with this traveling theater group ,  i proposed on our second date ,  two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone . 
i already bought a ticket .

you ratted on my mother ?  ? 
boyfriend ? 
uh oh .  .  . 
 .  .  . i dropped it . 
oh no ,  we wouldn &apos;t be from the same bloodlines or anything .  we &apos;d be like two total strangers who .  .  . accidentally had relatives that got married . 
yeah ?

i think she looks nice !  her lips are very thin so i used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality ,  and her eyes just needed a little definition ,  and her hair ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972 . 
well the other night at dinner .  .  . 
can not do without ,  harry &apos;s wild about me . 
in lieu .  .  .  &quot;instead&quot; .  .  .  .  no contest .

goodnight shelly . 
can we see it from the back yard ? 
did you ahh ,  love him ? 
stop hiding harry ,  you run harry .  when i first came here ,  the idea of working with dead people ,  didn &apos;t exactly thrill me ,  but when i saw a family lived here ,  i thought ,  &quot;if i &apos;m living without a family ,  at least i can work with one ,  and maybe once in a while i &apos;ll be invited in for supper . &quot;
i was born jaundiced .  once i sat on a toilet seat at a truck stop and caught hemorrhoids .  and i &apos;ve learned to live with this chicken bone that &apos;s been lodged in my throat for the past three years ,  so i knew dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction .   dad ,  i don &apos;t wanna upset you ,  but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right .  it can only mean one thing .   cancer .   i &apos;m dying . 
of course not . 
daddy ,  can i have thirty five dollars ? 
dad ?  ? 
the money ? 
ahh ,  i just wanna look nice . 
well shelly &apos;s coming over ,  we &apos;re gonna go together . 
hey ,  ouch ,  damn it !  !  vada ,  watch what you &apos;re doing . 
i fall asleep at the wheel . 
vada ,  something happened to thomas j last night ,  he stepped on a beehive . 
maybe i should go over and yell at him . 
why not ? 
he &apos;s okay isn &apos;t he ? 
the bees killed thomas j ,  and i killed my mother . 
i found this .

well well well ,  what &apos;s going on in here ? 
that &apos;s true .  harry harry sit down ,  let me fill you in on today &apos;s women ,  since the last time you dated ,  something happened ,  &quot;the sexual revolution&quot; ,  now before that ,  you used to have to hold a door open for a woman ,  pull her chair out ,  pick up the check ,  no more no more ,  you wanna know what else is missing ?  bras ! 
no .  well ,  guess i &apos;ll go home and finish off war &amp; peace . 
so you fill it with water like this ,  and what have you got ?  a water gun . 
cause she &apos;s dying . 
cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house ,  and you know that saying ,  if you can &apos;t beat  &apos;em ,  join  &apos;em ,  well if she &apos;s one of them ,  she won &apos;t be as scared . 
he must like shelly ,  i never saw him hit anyone in his life . 
really ? 
who &apos;s winning ? 
maybe black means you &apos;re happy ? 
vada ?  vada ?  ?  what happened ?  ?

well ,  it &apos;s better than windin &apos; up like a bum . 
i &apos;m duff . 
i asked you somethin &apos; ,  boy ! 
seems a little loose ! 
how often is that ? 
i think if you tried livin &apos; in a town like this ,  instead of running free and easy ,  you &apos;d soon change your tune . 
and since we &apos;re talking ,  my wife and i don &apos;t want you hanging around our daughter . 
so i been told . 
why don &apos;t you guys buy your own ? 
sure .  got a sixteen - year - old girl . 
come on ,  will . 
omar -  - 
they &apos;re a bit too real for my taste .  will you excuse me for a moment ? 
she &apos;s very striking ,  don &apos;t you think ?  are these glasses a fashion where she comes from ? 
what about her ? 
ghost a steppin &apos; razor .  .  . 
the villa straylight .  home of the royal family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as wintermute .  if we can get molly in ,  she can access the mainframe to cripple mute &apos;s defences ,  the case can destroy it in cyberspace . 
then you &apos;ll have to persuade her to tell it to you . 
are you sure you &apos;re up to this ,  mr .  case ?  we could reconvene tomorrow . 
what would you say if i told you we could correct your neural damage ? 
there are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries .  they &apos;re dissolving ,  case .  .  .  slowly ,  but they &apos;re definitely dissolving .  you have just long enough to do the job . 
you ran without us . 
did you trace it ? 
let &apos;s hope she doesn &apos;t expect me to swim upstream . 
that &apos;s lord frederick tessier .  owns most of freeside .  wintermute &apos;s mainframe is centred in the royal family &apos;s villa . 
that &apos;s nice ,  but we can &apos;t dodge this kind of heat for long . 
you &apos;ve got your orders . 
then i &apos;m out .  i don &apos;t give a shit about you or this run . 
ah ,  herr case .  and how is the artiste tonight ? 
i saw your girl yesterday . 
ya learned good .  so ,  what &apos;s happening ? 
what elders ? 
ready ? 
who got you into this ? 
yo .

oh jesus . 
would you like something to nibble  -  -  apricots ,  soaked in honey  -  -  quite why ,  no one knows  -  -  because it stops them tasting of apricots ,  and makes them taste like honey ,  and if you wanted honey ,  you &apos;d just buy honey ,  instead of apricots ,  but nevertheless  -  -  there we go  -  -  yours if you want them .

the chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the jap patrols do ,  if any of the planes make it . 
well which of those three ya want fixed ? 
what &apos;s it going to be ,  elizabeth ?  seventyfive ?  eighty ? 
lucky lady .  hi . 
charlie really has a great voice . 
peggy sue ! 
not that i &apos;m glad you were sick ,  but i had a chance to do some thinking last night . 
it &apos;s not going to be forever .  i figure three years is long enough .  i can see it the music pans out .   and right after graduation we should start seeing other people .  kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married .  know what i mean ? 
where did you get that sweater ? 
right .  i promised my mother . 
what do you know about classical music ? 
does this mean you like me again ? 
forget it ,  it &apos;ll never work . 
will you take me back to my grandparents ? 
but i love you .  i &apos;ll love you forever . 
you were terrific .   and i kept trying to push you away but you wouldn &apos;t give up . 
if you believe it ,  darling ,  then i believe .  being young can be just as confusing as being old .  the things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday . 
how come we &apos;re your best friends and we had to find out about you and michael fitzsimmons from dolores ? 
cool it kids .  he &apos;s free to see other girls ,  if he wants . 
the young man leaned back in his chair .  no bulls would die today . 
coffee and a donut . 
the world is fantastic .  it &apos;s the ultimate absurd circus .  i am shot from a cannon into the energy . 
a ray of oneness piercing the solitude .  falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh .  you &apos;ll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire . 
now listen ,  this is the plan .  as soon as school is finished we go to utah and .  .  . 
rita .  i met her last summer .  she &apos;s cool .  you &apos;ll really dig her .  she &apos;s got this great little cabin in the hills ,  just outside of provo where she raises chickens .  i &apos;ll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us . 
but what about the other night ?  we were like two stars in the same constellation . 
you think so ? 
peggy ,  let me ask you something .   you &apos;re not .  .  .  expecting are you ? 
for me ? 
i wanted to apologize for this morning . 
the hat business is in trouble . 
yes . 
but when john f .  kennedy &apos;s elected president ,  men &apos;1l stop wearing hats . 
i don &apos;t need your charity .  i don &apos;t need your grandmother &apos;s jewelry or your parents money  - how could you do that ? 
my little baby .  don &apos;t try to grow up so fast . 
well ,  she is getting on ,  but she &apos;s fine .  i told her you weren &apos;t feeling well yesterday .  she called to find out how you are . 
maddy &apos;s party . 
you think this &apos;ll cheer dad up ? 
he &apos;s not here .  we &apos;re getting divorced . 
it &apos;s not that .  can we meet after school ?  please ? 
because i &apos;m telling you the truth .  i know what &apos;s going to happen .  there &apos;s going to be test tube babies and heart transplants .  and an american named neil armstrong is going to walk on the moon .  on july 20 ,  1969 . 
you look pretty good for a corpse . 
what &apos;re you doing ? 
no offense ,  but for a person who says she &apos;s lived an extra lifetime ,  you certainly are thick .  money is power .  .  money makes people respect you .  .  . 
look it &apos;s very simple .  you tell me everything that hasn &apos;t been invented yet ,  and i &apos;ll invent it .  we &apos;ll be partners .  fiftyfifty . 
ah .  this is a biggie .  forget sneakers .  running shoes ,  jogging shoes ,  tennis shoes .  fifty to two hundred dollars a pair . 
there are major fortunes to be made here .  leisure time and lifestyles . 
it was an unfair fight .  he didn &apos;t have a chance .  i &apos;m taking a real gamble .  i loved him for a long ,  long time . 
like what ? 
you are completely relaxed .  when i count to three ,  you will open your eyes .  one .  .  .  two .  .  .  three .   we &apos;ll start with something easy .  what is your name ? 
what will they be made of ? 
that &apos;s just perfect isn &apos;t it ?  did it work ?  did you find out why i came back ? 
what &apos;s the matter ? 
what do they do up there ? 
just out . 
not that much appreciation .  i thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass . 
i swear ,  sometimes i wish gus was dead .  .  . 
it &apos;s getting pretty late .  we better go . 
you think my dad &apos;ll figure out why he &apos;s not getting better ? 
how can he not have a heartbeat ? 
what was that all about ?  you think he &apos;s trying to scare us ? 
do you think everyone that came back would be like gus ? 
mom .  .  . 
jesus . 
what &apos;s wrong with your face ? 
this time .  what about next time ? 
excuse me ,  charles .  with all due respect .  .  .  this is .  .  .  preposterous !  it doesn &apos;t make any sense ,  it sounds as if we &apos;re talking about someone else .  pardon the lack of humility ,  but i &apos;ve had the distinct impression i was kind of .  .  .  one of the rising stars around here .  and i feel that wasn &apos;t just my imagination .  and i also think i deserve to know what &apos;s really going on here ,  charles . 
it could be parasites ,  an infection .  .  . 
thanks for leaving school ,  and coming here ,  and .  .  .   i will be back .  an hour ,  tops . 
fuck you . 
you &apos;re scared .  you think we &apos;re near the end . 
you want me to give up ?  let this thing turn us into victims< / u> ? 
i &apos;m not ready to die . 
thanks ,  charles . 
mr .  beckett ,  i &apos;m sorry .  .  . 
innocuous ? 
kids are great . 
i misplaced an important complaint .  that &apos;s their story .  want to hear mine ? 
thanks for your time . 
oh ,  beckett .  how &apos;s it goin &apos; ? 
huh ?  oh .  great .  she &apos;s great . 
how did they find out ? 
excuse me ,  i &apos;m having a goddamn party ,  is that allright with you ? 
when you refer to wheeler ,  call him charles ,  to show how you &apos;d been admitted to the inner circle ,  you were considered one of them . 
opera ? 
particularly ,  charles . 
are you a good lawyer ? 
excellent work ,  joe .  i thank you . 
i thought i was supposed to be covering for you .   god ,  andy ,  you look awful . 
do men have sex with each other in that theater ? 
yes . 
andy !  this is a nice surprise .  how are you ,  hon ? 
hi ,  mom .  how do you feel on your fortieth anniversary ? 
were you recently promoted ? 
objection ! 
the hiv virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids ,  namely blood and semen . 
were you pleased with his work ? 
did that thrill ,  impress and overwhelm you ? 
you load the film .  .  .   ?  no ,  on this side .  .  .  or this side ?  don &apos;t move the baby ! 
i mean ,  two guys ,  doing the horizontal thing ?  i don &apos;t get it .  don &apos;t they get confused ?   &quot; is that mine ?  i thought it was yours .  &quot;  hey ,  call me old fashioned ,  call me conservative .  .  .  i think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is . 
have you changed your aftershave ? 
okay ,  so .  .  .  help me with this one ,  joe .  .  .  is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone &apos;s mouth ?  or ,  is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into their< / u> mouth ? 
right . 
attorney for the plaintiff ? 
based on what my client would have earned over the next three years ,  including benefits and projected raises ,  and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with acquired immune deficiency syndrome .  .  .  we would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars . 
 .  .  .  to suit their personal desires ,  and the rest of us have to live with it . 
don &apos;t wanna miss this . 
probably okay to talk to me now . 
tell me that was you . 
oh ,  lord .  .  .  . 
you did this ?  to yourself ? 
heard about it .  just never seen it . 
just come with me ! 
what ,  switch what ? 
a very good sign .   that &apos;s riddick &apos;s direction .  you do not< / u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy . 
probably makes it worse .  dehydrates you even more . 
you see anybody else here ?  just between you and me . 
little ratty - ass . 
okay ,  that should buy us a sys - check .  but we &apos;ll need more cells . 
rag it ,  riddick .  nobody wants your theories on  -  - 
you know ,  he hasn &apos;t harmed any of us .  far as i can tell ,  he hasn &apos;t even lied to us .  just stick to the deal ,  johns .  let him go if that &apos;s what it  -  - 
dancin &apos; on razor blades here .  .  . 
stop it ,  stop it ,  stop it ! 
just shut up ,  okay ? 
fry ? 
so quiet .  you get used to the sounds of the ship ,  then .  .  .  . 
one is all ? 
they &apos;re afraid of our light .  that means we don &apos;t have to be so afraid of them . 
the sled as a shield .  .  .  . 
she &apos;s the captain ,  we should listen to  -  - 
what the hell are these ? 
so just like that .  wave your little wand and he &apos;s one of us now . 
well ,  just a skiff .  disposable ,  really . 
i &apos;d rather piss glass . 
think about that reward ,  johns . 
ain &apos;t all of us gonna make it . 
either way ,  figure it &apos;s something you can grab onto . 
don &apos;t wanna feed these land - sharks  -  -  just keep  &apos;em off our scent . 
so much for your nightfall . 
take it . 
dr .  zaius  -  - 
the best .  but we won &apos;t need them . 
look  -  -  she remembers . 
 &apos;then how do you account for me ?  , 
a toy .  it floats on the air .   try it . 
we &apos;d better get started .  if the mounted police pick up our trail ,  they &apos;ll come this far at least . 
one pistol .  .  .  twenty - four rounds of ammo .  two medical kits .  .  one camera .  .  .  one tx9 .   we &apos;ve enough food and water for three days . 
objection .  the accused is indeed a man .  therefore ,  he has no rights under ape law . 
that &apos;s true ,  dr .  zaius .  my witnesses  -  -  correction  -  -  my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater . 
objection !  these remarks are profane and irrelevant . 
objection ! 
of course he doesn &apos;t know our culture  -  because he cannot think .   tell us why all apes are created equal . 
you could get hurt doing that ,  doctor . 
awww ,  it still hurts ,  doesn &apos;t it ? 
he &apos;s trying to form words . 
all right  -  - 
i want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner . 
lucius . 
i told you not to bring the other one . 
and our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast ,  and determine what &apos;s to be done with him . 
you destroyed his memory !  his mind !  his identity !  and ,  you want to do the same to me ! 
let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential ,  and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the tribunal .   you may proceed ,  dr .  honorius . 
what about me ? 
because you &apos;re not unique .  there was the one you call landon  -  - 
you may well call it upside down ,  since you occupy its lowest level .  and deservedly .   the eastern desert has never been explored  -  -  because we &apos;ve always assumed that no life can exist there .   save yourself ,  taylor .  tell me  -  -  is there another jungle beyond the forbidden zone ? 
we &apos;re back at the beginning .  i still don &apos;t know the why .  a planet where apes evolved from men .  a world turned wrong side up .  a puzzle with one piece missing . 
it &apos;s him .  .  . landon . 
would you like to come along ? 
dr .  zira  -  -  you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert . 
secondly ,  if these  &apos;tools &apos; as you call them ,  are unidentified ,  why are they introduced as  &apos;evidence &apos; of anything ? 
but the proof ?  the doll ? 
 .  .  . but  &apos;lias is still out there . 
elias is dead .  join up with the platoon .  move it . 
where the fuck is red platoon !  tell  &apos;em to get their asses up here !  what the fuck you doin &apos; back here elias ?  round up your assholes and move  &apos;em up front ,  we &apos;re getting chopped to shit . 
hey big harold ,  gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man . 
c &apos;mon man ,  didn &apos;t i do you right that time i give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit . 
taylor  -  get your ass over here .  move ! 
first time ? 
feel good ? 
 .  .  . i can &apos;t sleep ,  why don &apos;t you get some sack time . 
 .  .  . beautiful night .

 .  .  . you know that night we got hit .  .  .  i .  .  .  
you been smoking too much shit babe .  gotta control that .  takes a man down .  .  .  i remember when you first come out to the bush ,  you was straight as a .  .  . 
excuses are like assholes ,  taylor  -  everybody got one . 
not the only man to meet his jezebel either . 
then you jes gonna forget  &apos;bout elias and all the good times we done had ?  right in here . 
i didn &apos;t like it . 
same as an hour ago .  remember ?  i &apos;m the steady type . 
or reno ?   they always throw them off the bridge there ,  i &apos;ve heard . 
suppose i hadn &apos;t known that immigration inspector ?  hadn &apos;t put in a good word for you ? 
what &apos;s the matter ? 
good evening ,  miss . 
a fellow named brandon has a penthouse here .  he &apos;s holding open house .  i was up there .  too noisy .  bored . 
it &apos;s open - house .  no crashing involved .  anybody in the hotel &apos;s welcome . 
what time is it ? 
there &apos;s a lot of night left to live through . 
want to dance ? 
why not ? 
cant be too close for me .   right across the street from it suits me .   anything else listed ? 
how bad is it ?   bad enough for -  -  
cold ? 
if you &apos;re doing all this just for me . 
including killaine .  .  . i still can &apos;t think of you that way . 
magruder obliged me .   no use my saying it wasn &apos;t planned that way .  i had to clean up .   i &apos;m not a dumb -  smart college boy anymore .   nobody in the world would believe i didn &apos;t plan the whole thing . 
i think you mean that . 
mrs .  west is a very emotional woman . 
i &apos;ll have to know a little more than that . 
true .  i was a bit irritable last night .  i apologize . 
then there isn &apos;t much i can do ,  is there ? 
that &apos;s something i can &apos;t spare you .   but i won &apos;t do it myself . 
you &apos;ve got a couple of hours ,  maybe . 
what are you going to do -  - toss your job into puget sound ?   because i make you think of magnolias ?   i thought policeman was something like a soldier .   that his duty came first .   however much he might happen hate it . 
what proper grounds ?   you can &apos;t be in love with me .   you hardly know me .   i &apos;m not in love with you . 
he could have killed me a dozen times .   you &apos;d never have known . 
no ,  jeff .   you don &apos;t .   he &apos;s not a murderer ,  i tell you .   he;s not a murderer . 
good morning ,  mr .  brandon . 
mr .  reed ,  please ,  for mr .   brandon .   very well .  have him call .  mr .  brandon is in his office now .   mr .  reed stepped out ,  mr .   brandon . 
nice friendly approach you &apos;ve got .  goble .  i could hardly walk when i got out of bed this morning . 
sorry .  another client paid for that .  you can hire me not to use it . 
i don &apos;t like your perfume in my office .  make it somewhere else if you don &apos;t like charlie &apos;s . 
what &apos;ll you have ,  margo ? 
all right ,  let &apos;s see the buzzer . 
so you &apos;re not a cop . 
that &apos;s what i like about cocktail parties .  everyone is so perfectly natural . 
could be . 
how about a cup of coffee ? 
time for a little chat ? 
thanks .   lovely view you have ,  haven &apos;t you ? 
i &apos;ve always thought you were a pretty nice guy ,  brandon .   i &apos;d like to go on thinking so .   if you tried to help her get away -  - 
information . 
not if she knew she wouldn &apos;t be believed . 
i had a father who knew how to steal . 
i wouldn &apos;t know .  just do it somewhere else .  there is such a thing as good manners . 
i saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun .  you lied .  it was obvious . 
mr .  clarendon ,  have you ever seen this before ? 
you have two murders to investigate .  this man &apos;s head was beaten in .  and there &apos;s nothing in his pockets . 
i got through to greer ,  his partner in the detective business .   greer won &apos;t give out . 
i &apos;m looking for mr .  brandon . 
i need a receipt .   sign your name across the flap . 
right .  a clean deduction from observed facts .  they &apos;ve got to be simple once in a while ,  inspector . 
not too hard ,  is it ? 
you can find out the first part .  the second part you have to take a chance on . 
scotch and plain water ,  i think . 
what about me ? 
you knew mitchell pretty well ,  didn &apos;t you ,  mrs .  west ? 
then why not give miss mayfield the benefit of the doubt ? 
no doubt about that one . 
so far . 
this gun permit was issued to clark brandon ? 
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re not very glad to see me ,  margo . 
you shouldn &apos;t .  you washed me up very thoroughly . 
it &apos;s the only pose i have left .  i &apos;m sunk .  broke .  i don &apos;t even have my hotel bill . 
what &apos;s this ? 
you &apos;re very attractive ,  my dear .  and you look very unsophisticated . 
mr .  penfield .   i am sorry to have kept you . 
you &apos;re kind to be so encouraging . 
it &apos;s a pity she couldn &apos;t make it up here today . 
but i &apos;m not an interviewer or a correspondent . 
terrific . 
charles !   i didn &apos;t know you were back .   have a good holiday ? 
aha .   james giving some woman the old heave - ho . 
it &apos;s terribly good . 
really ?   i thought those long flashbacks were extremely good . 
good theory .   but i like my mother .  i have no aversions to what she does . 
i called you a taxi . 
again ? 
me too . 
in radio we &apos;re different . 
i think we &apos;re ready now ,  thank you .   and how was norfolk ?   did you get on with my mother ? 
look ,  will you come on a walk with me tomorrow ? 
shall we have a drink or something ? 
we don &apos;t seem to get much time to talk . 
it &apos;s obvious what you have to do .  your way into the daughter &apos;s pants is through the mother ,  up the suez canal .  .  . 
she &apos;s very nice ,  apparently .   lives in norfolk .   and very left - wing .  you &apos;ll have to watch yourself there . 
what have you been up to ? 
hello ,  jimmy . 
i &apos;m sorry about saturday ,  dad .   it was just impossible to get away . 
everyone &apos;s been marvellous really ,  jimmy .   the neighbours come and sit with her while i &apos;m at work . 
you &apos;re so famous now . 
we &apos;re thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools .   world history since 1945 .   twelve programmes ,  lots of stock film . 
we &apos;ll see what we can do . 
you always talk like this ?   you &apos;re not gonna start chanting or anything are you ? 
i &apos;ve watched you once or twice .   you surf like it &apos;s some kind of street fight .   you jerk along from moment to moment ,  fighting everything that comes at you .   always trying to win . 
what &apos;s this ? 
you &apos;re a fucking dead man -  - 
bodhi ,  this is your wake up call ,  man  -  -  i .  .  .  am .  .  .  an .  .  .  eff .  .  .  bee .  .  .  eye .  .  .  agent !  ! 
you gotta tell me where she is . 
look ,  bodhi man .   people are dead .  the ride is over . 
special agent utah ,  this is not some job flippin &apos; burgers at the drive - in .  yes ,  the surfboard bothers me .   yes ,  your approach to this case bothers me .   and yes ,  you bother me .   you two have produced squat in the last two weeks ,  during which time the ex -  presidents have robbed two more banks !  !   do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me ? 
yeah ,  i get it .   time to play let &apos;s dick the old guys ,  huh ,  harp ? 
yeah .   what &apos;s your theory ? 
johnny ,  it &apos;s the only way . 
i say we call it in .   get some backup .   but you gotta do it .   harp won &apos;t listen to me . 
who &apos;s the girl ? 
sure ,  he &apos;s  &quot; the bodhisattva &quot;  . 
well ,  usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration ,  like you &apos;re doing this for a school project or something .  .  .  i don &apos;t know ,  like something &apos;s driving you .   see ,  it &apos;s gone .   if i didn &apos;t know better i &apos;d say you looked almost happy . 
i don &apos;t believe he did ,  sir .  i couldn &apos;t find a single track .  just doesn &apos;t make sense . 
you don &apos;t know how much i missed this ,  dutch !  !  !  once you get this in your blood ,  you never get it out !  !  ! 
billy &apos;s on it .   heat seeker .  pretty sophisticated for half - asses mountain boys . 
mean anything to you ? 
i knew this man .  green berets ,  out of fort bragg .  what the hell were they doing in here ?  you got any answers for this ,  dillon ? 
why us ? 
blain .  .  .    .  .  .  just like the others .  .  .  no powder burns ,  no shrapnel . 
what the hell do you think you &apos;re doing ? 
no way ,  dutch .  i &apos;m going .  you get these people and get the hell out of here . 
guess i &apos;ve picked up some bad habits from you ,  dutch .  now don &apos;t argue with me ,  you know i &apos;m right .  get to that chopper and hold it for us .  we &apos;ll be along . 
thanks . 
what &apos;s got billy so spooked ? 
you saw what ? 
you &apos;re looking well ,  dutch . 
major ,  you &apos;d better take a look at this . 
i like your hat . 
let &apos;s not talk about it ,  it &apos;s too depressing .   come on ,  i &apos;ll show you thunder . 
congratulations ,  sir . 
who are you going after next ,  sir ? 
what would it take to buy our stock back ?   name your price . 
mr .  kross ,  i &apos;m not here to sell you my stock .   on the contrary ,  i &apos;m here to buy yours . 
of course ,  yes .   after the expected< / u> filing period is over ,  i &apos;m going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid . 
stop .   for just a moment .   mr .  kross ,  i &apos;d like to ask you a few questions before< / u> you sign .  you realize that you &apos;re a target .  if you weren &apos;t mine ,  you &apos;d be someone elses ,  correct ? 
what ?   you gonna tell me you &apos;re lost ? 
ho< / u>tel . 
what &apos;s your name ? 
must be dangerous .   hooking . 
ugly habit ,  biting your nails . 
for the whole night ? 
want to know something ?   i don &apos;t quite know .   i hadn &apos;t planned this . 
let &apos;s talk some more first . 
i think he wanted you to tip him . 
i buy companies . 
by breaking up a company &apos;s assets  -  - 
it &apos;d cost you . 
three . 
i think you &apos;ll approve . 
know what we &apos;re gonna do in a little while then ?   we &apos;re gonna call domino &apos;s and have &apos;m deliver a bigass pizza .   we &apos;re gonna eat it in bed .   we &apos;re gonna veg &apos; out and watch television . 
yeah ,  it &apos;s this box ,  it has pictures ,  sound .   you don &apos;t have to use your brain at all . 
seems like it .   i guess it &apos;s easy to get used to ,  huh ? 
you still mad at &apos;m ? 
what &apos;s that ? 
you don &apos;t want to go all the way to san francisco in a limousine ,  do you ?   i don &apos;t . 
one more night and you &apos;re finally rid of me . 
last time i saw him he was this strong guy .   now he &apos;s beaten .  and you liked him< / u> . 
business . 
barnard thomas ,  manager of the hotel . 
listen ,  there &apos;re some major local talent inside just dying to meet you .  .  . 
i &apos;ll see him alone .   everyone knows you &apos;re my muscle .   we &apos;ll make it social .   tell kross i &apos;ll meet him for dinner .   tonight if you can arrange it . 
i don &apos;t think there &apos;s any sense in  -  - 
carlos had some great rock . 
no ,  let &apos;s go to work .   okay ? 
who did you think ? 
yeah ,  what ? 
niece ? 
i think you &apos;ll find it normal enough . 
then you use your soup spoon< / u> . 
barnard thomas here .   miss vivian ,  i wonder if you might come down to the front desk .   there &apos;s someone here to see you . 
come on ,  barney ,  you and me live in the real world .   you don &apos;t know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady ,  mr .  thomas . 
what is with you ? 
no ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  i don &apos;t . 
having a good time ,  vivian ? 
yeah .   sure .   why not .   call me at the regent beverly wilshire . 
i bet .   a lousy whore and you &apos;re the gum in a hundred million dollar deal . 
don &apos;t even think  -  -    -  -  don &apos;t even think about trying to escape .  the chains are far too thick .  and don &apos;t dream of being rescued either .  the only way in is secret .  and only the prince ,  the count ,  and i know how to get in and out . 
you never sent the ships .  don &apos;t bother lying .  it doesn &apos;t matter .  westley will come for me anyway . 
catch your breath . 
we &apos;ll never succeed  -  -  we may as well die here . 
frankly ,  i think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting . 
no more rhymes now ,  i mean it . 
finish him ,  finish him .  your way . 
no  -  -  not vizzini  -  -  i need the man in black  -  - 
to find the man in black ,  obviously . 
her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there .  his name was westley ,  but she never called him that .   isn &apos;t that a wonderful beginning ? 
it was ten days till the wedding .  the king still lived ,  but buttercup &apos;s nightmares were growing steadily worse . 
you mean you wish to surrender to me ?  very well ,  i accept . 
ah ,  but how will you capture us ?  we know the secrets of the fire swamp .  we can live there quite happily for some time .  so ,  whenever you feel like dying ,  feel free to visit . 
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m quite familiar with that phrase . 
your princess is really a winning creature .  a trifle simple ,  perhaps ,  but her appeal is undeniable . 
buttercup is marrying humperdinck in a little less than half an hour ,  so all we have to do is get in ,  break up the wedding ,  steal the princess ,  make our escape after i kill count rugen . 
where &apos;s fezzik ? 
you know ,  it &apos;s very strange  -  -  i have been in the revenge business so long ,  now that it &apos;s over ,  i don &apos;t know what to do with the rest of my life . 
we &apos;re really in a terrible rush . 
humiliations galore ! 
i could do that .  in fact ,  i &apos;ve got some rope up here .  but i do not think that you will accept my help ,  since i am only waiting around to kill you . 
i hate waiting .  i could give you my word as a spaniard . 
you don &apos;t know any way you &apos;ll trust me ? 
i admit it  -  -  you are better than i am . 
as i told you ,  it would be absolutely ,  totally ,  and in all other ways ,  inconceivable .  no one in guilder knows what we &apos;ve done .  and no one in florin could have gotten here so fast .  out of curiosity ,  why do you ask ? 
he &apos;s climbing the rope .  and he &apos;s gaining on us . 
he didn &apos;t fall ?  inconceivable !  ! 
i want to duel him left - handed . 
now ,  a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet ,  because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given .  i &apos;m not a great fool ,  so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you .  but you must have known i was not a great fool; you would have counted on it ,  so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me . 
then make your choice . 
you guessed wrong . 
guess what . 
how would you like to go back to teasing hair ,  big mouth ? 
 &quot; he &apos;s gonna croon love &apos;s tune , 
 &quot; honeymoon ,  honeymoon , 
you mean ooops ,  don &apos;t you ?   say ooops and get out . 
uh  .  .  .  uh  .  .  .  ooooooops ? 
you have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect .   one  .  .  .  two  .  .  . 
you have forty - eight seconds left .  hurry .   hurry . 
they come here .   they all come here .  how do they find me ? 
nothing .   nothing .   do it .   do it . 
see ?   you could have raised a million dollars ,  put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest . 
much ,  thank you .   but i am a little lightheaded .   maybe i should eat something .   hysterics have a way of severely depleting one &apos;s blood sugar ,  you know . 
maybe you &apos;re happy . 
you can &apos;t feel it when it &apos;s in your hand ,  when it &apos;s in your pocket . 
then the department of justice owns 100% of bialystock and bloom . 
roger de bris .   roger de bris .   oh yes ,  the director .   is he good .  .  .  i mean bad ? 
why don &apos;t we go over to the theatre and see what &apos;s really happening ?  after all ,  we &apos;ve only heard from a small portion of the audience .  let &apos;s hear what the majority thinks . 
vhy do you persecute me ?   my papers are in order .   i love my country .    &quot; oh ,  beautiful for spacious skies ,  for amber vaves of grain .  &quot; 
 &quot; i &apos;m a yankee doodle dandy  .  .  . 
my play ?   you mean ,   &quot; springtime for  .  .  .   &quot;  you know who ? 
wait .   no .   how do i know i can trust you ?   how do i know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived ? 
franz ,  trust me .   i promise i won &apos;t let you down . 
five o &apos;clock .   killed a whole day playing hide - and - seek with a crazy kraut . 
now ve take the two fuse leads ,  attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve &apos;re in business . 
plus to minus .   negative to positive .  male to .  .  . 
here .   you see .   this is the slow fuse .   it is much wider .   it has more resistance ,  more density .  therefore ,  it burns slower . 
vhy do you always call me kraut ?  kraut is cabbage !   do ve call you hot dogs ?   ve call you yanks not franks ! 
until thursday ,  then ,  you bawdy wench . 
good .   yes .   thursday . 
is it all right ?   i made it out to cash .   you didn &apos;t tell me the name of the play . 
by the sacred memory .  .  . 
of siegfried .  .  . 
wagner .  .  . 
hindenburg .  .  . 
lorenzo saint dubois .   but everybody calls me lsd . 
who can we attack ?   they &apos;re all too big . 
oh .  i thought .  .  .  you said you &apos;d been to so many in two days .  .  .   what was it you wanted to ask ? 
she arrived kind of late ,  wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early . 
i don &apos;t know what you expect me to know about .  .  .  people come and go .  .  . 
not at all ! 
i &apos;m not a fool !  and i &apos;m not capable of being fooled !  not even by women ! 
somebody better tell me what &apos;s going on and tell me fast !  i can take so much and then .  .  . 
there &apos;s an old saying ,   &quot; first customer of the day is always the most trouble !  &quot;  but like i said ,  i &apos;m in no mood for it so i &apos;m just going to treat you so fair and square you won &apos;t have one human reason to give me .  .  . 
go ahead !  spin it around the block .  now i know you don &apos;t know anything about engine condition ,  but you can feel ,  can &apos;t you .  .  .  and it &apos;s all in the feel ,  believe me ,  you feel that one around the block .  .  . 
aha !  always got time to argue money ,  huh .  .  .  ? 
it &apos;ll pass .  headaches are like resolutions .  .  .  you forget them soon as they stop hurting . 
will you help us ?  i think something &apos;s wrong out there ! 
forty thousand dollars . 
i &apos;m mary &apos;s sister . 
here ? 
what &apos;s the matter ? 
and you thought she &apos;d come up here ,  to me ?  if she had ,  what reason would she have for not calling you ? 
is mary .  .  .  in trouble ? 
no .  the man whose money she .  .  .  he talked so loud and fast ,  and i .  .  .  i should &apos;ve called the police . 
no .  i just think .  .  .  anything can be explained .  but mary ,  doing a thing like this .  .  .  i don &apos;t know how to handle .  .  . 
arbogast said .  .  . 
no ,  thank you .  it &apos;s my problem ,  too . 
yes . 
you going to wait here for me ? 
we could laze around here a while longer . 
you sure talk like a girl who &apos;s been married . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  mary .   my old dad used to say  &apos;when you can &apos;t change a situation ,  laugh at it .  &apos; nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it . 
and i &apos;m a working man !  we &apos;re a regular working - class tragedy !  
you can &apos;t laugh at it ,  huh ? 
not even just to see you ,  to have lunch .  .  .  in public ? 
i &apos;m fed up with sweating for people who aren &apos;t there .  i sweat to pay off my father &apos;s debts .  .  .  and he &apos;s in his grave .  .  .  i sweat to pay my ex - wife alimony ,  and she &apos;s living on the other side of the world somewhere . 
and live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in fairvale .  we &apos;ll have a lot of laughs .  when i send my ex - wife her money ,  you can lick the stamps . 
i want sleep more than anything .  except maybe ,  food . 
am i that close to fairvale ? 
you &apos;re not going to go out again and drive up to that diner ,  are you ? 
i &apos;ve caused you some trouble . 
it &apos;s a strange hobby .  curious ,  i mean . 
is your time so empty ? 
if anyone ever spoke to me ,  the way i heard .  .  .  the way she spoke to you ,  i don &apos;t think i could ever laugh again . 
an institution ?  a madhouse ?   people always call a madhouse  &quot; someplace .  &quot;   put her in someplace ! 
you &apos;re not going to .  .  .  to your room already ? 
alright ,  miss .  .  .  
that &apos;s it .  
in the course of my duty ,  i never  &quot; take up &quot;  anyone &apos;s time ,  whether it &apos;s to give a warning ,  or a ticket ,  or help !  believe that ,  m &apos;am .   now if you woke up on the wrong side of .  .  .  the car seat ,  that &apos;s one thing .  but when you act as if i &apos;ve just placed you under arrest .  .  . 
wait a minute ! 
bates &apos; motel .   he has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it .  .  .  go on ,  sam . 
barefaced . 
i &apos;ll get your bags . 
looking for me ? 
i won &apos;t have you bringing strange young girls in for supper .  .  .    .  .  . by candlelight ,  i suppose ,  in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap ,  erotic minds ! 
and then what ?  after supper ,  music ?  whispers ? 
so -  - friendly or otherwise -  -  ? 
who wants your money -  -  maybe i can help you . 
but where do the rats come in ? 
i &apos;m detective jones .  just dropped in to tell you a bit of news . 
by the way ,  where is< / u> your assistant ? 
yes indeed .  he has been a difficult< / u> case .  now that you< / u> have him in custody -  - you have him haven &apos;t you ? 
fine .  mrs .  buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea . 
you &apos;re losing your blood ? 
that spoke to you ? 
there &apos;s no child here . 
there &apos;s no child here ,  and no dogs either . 
what are you laughing at ? 
i don &apos;t see any big - moneyed boys running after you . 
did you ?  where ? 
all right ,  you raise the kids  -  -  i &apos;ll raise the roof .  i &apos;d rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers ,  than expire in a pan of dirty dish water . 
if you &apos;re going to be indiscreet ,  i wish you &apos;d be a little more discreet about it .  rich men ,  like winton ,  love you and leave you . 
you wouldn &apos;t have said that before you met her . 
oh !  mr .  igor !   -  -  i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re here  -  -  i don &apos;t know why i should be ,  but i was a little bit afraid . 
and how does one go about getting these human documents ,  may i inquire ? 
oh ,  you won &apos;t  -  -  you were pretty tough about judge ramsey  -  -  a little while ago  -  - 
on the square ,  jimmy ,  if you &apos;d seen winton down there  -  -  i &apos;m not holding a brief for him  -  -  maybe he &apos;s a dirty pup ,  but he &apos;s scared and hysterical  -  -  and so kinda dumb and worthless  .  .  . 
which one is me ?  the horse ? 
listen ,  jo - jo .  does this mean anything to you ?  joan gale &apos;s body swiped from the morgue  -  -  did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask ? 
you didn &apos;t happen to be going to worth &apos;s place ,  did you ? 
oh ,  yeah ?  maybe she didn &apos;t commit suicide .  she may have been murdered ! 
make it snappy ,  colonel . 
where &apos;d you get the stag hound ? 
he might get some publicity out of it . 
well ,  i &apos;ll tell you a secret .  i kinda like the old gent and i &apos;m trying to build a special sunday magazine story out of him .  it might help him a whole lot .  but that &apos;s a side issue  -  -  something i do on my own time . 
listen ,  kid .  you &apos;re in a tough spot ,  and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry - baby stuff  -  - 
i see .  was that all she said ? 
that happens to be the truth . 
it doesn &apos;t usually take that long ,  but i &apos;ll forgive you  -  -  you were in a tough spot when i met you . 
my partner believes that i should build a horror chamber ,  immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of london .  at such times marie antoinette has reassured me ,  she has promised me recognition for the devotion i gave to her . 
is that a fact ? 
you &apos;ve got to permit it !  whose fault is it that no one comes here ?  the museum at walston lane does well enough ,  and why ?  they &apos;ve got jack the ripper ,  burke and hare ,  the mad butcher ,  the demon barber of fleet street and things people pay to see . 
i wouldn &apos;t feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight ,  mr .  igor .  the weather was against you ,  and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow . 
shall we unpack it ? 
why am i doing this ? 
we flopped the first time out . 
nothing is real until it &apos;s perceived . 
but who were they ? 
it &apos;s so terrible i can &apos;t tell you .  oh ,  buddy ,  you don &apos;t know how it hurts to have a broken heart ,  what a terrible feeling it is ,  and i &apos;ve had a broken heart so many times .  men ,  i don &apos;t understand them ,  i can &apos;t figure them out and they break my heart ,  that &apos;s all .  i can &apos;t find mr .  right ,  buddy ,  i can &apos;t find him no matter how hard i look ,  all i find is a whole pile of mr .  wrongs .  but this is the worst ever because it wasn &apos;t his fault .  it was my fault ,  oh yes ,  my fault ,  i was bad  -  -  oh god ,  i was bad ,  you wouldn &apos;t believe how bad i was . 
why ,  it has just made me ill ,  buddy .  i &apos;m sick .  i don &apos;t want to eat nothin &apos; ,  i don &apos;t ,  and me i got a good appetite ,  that ain &apos;t nat &apos;ral for me .  i &apos;m ill . 
promise not to tell doll ?   -  -  or nobody ?  buddy ,  it &apos;s your daddy !  i &apos;m so much in love with him i am out of my mind ! 
rose ,  can &apos;t i see what the nipple on it is like ? 
buddy ,  you wouldn &apos;t tell nobody ,  would you ? 
i got an awful toothache . 
i guess i &apos;ll work as a waitress ,  buddy .  i done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know ,  but i can &apos;t stay here no more .  why did you get rid of your rabbits ,  buddy ? 
boy did i get sick of rabbit .  but later on after momma died and daddy wasn &apos;t doin &apos; nothin &apos; but drinkin &apos; ,  i sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew .  you know ,  i oughtn &apos;t to of told you about what daddy done when i was a child .  until them rabbits ruined him ,  he was a real good man ,  buddy . 
yeah ,  i know . 
he did lie ,  and .  .  .  and .  .  .  and mother ,  yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook ! 
daddy says rose is calm as lettuce .  do you believe that ,  doll ? 
he had his hand on her titty . 
what &apos;s goin &apos; on ? 
a baby .  .  .  and she isn &apos;t even married . 
is her husband sick or something ? 
you know ,  i don &apos;t know this town any more .  all this traffic ,  new buildings ,  prosperity .  .  .   where have the years gone ,  daddy ?  where is the little town i knew as a boy ? 
it &apos;s funny you would mention rose ,  i was thinking about her all the way up in the car .   or maybe it isn &apos;t so funny . 
well ,  i &apos;ll admit i don &apos;t see any flies on her yet . 
well ,  let &apos;s hope for the best ,  darlin &apos; . 
all right ,  darlin &apos; ,  don &apos;t go off into the fourth dimension . 
forgive my crudity ,  darlin &apos; .  i don &apos;t understand these deeper things the way you do . 
i &apos;ll drive you ,  darlin &apos; .  you &apos;ve got no business behind the wheel of an automobile .  you don &apos;t think about what you &apos;re doing and you &apos;ll run into a telephone pole . 
who doesn &apos;t have such thoughts ?   we &apos;d better get going . 
i don &apos;t think you understand her .  it isn &apos;t sex she wants ,  it &apos;s love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it . 
well ,  i wish you &apos;d stop criticizing and picking on her . 
i am not being brutal to her ! 
now you listen to me ,  rose  -  - 
i said i don &apos;t intend to fire her .  i just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth ,  that &apos;s all . 
rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed .   i hope she &apos;ll be all right ,  but i still think we ought to fire her . 
it has been three weeks since i  &quot; fired &quot;  her .  is there no way to get rid of this girl ?  are we stuck with her for life ? 
ahh - hem !  now ,  rose ,  get off my lap .  what are you doing ,  girl ?  are you crazy ? 
where do you want me to let you out ,  rose ? 
ahh - hh ,  you &apos;ll like it .  it &apos;s a fine ,  outdoor - type job . 
i haven &apos;t had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big . 
excuse me .  .  .  your voice is familiar and i &apos;m sure i know you from somewhere .  .  . 
well ,  i .  .  .  i .  .  .  ah - h ,  let &apos;s see .  .  . 
ha ha ,  course you make a lot more .   what &apos;s that you got there ,  buddy ? 
she didn &apos;t marry him ,  though ,  later she married another guy and went to winston - salem .  it didn &apos;t last that girl couldn &apos;t have no lastin &apos; marriage ,  she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west .  little bitch left him ,  too ,  and you know what she &apos;s married to right now ?   a kike .  that &apos;s right ,  some kind of kike horse doctor named schapiro out in seattle ,  who &apos;s got the nerve to have the same first name i got .  wouldn &apos;t you know it ,  rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike ?  she was always out of her friggin &apos; head and i &apos;ll tell you why .   buddy ,  she was sick in her mind and between her legs ,  too .  she was a nymphomaniac . 
yes ,  dear ,  what is it ? 
don &apos;t worry ,  madam ,  she can &apos;t infect your dear little kiddies .  she long ago fully recovered ,  but the disease did irreparable damage .  the girl is permanently barren . 
mother .  .  .  is rose going to die ? 
i &apos;m not goin &apos; in there ,  i don &apos;t like the looks of it ! 
oh - h ,  mrs .  hillyer ,  i .  .  .  i can &apos;t think .  i .  .  .  i &apos;m not really sure . 
what .  .  .  what makes you think you can order me around ?  ! 
what eve and i wouldn &apos;t give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain . 
you &apos;re zimmermann &apos;s calculator ,  archie .   all the blood money you had to move around to make this deal ,  you got to know something .   maybe they told you ,  maybe you overheard things you weren &apos;t supposed to hear .  .  . 
what do you want ?   i &apos;m clean .   i been clean a long time . 
escort everyone &apos;s favorite she - male over here nice and peaceful - like .  let &apos;s not have another incident like at the laundromat .   i &apos;ll never forget the look on that poor woman &apos;s face .

my goodness !  artoo ,  why did you have to be so brave ?

i &apos;m afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash . 
yes .  it &apos;s you leia . 
sister !  so .  .  . you have a twin sister .  your feelings have now betrayed her ,  too .  obi - wan was wise to hide her from me .  now his failure is complete .  if you will not turn to the dark side ,  then perhaps she will .

the champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will  -  -  balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face  -  -  creed doesn &apos;t look the best he &apos;s ever been but is moving smoothly  -  -  creed snaps out a triple combination that backs balboa into a corner  -  -  oh ,  a solid hook by creed ,  a master of fist - men .

my advice ?   hop on over to reno ,  get yourself a quickie divorce . 
what the hell are you doin &apos; ? 
wrong number ? 
keep reading .  .  . 
no better ? 
your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure . 
romeo !  romeo ! 
i aim &apos;d so near ,  when i supposed you loved . 
young son ,  it argues a distemper &apos;d head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed :  or if not so so ,  then here i hit it right ,  our romeo hath not seen his bed tonight . 
be plain ,  good son ,  and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift . 
what ,  daughter are you busy ?  need you my help ? 
 &#93 within] juliet ! 
where is my mother !  how oddly thou repliest !  your love says ,  like an honest gentleman ,  where is your mother ?  &apos;
i have . 
good pilgrim ,  you do wrong your hand too much ,  which mannerly devotion shows in this; for saints have hands that pilgrims &apos; hands do touch ,  and palm to palm is holy palmers &apos; kiss . 
saints do not move ,  though grant for prayers &apos; sake . 
thou know &apos;st the mask of night is on my face ,  else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak to - night fain would i dwell on form ,  fain ,  fain deny what i have spoke :  but farewell compliment !  dost thou love me ?  i know thou wilt say  &apos;ay ,  &apos; and i will take thy word :  yet if thou swear &apos;st ,  thou mayst prove false .  o gentle romeo ,  if thou dost love ,  pronounce it faithfully : 
do not swear at all; or ,  if thou wilt ,  swear by thy gracious self ,  which is the god of my idolatry ,  and i &apos;ll believe thee . 
a thousand times the worse ,  to want thy light .  love goes toward love ,  as schoolboys from their books ,  but love from love ,  toward school with heavy looks . 
by the hour of nine . 
that light is not daylight ,  i know it ,  i .  it is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to mantua .  therefore stay yet .  thou needest not be gone . 
this night you shall behold him at our feast; read o &apos;er the volume of young paris &apos; face ,  and find delight writ there with beauty &apos;s pen; this precious book of love ,  this unbound lover ,  to beautify him ,  only lacks a cover :  so shall you share all that he doth possess ,  by having him ,  making yourself no less . 
why ,  may one ask ? 
good king of cat &apos;s ,  nothing but one of your nine lives . 
nurse . 
do you have it ? 
then swede and i split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous . 
this .  .  . this is incredible .  is the rest of europe like this ? 
when we &apos;re done with this ,  i want to do for that one myself . 
so you thought that maybe i &apos;d grown too attached to this charade i &apos;ve been playing ,  is that it ? 
problem my ass !   i think you &apos;re lying to me ,  and if you are you &apos;re a dead man ! 
from interpol ? 
good christ !   can &apos;t you lose these jokers ? 
i feel as if i &apos;ve wandered onto the set of enter the dragon .   could you teach me to do that ? 
i still am . 
i better be getting that . 
now ,  what did we steal ? 
because if they had she &apos;d be gone along with the package ,  instead of sitting here with us . 
where do you get off saying word one ?  all the time pretending to be one of us ,  it &apos;s the same thing we were doing ,  seamus and myself .   and here you are so high and mighty ,  like you &apos;re so different from the rest of us . 
where &apos;s the case ? 
that fucking figures .  .  . 
perhaps we could both go at the same time .  .  . 
sit ,  sit .  .  .   would you like one ? 
if you &apos;re lying to me you poor excuse for a human being ,  i &apos;m gonna blow your brains all over this car . 
don &apos;t talk to me unless you tell me what i want to hear ,  understand ?  !  ?   you have no choice in this ,  don &apos;t think about winning ,  think about staying alive .   i want the item ,  and if you don &apos;t give it to me ,  i &apos;m gonna kill you . 
so what do we do ? 
a means to an end ,  is that it ? 
he &apos;s tough ,  your american friend . 
american . 
soon . 
long enough to shoot back . 
i don &apos;t particularly like killing ,  tubby ,  but i want you to know that this one i &apos;m going to enjoy . 
perhaps the police ? 
what &apos;d you say to him ? 
help yourself .   since when do you smoke ? 
how did you know ? 
i came up here to sneak a smoke . 
it was at that . 
you &apos;re a cop .  .  . you &apos;re a fucking cop .  .  . i should kill you . 
tell me ,  sam :  why do you do this ? 
i &apos;m a field agent  -  -  last of an already extinct breed .   i do dark ops . 
dark operations .   wet work .   kidnaping .  assassination . 
what the fuck happened ? 
not here .   they might see it . 
because i don &apos;t walk away . 
what &apos;s the story ? 
last i heard there was a film rep for the irish players staying at this address ,  name of seamus reilly . 
you slept with her ! 
i was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new . 
can you get it ? 
tony and i have to talk some business ,  first . 
what the hell happened here ? 
it won &apos;t work . 
i do .   it &apos;s little shit like that sends people to jail !  we have to cover all the bases if we &apos;re going to pull this ! 
shhh ! 
shit !   we &apos;re gonna have to get rid of him .   i &apos;m not letting some gangbanger ruin my life .   we can &apos;t risk it . 
he &apos;s going to be trouble . 
maybe we can reason with jesse ,  give him a third in exchange for the tape . 
not bad enough to kill him . 
you don &apos;t know if he was really gonna  -  - 
what happened ?   what &apos;s earl doing here ? 
we got to get out of here .   do you understand ?   we got to get out of here right now ! 
what &apos;s wrong ? 
nothing &apos;s wrong . 
you got me something ?   what &apos;s the occasion ? 
it doesn &apos;t matter .  .  . he &apos;s next to you .   you know ,  i always say to myself ,  you should have left him years ago .  why didn &apos;t you ? 
sally ,  do you love me ? 
be more specific .   a month ,  a week .  .  . 
and what &apos;s that ? 
he kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who &apos;s who ,  what was said ,  what &apos;s happening .   i contacted your local coroner ,  and he found it taped to his back . 
we don &apos;t know .   whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system . 
well you can understand why we didn &apos;t say anything .   if word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us . 
some of it .   denning only handled a small portion of the total ,  but it looks like this was one of his bills . 
anything i can help you with ? 
yeah ,  she is .   she comes up to about here on me . 
shopping here ? 
well .  .  . i should have done a little homework ,  getting all the sizes ,  and what not . 
just goes to show you . 
jesse ? 
why ? 
about what ? 
nothing .   nothing &apos;s the matter .  sally aren &apos;t you going to tell how your day went ? 
well you might as well say it .  mister small time .  .  . 
don &apos;t you want to hear about my day ? 
whatever .  .  . 
no ,  dwayne ,  you go ahead and relax ,  have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the tv ,  and come upstairs and pass out .   and do it all over again tomorrow ! 
you want to see how more unglued i can get ?   try me . 
what the hell are you doing ,  you crazy some bitches  -  - 
i don &apos;t suppose you &apos;ll tell us where the tape is . 
hi ma . 
are you hungry ? 
well what do you know !   an air conditioner . 
not in the trunk . 
is it true ,  carter ?   are you in hong kong right now ? 
do you know what happened yesterday ,  carter ?   i was officially nominated for the commissioner &apos;s post for the lapd .  there was a dinner last night ,  two hundred lapd officers were there . 
you assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five - hundred dollars a roll ,  is that right ?   are you a racist ? 
two - hundred thousand ! 
winner !   four ,  winner ! 
how you doing ,  baby ?   my name is prince mubutu from nigeria . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  you looked like you traveled in the best circles .   but hey ,  i understand .   make yourself at home ,  isabella .   champagne ,  caviar ,  whatever you want .   my ship is your ship . 
it &apos;s a myth .   some kind of counterfeit . 
how &apos;re they getting into the u . s .  mint to use the presses ?

you &apos;re sorry .   i got somebody &apos;s old chopsticks stuck in my ass ,  so don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re sorry .   just take me home . 
not yu .   you ! 
what are you gonna do about it ,  grasshopper ? 
five years ago ,  my father was chief inspector working a big international smuggling case . 
all the evidence against him disappeared ,  the smuggling case was unsolved .   tan resigned and went over to the triads openly . 
who ? 
just tell me where i can find this steven reign . 
the truth is ,  i haven &apos;t had any mu - shu in six months . 
i wouldn &apos;t do that !  !  ! 
look ,  man i &apos;m sorry .   i know you got a thing for her . 
if she was the right girl ,  you &apos;d be thinking about her . 
steamed dumplings ?

vegas .  .  . 
red dragon . 
that your gate down there ? 
i &apos;m this way .   i guess this is goodbye . 
your father &apos;s badge ?   no way ,  man .   i can &apos;t take this . 
i could use a little vacation . 
i didn &apos;t know which side you were on . 
lee ,  there was a bombing at the american embassy .   two american translators were killed . 
lee ,  we just got a call from the harbor patrol .   ricky tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight .   victoria harbor .   if you don &apos;t want to .  .  . 
escort detective carter to the airport  -  - 
he was the best i ever trained ,  you know . 
the answers you seek can be found in heaven on earth . 
what you did was dangerous and completely outside policy . 
you talk very fast . 
right .  .  .  . 
you talk too fast . 
let &apos;s get us a photo and description .  we &apos;ll have an apb out while we stake out the restaurant . 
are you tellin &apos; me nobody knows what he looks like ?   come on ,  there must be witnesses somewhere . 
that &apos;s not how it goes . 
want some ? 
excuse me ? 
ok ,  when you go in ,  just act like you &apos;re from outa town . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  lee . 
hey ,  baby ,  it &apos;s cool .   captain just reassigned me to the feds . 
you don &apos;t like it ? 
how much they want ? 
 .  .  .  the director considers this top priority ,  considering he is a chinese national and here under difficult circumstances .   his name is lee .   and he is to be shown every courtesy .  within reason . 
what kind of assignment is that ? 
yo ,  johnson .  .  . 
and mr .  lee ?   where is he ? 
i don &apos;t believe you .   my father was explaining to mr .  griffin .   that is how i found out . 
you look awful . 
god .  .  .  of course .   i &apos;m sorry  -  -  i mean ,  i &apos;m .  .  .   brian  -  -  i &apos;ve got to go .   the man &apos;s a lunatic ,  but i know exactly where he &apos;s going next . 
he wanted to know how you used to like your eggs . 
bob &apos;s in a hurry . 
i love his eyes .   i just believe they &apos;re listening to you . 
rub your ears . 
i didn &apos;t cook up a story .   i had a source . 
fisher ,  let him talk . 
vindication .   how would you like to get some ?   a chance to prove that ,  though your facts weren &apos;t entirely straight ,  your theory was correct . 
yes ,  well ,  my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention .  .  .  negative attention is attention .  like when women whack you on the street because of your column ,  that &apos;s negative attention . 
well ,  i &apos;m off .   a reporter &apos;s work is never done .   mrs .  pressman ,  thank you . 
that &apos;s fair . 
everest .   is that right ? 
give me that ! 
my magazine doesn &apos;t pay because for stories .   it &apos;s not what you call ethical . 
no ,  i &apos;m not afraid .   just .  .  .  maybe someday . 
it was one of the most wonderful moments of my life .   cal ripken even applauded . 
no .   i think i said something eloquent like ,   &quot; so ,  uh  -  -  maybe we should ,  ya know .   what do you think ?  &quot; 
you look .  .  .  uh .  .  .  you look fine . 
your filter &apos;s clogged .   this takes unleaded . 
no .   but i think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness .  attraction is very misleading .   and if it &apos;s mutual ,  it &apos;s well ,  terribly distracting . 
what !  ? 
okay .   so .  .  .  what ,  uh .  .  .  what just happened ?   just now ?   jus then ?   in there ? 
you actually could make breaking and entering into a new career .   so ,  what are you doing here ? 
you &apos;re a goddess ! 
i &apos;m going to kill myself . 
but you haven &apos;t lost your mystery !  you &apos;re very mysterious ! 
i &apos;m not worried about you and cory or cory and me or even that you &apos;re irreversibly screwed up .   but ,  maggie ,  you &apos;ve been like this since we were kids .   and i think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people &apos;s feelings ,  maybe it &apos;s time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own ,  like bob ,  if he &apos;s the one . 
something that brings warmth to my heart .   duckbill platypus . 
grandma ! 
want to go to butch &apos;s for a drink or something ? 
what are you talking about ? 
you tell maggie . 
no ,  no .   you &apos;re her best friend . 
how about  .  .  .  you &apos;re too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long -  term way . 
boats .   you go out in them .  you come back in them .   i hate them . 
but it &apos;s on the water . 
am i what they had in mind ? 
don &apos;t touch them .   i feel terrible sneezing at a time like this .   this is a big moment for me  -  - 
it &apos;s delicious ,  trust me . 
i am .   i was just .  .  .  i just got .  .  .  i think i got nervous .   it &apos;s normal ,  right ?  don &apos;t you ever feel nervous about ,  you know ? 
walter . 
beautiful view ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
oh ,  walter .   i don &apos;t deserve you . 
and now 2 , 000 women want his number .   the guy could be a crackhead ,  a psychopath ,  a flasher ,  a junkie ,  a transvestite ,  a chain - saw murderer ,  or someone really sick ,  like rick . 
your destiny can be your doom .  look at me and rick . 
you want to hear about destiny ?  if my husband hadn &apos;t gone on a diet ,  which caused me to leave him ,  i would never have been on that flight to miami ,  and met rick ,  and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says  &quot; vacant - occupied ,  vacant -  occupied ,  vacant - occupied &quot;   -  -  
can too . 
i love that dream . 
becky ? 
 &quot; dear annie :  thanks for your letter .   it was great .   we &apos;re very excited about meeting you in new york on valentine &apos;s day and seeing if we are m . f . e . o .  sleepless in seattle .  &quot; 
i need to know about him because .  .  .  he &apos;s involved with my sister .  .  . 
i &apos;ll tell you the truth ,  i heard this guy on a call - in radio show and i might not marry the person i should marry because i &apos;ve become obsessed with him . 
honey ,  he wasn &apos;t right for you . 
oh god ,  it &apos;s major .   he &apos;s kissing her on the lips .   i have to stop this . 
i don &apos;t even know him .   but i &apos;m having all these fantasies about a man i &apos;ve never met ,  who lives in seattle . 
it &apos;s probably just the flowers  -  - 
oh ,  please .   destiny &apos;s just something we &apos;ve invented because we can &apos;t stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental . 
you know . 
magic .   it was magic . 
so you &apos;ll get married in a new dress . 
hello . 
why not ? 
where &apos;s your mom ? 
i &apos;m sorry to hear that ,  jonah . 
just because someone &apos;s looking for a nice guy doesn &apos;t make them desperate . 
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to tell you .   what women are looking over ,  okay ?  pecs and a cute butt . 
you &apos;ll find out . 
do you know how much it costs to go to new york ? 
do you want a fruit plate ? 
how did they get our phone number ? 
in the movies women are always scratching up guy &apos;s back and screaming and stuff .   when they &apos;re having sex . 
bye bye blackbird . 
i miss her .   what do you think happens to someone after they die ? 
this one &apos;s for both of us . 
jonah ! 
did you call that radio station again ? 
this is not a joke .   thank god victoria doesn &apos;t know .   it would really have hurt her feelings . 
what if i couldn &apos;t get to you ? 
listen ,  have i ever done anything really stupid ? 
i mean ,  so far ,  have i screwed it up for you ? 
what do you mean ,  okay ?  wouldn &apos;t you like a dog ? 
hi ,  sam .   and let me guess  -  -  you must be jonah . 
do you like baseball ? 
what about camping ? 
do you like it ? 
is he there ? 
mornin &apos; . 
well ? 
you haven &apos;t tried locking them up ! 
got any more ideas ? 
question ,  question  -  -  the problem ,  what to do about  &apos;em . 
hear you had a little trouble ,  quintero .  defective fuse ?   well ,  you &apos;re all in one piece .  so what &apos;s the beef ? 
who ?  a scab ? 
can we light the candles now ?  on the cake ? 
he can &apos;t drink this milk .  it &apos;ll make him sick .  he &apos;s on a formula .   i was a fool !  i shouldn &apos;t have kept him with me . 
but you had to have it ,  didn &apos;t you ?  it was so nice to listen
is that all you care about ?  that radio ?  can &apos;t you think of anything except yourself ? 
was it expensive ,  the beer ? 
but the motion passed .  it &apos;s  .  .  .  it &apos;s not democratic of you to  .  .  . 
you might get hurt .   listen ,  if you think i &apos;m gonna play nursemaid from now on ,  you &apos;re crazy  .  .  .  i &apos;ve had these kids all day ! 
i &apos;m telling you .  i don &apos;t stay home with these kids tomorrow . 
how do you feel ? 
but if you go back they &apos;ll lock you up again . 
i waited up till midnight . 
what are you doing here ?   something wrong with mama ? 
where &apos;s your mama ? 
but papa  -  -  you need all the help you can get . 
and another thing .  your attitude toward anglos .  if you &apos;re gonna be a leader  .  .  . 
what is it ? 
yeah . 
i ain &apos;t a idiot ,  asshole . 
could be worse .   oh sorry ,  forgot who i was talking to . 
it &apos;s not that easy . 
 :  what are you up to ? 
so you &apos;re just attracted to me ,  is that it ? 
how much time do you have ? 
what are you hiding ,  danny ? 
he knows where i work . 
all right ,  nancy ,  how &apos;d you track me down ? 
how the hell did we get this detail ? 
what time is it ? 
i &apos;m hurting . 
why does it have to feel so bad ? 
what ? 
hey ,  why do you need a gun and a vest anyway ? 
yeah ,  that &apos;s what i mean .   where the hell does this guy live anyway ? 
you don &apos;t understand . 
i &apos;m gonna get this developed and send it to the warren commission . 
not bad . 
so that &apos;s 40 lbs .  at 6 a pound then ? 
danny ,  i &apos;m touched . 
you &apos;ve got no choice . 
what &apos;s that smell ? 
and he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it . 
you think that &apos;s a good idea ? 
just no pleasing you ,  is there ? 
we all know how much you like hearing that .  okay ,  liz ,  i was wrong .  there .   you happy ? 
golly ,  i hadn &apos;t thought of that . 
resistance ? 
alright ,  i &apos;ll give you that .  continue . 
good luck ,  john . 
i don &apos;t make jokes about things of ,  or related to ,  the preaching of the holy gospel ,  including the ministerial calling of my family . 
yep . 
he ain &apos;t half - bad ,  i guess . 
we left them eighty - eights . 
i &apos;m in my backyard ,  lying in my hammock ,  with my arm around my wife ,  listening for the sound of breaking glass . 
a paratrooper named ryan .   he &apos;s going home ,  if he &apos;s alive . 
glad of it . 
sir ,  i &apos;m sorry about what happened ,  i .  .  . 
it seemed appropriate . 
he &apos;s right ,  captain ,  it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys . 
it &apos;s not normal ,  not reading letters from home . 
hold your fire ! 
yeah ,  vecchio ,  i couldn &apos;t remember his name ,  he was a good kid ,  remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze ? 
no problem .   a pair of deuces ?   less ?  so what ?   i bluff .   it used to tear me apart when i &apos;d get one of my men killed ,  but what was i supposed to do ?   break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do ?   of course not ,  so i bluffed ,  and after a while ,  i started to fall for my own bluff .  it was great ,  it made everything so much easier .   sarge is that why your hand &apos;s been shaking ? 
captain ,  can i put in for a transfer ? 
well ,  sir ,  in purely arithmetic terms ,  since when does six equal one ?   what &apos;s the sense in risking six guys to save one ? 
huh ? 
in addition ,  as i pointed out earlier ,  i have a fondness for cheese and i hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the ramelle products ,  when we arrive there ,  to see if they live up to their excellent reputation .  moreover ,  i feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of private james ryan and i &apos;m more than willing to lay down my life ,  and the lives of my men ,  especially you ,  reiben ,  to help relieve her suffering .   the men thoroughly enjoy the performance . 
looks like they &apos;ve been having a hell of a party ,  here ,  captain . 
goddamn it .  .  . goddamn it .  .  . goddamn it .  .  . 
yes ,  private . 
fine ,  you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned private james ryan can carry my fucking gear . 
damn fool .   sir . 
but everybody &apos;s heard of him ,  he won the congressional medal of honor ,  he saved a dozen men . 
sir ,  i ran the 220 in high school . 
how do you do it ? 
how can you ,  how can you say that ? 
the ,  uh ,  cynthia branson estate was worth how much ?   because her family .  .  . 
hmmm .   your income ,  mr court ,  hasn &apos;t changed substantially in seventeen years . 
why do you eat that stuff ?   there &apos;s no food in your food .   not too loud ,  the red line &apos;s there for a reason . 
do me a favor; take a picture of me with her . 
wait for me for when i get round to the front .  
alright . 
no ,  you &apos;re not a guy . 
did you see what mr carroll wrote in my yearbook ?   well ,  he ridiculed me all year long ,  and then he writes ,   &quot; you &apos;re a real live - wire ,  love mr carroll .  &quot;   y &apos;know ,  it &apos;s all so phoney . 
lloyd ,  it &apos;s us . 
wait a minute . 
i wrote sixty - three songs this year .   they &apos;re all about joe ,  and i &apos;m going to play every single one of them tonight . 
i can &apos;t give you that .   this guy &apos;s been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years .   he &apos;s been getting it from every end .   i &apos;d love to hear his story . 
lloyd ,  she &apos;s being difficult . 
no ,  wait a minute .   everybody thinks you &apos;re what ? 
i &apos;m sorry . 
what ? 
wait a minute .   how was lloyd ? 
oh yeah .   there was ,  uh ,  somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio ,  and ,  uh ,  we got this telephone call ,  this guy is making a sound effects record ,  and he &apos;d gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream . 
you &apos;ve always called before ,  always .   now i &apos;m not asking what you did ,  i just want to know that you &apos;re alright . 
but listen ,  if i had a friend in the same position ,  i would tell her to delay a year . 
i made their lives better . 
why are you being so hateful to me ?   is this because of lloyd ? 
thank - you .   the real world . 
no noise ,  no sound ,  no movement ,  nothing !   hello ,  diane ? 
are you busy on saturday ? 
actually ,  i think that i .  .  . 
i &apos;ll go . 
i &apos;ll go . 
thank - you . 
boy ,  this is a mother dictionary . 
me ?   sure i do . 
i think that &apos;s ageism ,  and that &apos;s ,  that &apos;s being prejudiced against people because they &apos;re old .   maybe their mouths don &apos;t work as well as yours . 
okay ,  bye . 
yes . 
if you &apos;ll just maybe ease it into second . 
i don &apos;t know .   i &apos;m happy . 
check your mail tomorrow .   i sent you a letter ,  a letter . 
it did ? 
how do you know what i &apos;m going to say ? 
i was just going to tell you that i love you .   i said it . 
well ,  i need to study ,  and .  .  . 
okay ,  what did we just decide ? 
it sounded like you did . 
i feel like a dick .   you must think i &apos;m a dick . 
you shared it with a dick . 
okay . 
sorry ,  diane isn &apos;t here at the moment . 
the truck ? 
yeah ,  she is .   good luck . 
hello .   heard about that graduation present .   really quite a car .  look ,  i know you &apos;re busy ,  you don &apos;t &apos; have to retain me ,  but you can trust me .   i &apos;ll tell you a couple of things about myself ,  i &apos;m nineteen ,  been overseas for a couple of semesters ,  but now i &apos;m back .   i &apos;m an athlete ,  so i rarely drink .   kickboxing .   you heard of kickboxing ,  sport of the future ?   don  &apos;the dragon &apos; wilson ,  lenny  &#93  ? ] merciless ,  one of the champions of the sport ?   i can see by your face ,  no .   my point is ,  you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours . 
hi ,  lloyd .   this is my eighth and final call .  .  . 
i know
just her name . 
i love you man . 
oskar  -  my friend lena . 
nothing &apos;s changed .   then again ,  something has changed ,  hasn &apos;t it ? 
you know what ,  you &apos;d like her . 
what  - 
i go to work the other day ,  there &apos;s nobody there .   nobody tells me about this ,  i have to find out ,  i have to go in ,  everybody &apos;s gone  - 
it &apos;s true .   never happen in cracow ,  though ,  we all love you too much . 
i tried to call you ,  i &apos;m running a little late ,  this is taking longer than i thought .   have a drink . 
oh ,  this is  &quot; good business &quot;  in your opinion .  you &apos;ve got to move them ,  the equipment ,  everything to czechoslovakia  -  it doesn &apos;t make any sense . 
this is not my problem . 
i work hard for you .   i &apos;ll continue to work hard for you . 
what are you doing ? 
i mean where have you been ?  nobody &apos;s seen you around for a while . 
jews ,  yeah .   investors . 
this ,  i don &apos;t know ,  maybe you can trade it for something . 
i got to go ,  i &apos;ll see you . 
you have to understand ,  goeth &apos;s under enormous pressure .   you have to think of it in his situation .   he &apos;s got this whole place to run ,  he &apos;s responsible for everything that goes on here ,  all these people  -  he &apos;s got a lot of things to worry about .   and he &apos;s got the war .  which brings out the worst in people .   never the good ,  always the bad .   always the bad .  but in normal circumstances ,  he wouldn &apos;t be like this .   he &apos;d be all right .   there &apos;d be just the good aspects of him .   which is a wonderful crook .   a guy who loves good food ,  good wine ,  the ladies ,  making money .  .  . 
we need to talk . 
there &apos;s a rumor you &apos;ve been going around miscalibrating the machines .   i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea . 
i know what you &apos;re saying ,  but i don &apos;t see the difference . 
i could &apos;ve got more  .  .  .  if i &apos;d just  .  .  .  i don &apos;t know ,  if i &apos;d just  .  .  .  i could &apos;ve got more .  .  . 
i can do it ,  captain . 
we don &apos;t know if it &apos;s random .  we haven &apos;t been able to connect the victims . 
oh ,  i &apos;m sorry .  my bad .   i thought you were someone else . 
i get my revenge and make some fast cash . 
do i know you ?  you look familiar . 
how are you ?  you weren &apos;t in class .  i called as soon as i heard .  .  . 
my screwed up life shouldn &apos;t have to bleed onto my friends . 
poor cotton ,  could life be a little more cruel ? 
she &apos;s got guards with her . 
we had to have financing . 
yes ,  miss weathers ,  your name is embedded clearly between my ears . 
you have every right to be upset . 
i never meant to imply .  .  . 
not good .  how you doin ? 
if you were truly a copycat ,  wouldn &apos;t you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could ? 
and it &apos;s sexier in the dark . 
the sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision . 
this is all too familiar . 
who are you ? 
where are you ? 
what do you want from me ? 
no ,  wait .  .  . 
i &apos;m sorry . 
it seems to be causing a stir .  what &apos;s with the toilet paper ? 
 &quot; if i should stay .  i would only be in your way .  so i &apos;ll go .  and yet ,  i know ,  i &apos;ll think of you each step of the way .  .  . 
what about rehearsal ? 
that was good . 
i gotta hit the library .  anatomy .  some of us have real majors .  you gonna be okay ,  sid ? 
i &apos;ll stop by the deltas tonight . 
she &apos;s not here right now . 
you ass . 
there &apos;s always someone out there stalking actors .  look at that woman from the commish . 
i did .  hon ,  although i got a total of six minutes screen time ,  they &apos;re the best six minutes of the movie . 
who is this ? 
what ?  ! 
listen ,  i &apos;m busy .  nobody has access to those files except studio execs .  can you please go away now ? 
that &apos;s sidney prescott &apos;s mother . 
four ?  there are five . 
i used to think i had the perfect mom ,  perfect family .   till i found out i was wrong .   she had a secret life ,  and i tried to understand that ,  and soon as i thought i had ,  more secrets .   i don &apos;t &apos; know who my mom was .   sometimes i feel like i &apos;m just learning about my mother for the first time .  you know ,  with tv and those movies and what not .  god sometimes i feel like i &apos;m just learning about myself for the first time .  like i &apos;m watching my life instead of living in it . 
that &apos;s fine mr .  rielly ,  but if anyone else should die ,  i &apos;m going to have to get a warrant . 
what about angelina tyler ?  she was there too . 
before you jump to conclusions ,  the man in the picture ,  cotton weary ,  is out of the country on business .  his alibi checks out .  seems he &apos;s got a tv show in australia ,  100% cotton .  it &apos;s supposedly the biggest thing down under since yahoo serious ,  but that &apos;s besides the point . 
is that a threat ,  detective ? 
sidney ,  do you have any idea how he could &apos;ve gotten your number ? 
don &apos;t worry ,  i &apos;ve got a permit for it . 
what about me ? 
off the record . 
two months ago ,  the woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with  &apos;stab 3 &apos; .   she wanted to see the file on sid ,  for research . 
you &apos;re not a detective . 
thank you . 
sidney ,  what happened ? 
gale ,  i know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again .  the whole relationship thing . 
so you knew sidney prescott &apos;s mother . 
good morning gale .  pleasure to be here . 
your life ? 
and i die naked ?  !   ugh !  this is complete bullshit .  who wrote this piece of crap ? 
shit !  where the hell are tom and angelina ? 
listen you sick bastard ,  what the fuck do you want ? 
being gale weathers .   what the hell are you doing ? 
here &apos;s how i see it .   i &apos;ve got no house ,  no movie ,  no gun ,  and i &apos;m being stalked .   because someone wants to kill me ?   no ,  because someone wants to kill you .  so now ,  starting now ,  i go where you go .   that way ,  if someone wants to kill me ,  i &apos;ll be with you ,  and since they really want to kill you ,  they won &apos;t kill me ,  they &apos;ll kill you .   make sense ? 
ha .  maybe i should join snl . 
but you know my favorite name ? 
it &apos;s not just a new script ,  it &apos;s a new movie . 
goddamnit i am getting so fed up with these re - writes .  it &apos;s like every five minutes there &apos;s a new script .  god ,  and you just know this all because of stab 2 &apos;s script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting . 
if you lay a hand on him i &apos;ll fucking kill you ! 
where ? 
how &apos;d you do ? 
thanks ,  butt wart .  you did good . 
you ready to party hard tonight ? 
that &apos;s it ,  billy .  i can &apos;t take any more .  i &apos;m feeling woozy . 
i thought she was dead . 
billy ?  what the .  .  . 
yeah ,  it was edited for tv .  all the good stuff was cut out and i started thinking about us and how two years ago ,  we started off kinda hot and heavy ,  a nice solid  &quot; r &quot;  rating on our way to an nc17 .  and how things have changed and ,  lately ,  we &apos;re just sot of .  .  .  edited for television . 
would you settle for a pg - 13 relationship ? 
no .  .  .  i don &apos;t .  .  .  it &apos;s just .  .  .  oh god ,  billy ,  someone was there ,  someone tried to kill me . 
who did you call ? 
when you &apos;re arrested  -  -  you &apos;re allowed one phone call ?  who did you call ? 
i thought you were .  .  . 
i &apos;m gonna rip you up bitch .  just like your slut whore mother . 
i don &apos;t know . 
look ,  enough is enough .  you had your fun now you better leave me alone or else . 
i lied .  i do have a boyfriend and he &apos;ll be here any second and your ass better be gone . 
so you better leave . 
i wanna play a game . 
afraid not . 
you tricked me .  .  . 
 .  .  . leave me alone .  .  .  please .  .  . 
really ?  you small town guys are good .  and have you located sidney &apos;s father ? 
if you &apos;ll excuse me ,  ma &apos;am . 
i just turned 25 .  i was 24 for a whole year . 
ma &apos;am ,  i am the deputy of this town . 
shit .  it &apos;s neil prescott &apos;s car . 
what are you doing here ? 
no ,  dewey .  you &apos;ll ruin the whole night . 
you gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit ? 
you girls ready . 
please .  you owe me . 
i think you falsely identified him .  yes . 
what if she did it ?  what if sidney killed casey and steve ? 
why would sidney want to be with steve ?  she has her own bubble - butt boyfriend billy . 
don &apos;t start .  you know i don &apos;t watch that shit . 
the question is not who am i .  the question is where am i ? 
that was an ice pick  -  -  not exactly the same . 
and are the police aware you dated the victim ? 
she &apos;s saving herself for you . 
i thought everything was checked out . 
there goes my chance with sid . 
so stu ,  what &apos;s your motive ?  billy &apos;s got one .  the police are on their way .  what are you going to tell them ? 
not anymore .  her parents found her hanging from a tree .  her insides on the outside . 
do you really think billy did it ? 
billy &apos;s right .  whenever he touches me ,  i just can &apos;t relax . 
how does that get you in the mood with stu ? 
no way . 
i thought you dumped her for me . 
you know if i were accused of carving up two people ,  i &apos;d take the opportunity to skip school . 
that &apos;s mature . 
with that set of lungs  -  -  she should be . 
how &apos;s that ? 
he cuts off the skin if his fingertips .  that &apos;s why we can &apos;t find a single usable print in the apartment .   he &apos;s been doing it for quite a while .   keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back . 
did you read in the paper today ,  about the man who was walking his dog ?   he was attacked ,  and his wallet and his watch were taken .   and then ,  while he was still lying unconscious ,  his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes .   it happened four blocks from here . 
they &apos;re hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go ,  but i told them not to expect it . 
what the hell &apos;s going on ? 
this guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here .   he wanted it here at exactly seven o &apos;clock . 
it &apos;s surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct . 
i .  .  .  i doubt i enjoyed it any more than .  .  .  detective mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows .   isn &apos;t that true ?   how happy would it make you to hurt me ,  with impunity ? 
i wish i could have been a normal man like you .   i wish i could have a simple life . 
there &apos;s a bucket here . 
seven terraces of purgation . 
no fingerprints ? 
what the fuck is that ? 
you meant what you said to mrs .  gould ,  didn &apos;t you ?   about catching this guy .   you really want to believe that ,  don &apos;t you ? 
and ? 
there must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow .   i mean ,  christ .  .  .  do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves . 
oh ,  blah ,  blah ,  blah .   the guy &apos;s insane . 
you &apos;re sure you &apos;re reading that right ?  john doe ? 
are you alright ? 
think about it .  .  . 
well ,  there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room ,  and near as i can tell ,  each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages . 
you know .  .  .  there &apos;s not going to be a happy ending to this .   it &apos;s not possible anymore . 
you tell me ,  then .  .  .  you walk into an apartment ,  and a man has beaten his wife to death ,  or the wife murdered the husband ,  and you have to wash the blood off their children .   you put the killer in jail .   who won ? 
oh ,  you &apos;re so much better than everyone ,  right ?   no one &apos;s worthy of you . 
you &apos;re talking about people who are mentally ill .   you &apos;re .  .  . 
you knew i &apos;d say yes . 
slut . 
are you absolutely certain ? 
i don &apos;t know ,  with this case . 
oh ,  tracy .  .  .  i have to tell you ,  i &apos;m not the one to talk to about this . 
now ,  ethan ,  i ain &apos;t sure .  .  . 
let &apos;s get along .  .  . 
why &apos;d they break off ?   was there water in that canyon ? 
charlie< / u> maccorry< / u> !  .  .  . you weren &apos;t fixin &apos; to marry him ?  ? 
it &apos;s all right .  .  . charlie ,  let &apos;s move outside . 
is this in the line of duty ,  sergeant ? 
haven &apos;t seen you since the surrender .   come to think of it ,  i didn &apos;t see you at< / u> the surrender . 
he cometh forth like a .  .  . 
what good does that do ? 
evenin &apos; .  .  . evenin &apos; reverend .  .  . or do i call you  &apos;captain &apos; .  .  .  ? 
i didn &apos;t want< / u> to tell you .  .  . but maybe it &apos;s your right to know . 
what in .  .  .  ? 
is captain clayton here ,  reverend ? 
you help me find her ,  you got your rockin &apos; chair .  .  . 
keep talking . 
all right .  .  . but i &apos;m givin &apos; the orders .  .  . you take  &apos;em or we split up here and now .  .  . 
say !  .  .  . what happened to your blanket ?  lose it ? 
what you goin &apos; to do ? 
say it .  we &apos;re beat ! 
he &apos;s agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while i &apos;m gone .  .  . i &apos;ll be pushin &apos; on tomorrow .  .  . 
well ,  you &apos;re a widower now .  .  . 
i &apos;m a woman ,  martie .  .  .   we wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives .  .  . when you &apos;re little we even wash you< / u> .  .  .  . how a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman i &apos;ll never know .  .  . 
take it and welcome .  .  . but don &apos;t count on finding me here when you get back .  .  . i &apos;ve been dallying around this god - forsaken wind - scour almost two long years waitin &apos; for you .  .  . i ain &apos;t cut out to be an old maid ! 
i .  .  . i wrote you a letter .  .  . reckon you didn &apos;t get it .  .  . 
martie .  .  . don &apos;t go !  not this time . 
hey ,  flower child ,  the sixties are over .   and this stuff is hazardous to your health . 
i was so excited about meeting you .  again and again ,  i kept getting in the back of the line so i could be the last to talk to you . 
will you finally cut it out ?   just in case you haven &apos;t noticed ,  i am trying to write a book here .   and maybe  -  even with your birdbrains  -  you can figure it &apos;s a pretty tough job .  so why can &apos;t you just leave me alone ? 
of course you &apos;ll give me the blame again .   like back then .   just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today  -  isn &apos;t that right ,  ellen ? 
what ? 
ellen . 
i really hate to bother him ,  but .  .  . 
and that is ? 
you didn &apos;t tell her ! 
you are a gentleman . 
i gave shakespeare two sovereigns for romeo ! 
here is two sovereigns -  - i &apos;ll give you two more when you show me the pages . 
most interesting . 
no ,  your marriage bed .

mr .  henslowe ,  will you lend me fifty pounds ? 
i feel a scene coming on . 
my tailor .  wants to be an actor .  i have a few debts here and there .  well ,  that seems to be everybody .  did you see a romeo ? 
cut round him for now . 
i have a new one nearly done ,  and better .  the massacre at paris . 
his best friend is killed in a duel by ethel &apos;s brother or something .  his name is mercutio . 
 &quot; good morrow ,  cousin .  &quot; 
 &quot; out .  &quot; 
did you like proteus or valentine best ?  proteus for speaking ,  valentine for looks . 
playhouses are not for well - born ladies . 
well - monied is the same as well - born and well - married is more so .  lord wessex was looking at you tonight . 
like valentine and silvia ? 
but playwrights teach nothing about love ,  they make it pretty ,  they make it comical ,  or they make it lust .  they cannot make it true . 
your majesty ! 
fifty shillings .   pounds . 
you left it in my bed .  come to look for it again . 
but your voice  have they dropped ? 
 &quot; have not saints lips ,  and holy palmers too ?  &quot; 
she will breed .  if she do not ,  send her back . 
what does burbage care of that ?  he is readying the curtain for kit marlowe . 
my lady ! 
alas indeed ,  for i thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart . 
wait !  you are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as i was mistook in thomas kent . 
oh ,  will ! 
i found something in my sleep .  the friar who married them will take up their destinies . 
to be the wife of a poor player ?  -  - can i wish that for lady viola ,  except in my dreams ?  and yet i would ,  if i were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day . 
he was not dead before .  i would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come . 
calf love .  i loved the writer ,  and gave up the prize for a sonnet . 
but all ends well . 
my lady viola . 
how your mind hops about !  your father was a shopkeeper ,  your children will bear arms ,  and i will recover my fortune .  that is the only matter under discussion today .  you will like virginia .

she tells me to keep away .  she is to marry lord wessex .  what should i do ? 
oh !  -  - it &apos;s -  - it &apos;s -  - oh ,  it &apos;s a house of ill -  repute !

squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination . 
i don &apos;t know . 
from what ?  jehovah &apos;s witnesses ? 
what &apos;s all this for ,  more security ? 
who ? 
they know .

whoever draws the short straw does it all .  that way ,  you either do it or you don &apos;t .  all or nothing . 
love and happiness for ever .

does she know about us ? 
hi ,  leonard . 
i think you &apos;re crazy .  don &apos;t look over ,  it &apos;s lenny silverman . 
it must be something . 
we don &apos;t think marriage is important . 
how much ? 
 -  -  he came up behind me and i was wiping a dish and he just .  .  .  lifted up my skirt ,  and ,  you know ,  right there .  .  . 
go ahead ,  jill ,  you can say it . 
well he &apos;s not exactly a friend . 
george ?  was he alone ? 
that bastard . 
i think they &apos;re waiting for somebody to start dinner .

yes . 
yeah . 
mom ?

mommy .  .  .  mommy .  .  .  ! 
now danny ,  when you were brushing your teeth ,  do you remember if you smelled anything funny ,  or saw any bright flashing lights ,  or anything at all strange ? 
please .  .  . 
mrs .  torrance ,  i don &apos;t think you have anything to worry about .   i &apos;m quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with danny . 
no . 
no need to rub it in ,  mr .  grady .  i &apos;ll deal with that situation as soon as i get out of here . 
good evening .   forest service . 
dick ,  can we borrow mrs .  torrance for a few minutes ?   we &apos;re on our way through to the basement  -  i promise we won &apos;t keep her very long . 
glad to meet you ,  winifred . 
oh wendy .   that &apos;s nice .   that &apos;s the prettiest . 
beg pardon ?

no ,  we don &apos;t mind . 
eh  -  formerly a school - teacher . 
nothing that i can &apos;t handle though ,  lloyd .   thanks . 
what do you want me to do about it ? 
somebody did that to him . 
have you ever thought about my responsibilities ? 
stay .  .  .  stay away ! 
i &apos;m gonna go now . 
mr .  ullman ? 
have any trouble finding us ? 
right there . 
even before anybody knew what a jet set was .   we &apos;ve had four presidents who stayed here ,  lots of movie stars . 
you always take his side because he &apos;s a cripple !  well ,  it &apos;s not my fault that he &apos;s a cripple ! 
please ,  uncle al . 
well ,  i &apos;m not sure that was .  christ !  they better get the guy . 
huh ? 
it isn &apos;t enough that the monster killed all those people -  that he killed brady .  now he &apos;s got them to cancel the fair . 
no .  .  .  but i found some blood ,  smeared on a tree trunk in that grove . 
it could have been anything ,  marty . 
what if i say no ? 
i haven &apos;t enjoyed mass this much in years .   what a marvelous program .  innovative .   inspiring .   you are to be commended . 
really . 
let thy thoughts be guided
let thy spirit
well ,  what about the sex stuff ?   what if some dude is after you ,  and he &apos;s always saying stuff ,  commin &apos; on sweet and mellow .   like ,  oh ,  baby ,  you know you &apos;ll love it .   oh ,  baby ,  if you loved me ,  you &apos;d stay . 
what you do ? 
i want us to be together .   like people .  honest ,  decent people .   in the eyes of god .   babe ,  today .  .  .  i went to confession . 
babe ,  it &apos;s not me !   i love you !   it &apos;s god ! 
right here .   let the others go  -  -  they have nothing to do with this . 
this prom is a real drag . 
the minute i saw you .  i said to myself ,  she &apos;s a weaver .   have you ever used a loom ? 
isn &apos;t it lovely ?   now i &apos;ll demonstrate ,  and then you can hop right in .   you just draw your beater in ,  keep it pressed against the pick ,  and open the shed .   then pass your shuttle ,  beat ,  and open the next shed .   shuttle .  beat ,  beat ,  shuttle ,  beat ,  shed .   keep tension on the warp .   is that clear ? 
shuttle ,  beat ,  shed .   and watch your heddles . 
hold on . 
spring is here the sun will shine i &apos;ll be his and he &apos;ll be mine we &apos;ll love until the end of time and we &apos;ll never be lonely anymore
but then came an angel who whispered these words
don &apos;t look at your feet ,  and i don &apos;t want to see anybody counting .   make it look easy .   again ! 
no ,  you don &apos;t understand  -  -  i don &apos;t want to get out !   i want to get in ? 
we need experience . 
mary clarence !   you &apos;re so .  .  .  different from the other sisters .   sometimes ,  well .  .  .  sometimes you sound more like a layperson . 
it &apos;s contraband .   don &apos;t ask .   but i wanted to give you a treat .   a sort of .  .  .  thank - you gift . 
but what do they want ?   where are we going ? 
that &apos;s my real name !   currently i &apos;m a singer .   sort of . 
fine .   got it .   look ,  the way i see it ,  i &apos;m stuck here ,  right ?   i mean ,  i &apos;m here or i &apos;m target practice .   so here &apos;s the deal  -  -  i don &apos;t bug you ,  you don &apos;t bug me .   i &apos;ll catch up on some sleep ,  watch some tube ,  lay back and lay low .   so just get me a key and show me to my room ,  and do not disturb .   capisce ? 
right .   so what do we do now ?   ping -  pong ?   row over to the monastery ? 
sometimes it &apos;s not enough ! 
you and i know that life is not so simple .   there will be disappointments .  rude shocks .   and you will have vanished .  how .  .  .  fortunate . 
what about me ,  reverend mother ?   i think you were right .   i &apos;m just a bad influence .   sister show biz . 
jesus ,  what do you think this is  -  -  wheel of fortune ?   let me spell it out for you .   you have to hide like you don &apos;t even exist .   you have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight . 
i hate you .   i totally hate you . 
like what ? 
eddie !   you scared the hell out of me ! 
i really can &apos;t talk about it now .   the place is packed .   sro .   i &apos;ve got a show to do . 
i &apos;ve got a show  -  -  at st .  matthew &apos;s cathedral .   we &apos;re singing for the cardinals . 
they need you ?   a bunch of nuns ?   for what ?   moral guidance ?   make - up tips ? 
we could put you into our witness protection program . 
right . 
i figured if you were gonna ,  then i wouldn &apos;t have to . 
strip down a nun ?   you want us to fry ? 
mary clarence  -  -  how is your weaving progressing ? 
mary clarence !   sister ! 
you mean  -  -  they kidnapped her ? 
mary clarence  -  -  you &apos;re alive ! 
but she &apos;s been exposed to the underside of life .   she is the underside of life . 
soon ,  you gorgeous thing .  .  .  tell me .  .  .  how lonely ? 
if we could speak alone . 
who took the meat ? 
what the hell are you doing ? 
we must be a curious sight to him . 
the wounds are the same .   cauterized .  no chopping or half - measures either .  one stroke took the head .   have you seen ,  doctor .  .  .   ?   even the spinal bone .  .  .  sliced as smooth as butter . 
you need to sleep . 
no clotting or gathering of pus .   no healing at all . 
why not tell us what you have heard ?  hmm ?   how much have your superiors bothered to tell you ? 
your superiors are two days away ! 
wallowing quite literally in blood . 
taken .   taken by the headless horseman .   taken back to hell . 
just a moment .  .  .  if i may .   it is possible this man was murdered . 
he will be burned pursuant to statutes of health . 
very few ,  if any . 
there is a farming community upstate ,  constable .  .  .  ten days journey north in the hudson highlands .   it is named sleepy hollow .   within a fortnight ,  three persons have been murdered there .  each with their head lopped cleanly off .   the elders of the hollow have sent dispatches to me ,  requesting assistance ,  and now ,  just this very moment ,  i have chosen you . 
just so .   granted .   and so you take your experimentations to sleepy hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place .   bring him here to face our good justice .  will you do this for me ? 
the widow windsor . 
i am not here for revenge .   i am here to bring justice . 
what is the common thread between these victims ? 
the lenape indian had much to tell once i opened his mouth . 
no ,  i couldn &apos;t .  .  . 
thank you . 
if the western woods are truly the devil &apos;s glen ,  we will see for ourselves . 
we are leaving . 
then ,  who murdered the old crone ?   and why ? 
there is no masbath here .   my father &apos;s loan papers are missing . 
won &apos;t you change your mind ,  sir ?  what can i say to convince you ? 
climb up ! 
did they tell ?   it is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone .   according to the elders ,  an indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken ,  and spells cast then still linger to this day . 
yes ,  but listen .   the illusion is easily explained .   the eye retains each image ,  till they combine .   and yet ,  some would call this toy magic . 
must i hear this ? 
and this gives worth to butchery ? 
allow me some time .   i have spent every hour in the company of others .  i need to be alone . 
i apologize if i worried you . 
my god .  .  .  what has happened ? 
what is so urgent ? 
i have been reading your journal .  i &apos;m sorry .   i found it too fascinating to resist .   i rode to catch up with you at the notary ,  out of curiosity .   before i found you though ,  i overheard what you were said . 
the church . 
you said yourself .   what mere man could have downed the belltower ? 
here .  .  .  in front of this oak ,  facing north .   horrible .  .  . 
he rides tonight . 
go home . 
there was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss ,  one old boy from california and one old boy from arkansas .  old boy from california says ,   &quot; boy this water &apos;s cold .  &quot;  old boy from arkansas says  &quot; yeah ,  and it &apos;s deep too .  &quot;   get it ?  that &apos;s a goodun . 
i don &apos;t reckon . 
thank ye . 
doin &apos; pretty good .  got a sick tiller here .  what &apos;s got you down this way ? 
i bet you did .  i was never bent that way .  i &apos;m bent the other way .  so ,  you liked it out there in the world . 
well ,  it &apos;s not too big in here ,  is it ?   i feel very generous today .  i feel like listening .  i &apos;m sure you have plenty to tell me .  and please bore me with the details .   ) come on karl ,  who did you kill ?  was it the boy ? 
hey freddy ,  what &apos;s goin &apos; on boy .  i seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin &apos; that big - ass bass . 
okay ladies and gentlemen  or both .  it &apos;s come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band .  over here on lead guitar mr .  randy horsefeathers .  come on hit a hot lick ,  randy .   well ,  come on ,  y &apos;all are supposed to clap now .  come on !

i ain &apos;t sure . 
i don &apos;t really understand the meaning of the words . 
we don &apos;t have a goddamn band !  y &apos;all just shut the fuck up !  we don &apos;t need no practicin &apos; or managers cause we ain &apos;t no fuckin &apos; band !  morris ain &apos;t no genius and the rest of you are just losers .  am i the only one sane human bein &apos; around here ?  just get the hell out of my house and don &apos;t come back ! 
what &apos;s all them books ? 
why &apos;d you live there ? 
wait a minute .  you want to go with me ?  you can meet my mama . 
they still around ,  your folks ? 
i &apos;ve had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died .  sometimes i wish i was still real little and he was still here .  my mama &apos;s real good ,  but i wish i had both of  &apos;em .   when we went to memphis one time in the car ,  it was rainin &apos; so hard we couldn &apos;t see the road .  but i wadn &apos;t scared because i thought as long as daddy was drivin &apos; nothin &apos; could happen to us .  i feel that way about mama now .   mama has a boyfriend now .  his name is doyle hargraves .  he works construction so he makes a pretty good livin &apos; .  he still don &apos;t help mama out with any money though .  he ain &apos;t no good .  he &apos;s mean to her .  he don &apos;t like me at all .  mama says it &apos;s because he &apos;s jealous i belong to my daddy instead of him .  he stays with us all night sometimes ,  but he &apos;s got his own house .  somebody told me it &apos;s so he can still have other girlfriends .  i like it on the nights when he ain &apos;t at our house .  i &apos;m not so nervous then . 
karl .   you know when i said daddy got hit by a train . 
it ain &apos;t the truth .  he shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose . 
i &apos;d like to kill that son of a bitch .  i hate him . 
i was goin &apos; to the secret place .  i borried one of your books to take down there .  you ain &apos;t mad ,  are you ? 
just  &apos;cause i &apos;m not rich don &apos;t mean i don &apos;t love her . 
you threw it in a trash barrel ? 
what you readin &apos; ? 
bill cox is goin &apos; to a funeral for a mister turner tomorrow and a closin &apos; up shop early . 
karl ,  i ain &apos;t tryin &apos; to say nothin &apos; bad about you ,  but why don &apos;t you stop doyle when he gets that away ?  you &apos;re older than him .  you &apos;re strong ,  too .  my daddy wouldn &apos;t let him do that to me and mama . 
how come karl won &apos;t eat here with us ? 
i know honey .  just remember what i said ,  we &apos;ll bide our time .  you just steer clear of him as much as you can .  doyle &apos;s had a real hard life .  it &apos;s just about run him crazy i think . 
no ,  i mean your past .  about why you were in here .   i &apos;ll take you first thing in the mornin &apos; .  you have anyplace you can stay tonight at all ?  i just can &apos;t let you stay here .  it &apos;s the rules .  if something happened well ,  i &apos;d be liable . 
karl ,  you up ? 
yeah . 
yes ma &apos;am . 
i wouldn &apos;t mind a havin &apos; supper . 
karl ,  what are you doing here ?  come in . 
well ,  sure ,  okay .  he hasn &apos;t hurt them ,  has he ? 
what about you ,  karl ?  do you want to stay here ? 
he just got out of the state hospital . 
are you sure it &apos;s safe to let him around that guy ? 
karl ,  maybe you and melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner .  it &apos;s a nice night . 
hey ,  you &apos;re the one that wanted to major in journalism .  anyhow ,  wasn &apos;t the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it ,  it was twenty - five years ago ,  he probably doesn &apos;t even remember it . 
i thought you &apos;d be happy to leave . 
karl &apos;s real sensitive about having his picture made .  he wouldn &apos;t even be on the bulletin board for the easter collage .   melvin ,  would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes ?  you girls want some coffee ? 
he &apos;s free .  his time &apos;s up .  that &apos;s the rules .  he &apos;s been treated and reevaluated .  he doesn &apos;t show any signs any more . 
where will he go ? 
jesus ,  what happened to you ? 
are you closed ? 
how &apos;d you get started ? 
i &apos;d like to see your pictures some day . 
but they &apos;re all the same . 
yeah .  there she is .  she &apos;s in quite a few from that year .  she must have been on her way to work . 
hey ,  auggie ,  i &apos;ve just been thinking .  you wouldn &apos;t need some help around the store ,  would you ?  some summer help while vinnie &apos;s gone ? 
i &apos;m thinking about the kid .  i &apos;m sure he &apos;d do a good job for you . 
it &apos;s written all over you like a neon sign .  now say something nice to rashid to make him feel better . 
nice machine ,  auggie .  where &apos;d you find it ? 
hey ,  man ,  how &apos;s it going ? 
yeah ,  great .  the problem is ,  i have four days to come up with something ,  and i don &apos;t have a single idea .   you know anything about christmas stories ? 
every word . 
is that all ?  i thought it was about three hundred . 
help ,  huh ?  and i don &apos;t suppose this help has anything to do with money ,  does it ? 
our daughter ?  is that what you said ?  our daughter ?  i mean ,  you might have a daughter ,  but i sure as hell don &apos;t .  and even if i did  -  -  which i don &apos;t  -  -  she wouldn &apos;t be our daughter . 
you &apos;ve suckered me before ,  darling ,  remember ?  why should i believe you now ? 
that &apos;s what you told me when i shoplifted that necklace for you .  you remember ,  baby ,  don &apos;t you ?  the judge gave me a choice :  either go to the can or enlist .  so ,  instead of going to college ,  i wind up in the navy for four years ,  i watch men lose their arms and legs ,  i nearly get my head blown off ,  and you ,  sweet ruby mcnutt ,  you run off and marry that asshole ,  bill . 
fifteen years ago ?   it won &apos;t wash ,  pumpkin .  no mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he &apos;s a father .  i wasn &apos;t born yesterday ,  you know . 
nice try ,  old girl .  i &apos;d like to help you out .  you know ,  for old time &apos;s sake .  but all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture ,  and i haven &apos;t collected my profits yet .  too bad .  you caught me at the wrong time . 
get in ,  auggie .  i &apos;ve got something to show you . 
jesus christ .  this is all i need . 
it &apos;s pretty crazy ,  don &apos;t you think ?  i mean ,  a smart guy like you .  what do you want to hang on to a dead - end job like this for ? 
you don &apos;t take anything seriously ,  do you ? 
no ,  it &apos;s five thousand dollars . 
so i can get my job back . 
to look at the dirty magazines .  i can see all the naked women i want ,  and it doesn &apos;t cost me a cent . 
does it hurt ? 
he &apos;s in trouble ,  all right .  but i don &apos;t have any idea what it is . 
it &apos;s rundown ,  all right .  but drawing a picture won &apos;t improve the way it looks .   let &apos;s see what you did ,  rembrandt . 
five bucks !  you mean you &apos;re going to charge me five bucks just to look at it ? 
do you have eyes in your head ,  or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles ?  you &apos;ve been sitting here all day ,  and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas ? 
not a one .  not one customer all day .  i bought this broken - down shit - hole of a place three weeks ago ,  and if business don &apos;t pick up soon ,  i &apos;m going straight down the skids .  what do i want to be hiring someone for ?  i can &apos;t even pay my own wages . 
five bucks an hour .  that &apos;s the going rate ,  isn &apos;t it ?   it &apos;s a quarter past two now .  my wife &apos;s picking me up at five - thirty ,  so that &apos;ll give you about three hours .  if you can &apos;t finish today ,  you can do the rest tomorrow . 
you named the kid after yourself ,  huh ? 
well ? 
i don &apos;t know .  hello ,  mom .  hello ,  dad .  something like that . 
so what &apos;s the time ? 
watch out ,  man .  you &apos;ll get yourself killed like that . 
it &apos;s okay ,  mister .  no big deal . 
you must eat lunch pretty early .  it &apos;s only eleven o &apos;clock . 
yeah ,  sure ,  and i bet you had lobster last night .  along with two bottles of champagne . 
mostly what . 
the material world is an illusion .  it doesn &apos;t matter if they &apos;re there or not .  the world is in my head . 
i didn &apos;t expect to see you again . 
i listen on the radio .  i can see the games just fine that way .   the world is in your head ,  remember ? 
is that what you do ?  draw pictures ? 
where the hell do you think you &apos;re going ? 
it might not be far ,  but it &apos;s another galaxy .  black is black and white is white ,  and never the twain shall meet . 
let &apos;s not get too idealistic . 
all right .  listen carefully .   about twenty - five years ago ,  a young man went skiing alone in the alps .  there was an avalanche ,  the snow swallowed him up ,  and his body was never recovered . 
hey ,  hey .  happy birthday .  why didn &apos;t you tell me ? 
uh ,  actually ,  i tend to shy away from that kind of thing . 
it &apos;s 1942 ,  right ?  and he &apos;s caught in leningrad during the siege .  i &apos;m talking about one of the worst moments in human history .  five hundred thousand people died in that one place ,  and there &apos;s bakhtin ,  holed up in an apartment ,  expecting to be killed any day .  he has plenty of tobacco ,  but no paper to roll it in .  so he takes the pages of a manuscript he &apos;s been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes . 
so you &apos;re saying it wasn &apos;t like that at all . 
$1200 an acre ,  that &apos;s what i paid ole ,  won &apos;t take a dime less .   you got no choice on that . 
but you can &apos;t say with any certainty that the blood was his . 
and the blood could not< / u> have belonged to defendant .   seeing that his type is o negative . 
now the sheriff believed that the d - 6 battery in carl &apos;s well was carl &apos;s own spare .   even though it was too large f .  .  . 
trials aren &apos;t only about truth ,  mr .  hooks .   even though they should be .   they &apos;re about what people believe< / u> is true . 
we were afraid .   silence seemed better .   to come forward seemed like a mistake . 
doesn &apos;t it seem to you< / u> ,  mrs .  miyamoto ,  that your mistake was in being deceitful ?   concealing information during the course of a sheriff &apos;s investigation . 
and your evaluation of the defendant ?   could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff ?  so quickly ,  there would be no sign of struggle ? 
i asked you a question ,  you &apos;re writing a tract ,  h .  .  . 
my apologies .   do you regret not telling the truth ? 
didn &apos;t go anywhere else ?   no errands ,  no purchases ?   just straight to the boat .   that &apos;s the truth . 
well ,  the sheriff found two< / u> batteries in your well .   if you left one with carl heine ,  how is that possible ? 
you have the night watch ?   on the radio . 
how long you have this detail ? 
you mean ,  early morning the 16th ? 
they got transferred that day .  out to cape flattery . 
here now ,  what are you fixin &apos; to do ? 
this tastes horrible ,  hmmn ? 
he &apos;s looking down .   and he &apos;s not thinking  &apos;bout the man you were yesterday .   he &apos;s proud of the man you are tonight .   that &apos;s what counts . 
then where &apos;s the lantern ?   and where &apos;s the knife ? 
what for ,  sheriff ? 
sheriff ,  i can &apos;t afford not to fish toni .  .  . 
and what &apos;s that ? 
you want me to say that . 
operating this winch you &apos;d rarely operated before ,  doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds .  .  . is it possible< / u> .   possible that he struck his head after< / u> death .  possible ? 
and her farmhouse .  .  .  ? 
 .  .  . he used to say ,   &quot; if it ain &apos;t broke ,  don &apos;t fix it .  &quot; 
are these your bags ? 
listen ,  doll  -  what time do you get off tonight ? 
hi ,  mary lou  -  rosella  -  okay ,  dolores ,  get a move on  -  how &apos;s your back ,  olga ? 
yes ,  sue ?   what is it ? 
i beg your pardon . 
same faces  -  same instruments  -    -  and here &apos;s your valentine &apos;s card . 
what are you giving me with the rabbit ? 
but suppose it doesn &apos;t ? 
suppose mary pickford divorces douglas fairbanks ? 
well ,  that solves one problem .   we don &apos;t have to worry about who to pay first .

men ? 
steady ,  boy .   just keep telling yourself you &apos;re a girl . 
they don &apos;t care  -  just as long as you wear skirts .   it &apos;s like waving a red flat in front of a bull . 
wise guy ,  huh ?   trying to louse me up  - 
and where &apos;s he going to be ? 
because we &apos;re pals  -  buddies  -  the two musketeers .

shiteater - 
ma &apos;am ,  we &apos;re tracking a resistance .  .  .  it &apos;s probably canadian spies !  ! 
i am the dark master ! 
yes .  .  .  and in doing so ,  you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming . 
say phillip ,  want to see the northern lights ? 
saddam ,  would you let me do my job please ! 
well of course he wants out of hell !  the whole point of hell is that you don &apos;t want to be here ! 
it has come to be .  .  .   the four horsemen are drawing nigh !   the time of the prophecy is upon us ! 
now do what i say and keep your fucking mouth shut ! 
didn &apos;t you think it was funny ,  wendy ? 
nazis !  ! 
wendy .  .  .  how would you like to go get some ice cream ? 
<b>thank my lucky stars here before me now is everything i &apos;d ever hoped for - < / b>

koros ,  as in .  .  . koros ?   dimitri koros ? 
mac ,  you really earned your wings this flight . 
what did you say to me ? 
all too well ,  captain . 
yes i &apos;m sure i hit the right commands . 
you &apos;re certain of that ? 
you gotta think of your old age . 
i think i can handle it . 
if anyone can hear me please respond ! 
uh ,  that &apos;s an affirmative ,  roger wilco .   please proceed . 
that was a joke taylor ,  lighten up !   why don &apos;t you just hold them up to the lens .   i &apos;ll write them down ,  and once i &apos;m through verifying them ,  i &apos;ll get back to you . 
well don &apos;t drag your ass .   there won &apos;t be much of a window for us to link up .   we &apos;ll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours . 
will do .   what about the distress signal ? 
well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation ? 
what &apos;s the use .  .  . we &apos;re gonna die .  .  . 
well i don &apos;t think there &apos;s a chance of that happening .   it &apos;s usually the moon walks .   sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher . 
really ? 
supposing we could get out of this room ?   is there anything we could do to reach the bridge ? 
damn it .   if only we could get to those suits .  .  .  dawn then thinks of something  - 
and suppose you couldn &apos;t hold out ? 
you &apos;re ready for the real thing ? 
dawn !   dawn ! 
dawn .   come in . 
what do you mean ?   what happened ! 
no ,  just enjoying the view . 
what is happening around here !  !  ! 
again with the orders from you !  you got a napoleon complex chief ,  and i &apos;m getting sick of it ! 
mac ,  i have a favor to ask you .  mac looks at taylor  - 
yes i know all that .   mac ,  i need you to help us out with a little technical problem . 
i &apos;m an addict .  i can &apos;t go through a day without the stuff .  theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand . 
you a mini - golfer ? 
how do you know ,  you don &apos;t even speak latin ? 
you got an 8 - track tape player on purpose ,  just  &apos;cause you knew the only thing they had on 8 - track was fuckin &apos; opera . 
you know ,  elvis bowled . 
sure ,  sid . 
bowling police ,  step back ,  give him room . 
you look like you &apos;re something on the lanes . 
it &apos;s a beautiful thing . 
who gave it to you ? 
i don &apos;t know no grace skinner . 
theo ,  i want you to get out of this town . 
thanks ,  kid .   where are you goin &apos; now ? 
you give ed klein of the american bowling congress a call .   tell him your maynard &apos;s boy .  he &apos;s expecting you ,  and he owes me .  he &apos;ll getcha back in like flynn .   don &apos;t say i never gave you nothing . 
son ? 
theo .  howzitgoin . 
uh .  .  . over easy . 
who &apos;s there ! 
no ,  junior ,  you shouldn &apos;t touch her . 
come on ,  junior .  everyone &apos;s waiting for you ,  son .  the beam of light catches junior &apos;s face .  he is crouched inside the machine at lane six .  jr .  his face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy . 
someone gonna get kacked ,  boss ? 
what &apos;s with the bad air between you two ,  mr .  kastle ? 
that &apos;s some pinfall .  almost a 133 average .  her ball &apos;s flat ,  she needs to work on her spin control . 
there &apos;s a lot of competition for amusement out there .  you gotta adapt to survive . 
where &apos;s junior ? 
you &apos;re just like you mother !  always jealous ! 
fantastic !  what talent . 
don &apos;t go near the bowling alley . 
what &apos;s your specialty ? 
here theo ,  it &apos;s the fazeli specialty; a seven - ten split .  theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing . 
isn &apos;t this technically a scooter ? 
whoa . 
mind if i cut in ? 
i wanted to be a motocross champion .  my folks didn &apos;t really care what i did .  then junior blew a fuse and i became their last hope .  most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats ,  i got bowling .  i never understood how anyone could take it so seriously .  i hope i &apos;m not insulting you . 
and besides ,  it &apos;s probably too late ,  anyhow . 
no ,  but something &apos;s gonna blow in this town .  i can feel it . 
why did you come back ? 
if junior finds us ,  he &apos;ll kill us both . 
theo ,  buzz is dead . 
what makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum ?  huh ? 
you think i &apos;m dumping you to get back into bowling .  well who &apos;s dumping who ? 
aagh !  stop !  those are my bowling fingers ! 
you should probably hit the road .  go home .  this place could get hazardous for your health . 
they &apos;re warm .   i can feel the heat on my legs . 
how big is this spacecraft ? 
nobody move . 
we &apos;re a habitat .   not a castle .   the only defense we have is high voltage . 
thank you ,  colonel . 
well ,  thanks for the opportuninty here  -  -  my wife appreciates it . 
the one you recommended .   in the ulf report you wrote for the bush administration . 
like  &quot; thou shall not kill &quot;  ? 
don &apos;t get hysterical ,  norman . 
a while back ,  beth and i  -  -  we worked at the same university .   she was assisting a chemist there  -  -  i forget his name  -  -  doing research ,  experiments .   she was also living with him .   yeah ,  i know .   and when she finished her work ,  he kicked her out ,  broke off the relationship ,  and published five papers  -  -  all her work  -  -  without any thank you or acknowledgement . 
edmunds ? 
what for ? 
i don &apos;t want you talking to jerry . 
yes ,  sir .   i &apos;m here . 
we don &apos;t have anything else to try ,  sir . 
how much damage ? 
i did . 
ignorant .   the thing &apos;s ignorant . 
a half a mile long ? 
captain ,  you know ,  i really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television . 
can i stay ,  sir ?   i &apos;m willing to risk it .   i am .   after what we just witnessed . 
did you hear me ,  sir ,  because  -  - 
she says jellyfish are a delicacy .  you know ,  i never knew that . 
to the spacecraft .   to investigate . 
well ,  you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here .   in the ocean .   70 percent of the earth &apos;s surface is water ,  norman .   that &apos;s first grade geography . 
well ,  let &apos;s pray that &apos;s the only mistake you made .   have you said anything to barnes about this ? 
isn &apos;t there a psychological term for that ,  dr .  johnson ? 
where &apos;d this come from ? 
we have a library ? 
what ?  .  .  .   wait .   don &apos;t .  .  .  why are you  -  - 
so who was barnes talking to at the last minute ?   nobody . 
don &apos;t tell me to calm down ! 
four days ? 
wait a second  -  - 
he translated it wrong . 
i &apos;m sorry . 
you don &apos;t think i put something in it ,  do you ? 
are you manifesting them ? 
beth you &apos;re losing it .   c &apos;mon . 
you &apos;re lying  -  - 
it &apos;s your choice .   because it &apos;s not safe for you to be awake .   to be walking around .   to be thinking about things . 
where is it coming from ,  beth ? 
would it work ? 
i don &apos;t get it . 
norman ?   where &apos;s norman ? 
for who ?   the fish ? 
i &apos;m sorry .   slip of the tongue . 
our habitat ,  i mean .   this place can &apos;t handle another attack . 
is it coming from our own computer ? 
i mentioned it in my report .   didn &apos;t you read the report ? 
so ,  we know< / u> .   we know it went through a black hole .   we saw it .   norman  -  -  when we &apos;d get to the surface ,  we &apos;d tell someone about the black hole ,  wouldn &apos;t we ?   it &apos;d go in some report like some big discovery .   so in fifty years when they build that ship ,  they &apos;d make precautions for a black hole .   but they didn &apos;t< / u> .   the called it an unknown entry event . 
no .   i didn &apos;t say that . 
it &apos;s what &apos;s in that sphere ,  isn &apos;t it ,  harry ?   whatever you think is in that thing  -  -  you think it &apos;s going to kill you . 
tell me about the door .   do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere ?  .  .  .  harry ? 
these aren &apos;t half bad ,  fletcher .   you might have a second career coming . 
have you looked outside ?   jellyfish .  everywhere .   i hate jellyfish .   harry ,  what happened in the cafeteria ? 
what do you mean ?   she &apos;s not here ? 
navy transmission .   they &apos;re sent from wisconsin . 
we just figured ,  you know ,  the three of us  -  -  we need to .  .  .  work together through this . 
that &apos;s right . 
it &apos;s the squid !   stop it ! 
i can &apos;t reach her . 
push her ,  c &apos;mon . 
you know how to work this thing ? 
less than a minute ,  we &apos;re never gonna make it . 
how &apos;s that working out ,  by the way ? 
what does norman already know ? 
we take a weeny little wedge ,  bang on it a couple of times ,  and bust off a chunk of the metal .   yet any spacecraft  -  -  even at a low velocity ,  say 200 miles an hour  -  -  crashes into the water  -  -  it &apos;s gonna be like hitting concrete ,  it would crumple like paper .   but there isn &apos;t a dent to be seen anywhere .   not even a scratch . 
what report ? 
frankly ,  ted ,  i &apos;d be much happier if jerry was just a cold ,  emotionless intellect . 
in the closet .   i don &apos;t understand ,  norman  -  -  why would they call you ? 
well ,  i can &apos;t imagine five years of unemployment  -  - 
well ,  we &apos;ll see .  .  . 
we &apos;re going to get in by studying imperial procedures ?   i don &apos;t like it . 
i &apos;ll get the information . 
i &apos;m luke starkiller ,  guardian of the bendu . 
you &apos;re general kenobi ?  !  ?   the jedi knight !   the commander of the white legions ? 
you saw through me ? 
i assure you my intentions weren &apos;t bad . 
it surrounds you and radiates from you .   a jedi can feel it flowing from him .  .  .    .  .  .  from here ! 
a jedi &apos;s power is measured by the amount of the force that is stored within him ,  and i have little of the force left in me . 
yes .   it was a black day .   one of my disciple &apos;s took the crystal and became a sith lord .   it was a black day .   the few crystals that remain are in the possession of the sith lords on alderaan .   that &apos;s how they &apos;ve become so powerful . 
but she &apos;s a member of the twelve families .   how can they hold her ? 
of course ,  where you been kid ? 
as close as we can make out ,  it appears to be a corellian gypsy vessel .  .  .  it &apos;s not under power . 
put that thing away or you &apos;re going to get us all killed . 
you got yourself a ship .   we can leave as soon as you &apos;re ready . 
i found it .  .  .  it &apos;s just not there . 
you can &apos;t !   we &apos;ve come this far .   we must find them .  .  . 
it &apos;s only light that doesn &apos;t affect it .   solid things ,  like rocks ,  can hurt it !   fire above him ! 
i don &apos;t pick up any life form concentration down there .   she &apos;d better be right . 
no need ,  everything &apos;s under control . 
i am luke starkiller at your service . 
level five ,  detention block a - 23 ,  cell 2187 .   she &apos;s still alive .  .  . 
are you rated to repair a marauder power suit ,  rico  ? 
sir ,  i wish to reconsider my request to drop out ,  sir . 
don &apos;t think about it .  .  .  go on instinct . 
statistically speaking you should &apos;ve accidentally guessed right by know . 
i don &apos;t believe it  ! 
so what are you doing later  ? 
i &apos;m all ears . 
johnny ,  this is zander . 
everything coposetic ,  lieutenant  ? 
no ,  i .  .  .  oh ,  zander ,  i &apos;m a fool . 
where are you going  ? 
how do you feel about him now  ? 
i thought i was dead .  lucky for me you jokers showed up ,  eh  ? 
well ,  if that &apos;s the crop ,  that must be the gastric caecal .  .  . 
zander is going for pilot ,  too . 
everyone &apos;s looking .  .  .  we shouldn &apos;t .  .  . 
you &apos;re late . 
do you mean it  ? 
it &apos;s funny .  sometimes i forget .  then it hits me ,  and i can &apos;t stop crying . 
you look so .  .  .  i don &apos;t know ,  you look like you &apos;ve really been in it . 
this is rodger young ,  we &apos;re going down .  .  .  repeat ,  this is rodger young ,  we &apos;re going down .  .  .  ! 
steady as she goes ,  number one .  prepare for warp .  number two ,  design for jupiter orbit . 
report . 
where &apos;d it come from  ? 
man ,  they &apos;re defended .  .  .  no way in . 
what  ? 
planet p  ?  what kind of name is that  ? 
well ,  it &apos;s just good to hear from you .  what &apos;s up ,  son  ? 
you knew the lieutenant before the war .  .  .  what was he like  ? 
are your parents currently citizens  ? 
mister rasczak  ? 
i just wanted to say thanks  &apos;cause history and moral philosophy was the best class i had this year . 
i wanna join up ,  mr .  rasczak .  i think i have what it take to be a citizen . 
yopu asked me some advice once ,  rico .  want some now  ? 
who is .  .  .  &apos;v &apos;ger &apos; .  .  .  ? 
and when v &apos;ger melds ?  what will happen to you ? 
i trust you will .  .  .  nursemaid me through these difficulties ,  mister ? 
i advise caution ,  captain; we can &apos;t withstand another attack . 
that &apos;s precisely the point ,  captain .  we don &apos;t know it will do .  moving into the cloud  -  -  at this time ,  is an unwarranted gamble . 
captain ,  what &apos;s the next move ? 
mr .  decker .  .  .  i will contact you every five minutes .  otherwise .  .  .  inform mr .  scott immediately . 
the fault is here ,  sir ,  not in the transmission .   the antenna leads have been disconnected .  v &apos;ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal . 
exactly .   and you did have a  &apos;relationship &apos; with lieutenant ilia ,  commander . 
forward motion ,  captain .  .  .  ! 
mr .  spock ,  what would v &apos;ger need to fulfill itself ? 
hello ,  ilia . 
was he difficult ? 
five minutes to cloud boundary ! 
mr .  sulu ,  steady as she goes . 
hold station .  .  .  ! 
clear the bridge ,  captain .  .  .  ? 
admiral ,  i &apos;ve been hoping to see you .  maybe you can get through to those thick heads in starfleet that .  .  . 
we &apos;re hoping it &apos;s only a temporary problem ,  admiral .  .  . 
also  -  -  there was nothing in your report about why< / u> you &apos;re here . 
recommend we proceede ,  captain . 
they had a pattern to follow .  .  . 
spock ?  concerned about his chances ? 
not for us ? 
evening ,  annie . 
then you &apos;ll be wet . 
mom &apos;s expecting you for dinner tonight . 
you bringing your new friend ? 
other one has history ,  too .   i wrote my play on it . 
you like my play .

planning on getting  -  - 
i &apos;ve been with someone for quite some time ,  and didn &apos;t feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly .   but after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her  -  -  and the kids i might add  -  -  she moved in last month . 
rachel &apos;s not half my age . 
you ask me that counselor &apos;s making a mountain out of a molehill .  .  . 
jackie ,  you &apos;ve made mistakes  -  -  we all make mistakes  -  - 
you &apos;re saying ,  don &apos;t make the kids a football ,  don &apos;t put them through a war .   but i &apos;m doing this for their< / u> well - being . 
you know the kids aren &apos;t really in danger .   this is about rachel ,  and you &apos;re right ,  i &apos;m disappointed in her learning curve ,  and .  .  . 
i &apos;m afraid she &apos;s going to walk . 
it &apos;s a huge moment in their life  -  - 
i had a lot of treatments ,  and they weren &apos;t any fun ,  but the tests show the cancer got smaller .

you taught my child that i am some limp dick loser< / u> .   who didn &apos;t care< / u> about her pain . 
you think i< / u> didn &apos;t have some dirty words for that little putz ?   you think i< / u> couldn &apos;t figure out some low blows ? 
and there will come another< / u> moment .  when the stakes are really< / u> there .  and she will look back on this .   and remember how good it felt .   how easy it was . 
ben never mentioned it . 
you know ,  there &apos;s nothing you have to say .   because they know your heart .   you don &apos;t have t .  .  .

you understand that they &apos;re watching our every move right now -  - you think you &apos;re just going to sail away ? 
you see ,  it paid off -  - you broke away from the old guard ,  congresswoman .   it won &apos;t be long till they &apos;re calling you senator filmore -  - 
our traveler &apos;s insurance ,  you know what i mean ?

operator .  .  . how much would the call be station - to - station ?  .  .  . thirty - five cents cheaper ?  .  .  . i &apos;d still be short twenty cents  .  .  . just a second ,  operator .  .  .   colonel ,  shoot the lock off the coke machine .   there &apos;s bound to be enough change in there . 
i didn &apos;t say anything .   what &apos;s the meaning of disturbing me at this hour ,  colonel ? 
what do you suppose is going to happen if general ripper &apos;s planes start bombing their targets ? 
combat operations center ,  major mandrake speaking . 
all right ,  major .   i &apos;m putting the base on condition red . 
are you trying to be insubordinate ? 
are you questioning my orders ,  major ? 
you &apos;re a good officer ,  major ,  and you &apos;re perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention . 
but then ,  sir ,  why have you issued the order :  wing attack ,  plan - r ? 
suppose that were the case ? 
what shall we drink to ,  sir ? 
general ripper ,  can i ask another question ? 
i don &apos;t think so ,  sir . 
i see .

yes ,  sir .   the base commander ,  general ripper ,  selected plan - r ? 
general jack d .  ripper ,  sir . 
general schmuck ,  are you positive of your figures ? 
yes ? 
you &apos;ve lied to me twice  -  i &apos;m sorry ,  but it will be strictly routine .   these men are experts . 
i &apos;ve got the heading ,  major .   one - three - eight . 
we should be crossing the coast in about six minutes . 
he &apos;s right .   they must have clobbered some of our cities already . 
missiles !   sixty miles off ,  heading in fast .   steady track ,  they look like beam riders . 
why can &apos;t he help me now ?   he &apos;s sitting two feet away from me ! 
look ,  i &apos;m shot  -  it hurts . 
they can &apos;t touch us at this height .

i thought i should check out the damage first .  my gear is busted up pretty bad . 
gee ,  we hate to leave you like this ,  major kong .   but there isn &apos;t anything we can really accomplish by sticking around . 
what &apos;s your point ,  lothar ? 
check target approach . 
check ,  all bomb circuits green .   okay ,  lothar . 
second safety . 
they must have gotten it from the base .  no one else would know it . 
lieutenant zogg ,  what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission ? 
lieutentant zogg ,  how would you like your black butt slung into a general court martial when we get back ?  ?  ? 
first lesson in war college :   never under -  estimate your enemy . 
when they emerge ,  a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable ,  if they are moth - balled in advance .   i would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years .

 .  .  . so although their dad said ,   &quot; don &apos;t get out of the car until i get back with help ,  &quot;  they knew the sheriff &apos;s voice as he yelled .    &quot; run to my voice  -  and don &apos;t look back .  &quot;   the twins did as he said ,  but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient ,  bouncing their father &apos;s head on the top of the car !   ah !   they jumped ,  diane !   they jumped !

you sure have . 
what about all those ideas you had ? 
and don &apos;t make it too dreary .   how about this for a situation :  she teaches daytimes .   he teaches at night .   right ?   they don &apos;t even know each other ,  but they share the same room .   it &apos;s cheaper that way .   as a matter of fact ,  they sleep in the same bed  -  -  in shifts ,  of oourse . 
why not ? 
what happened ? 
her own movie theatre . 
yes ,  i did . 
what &apos;s the matter ,  norma ? 
they &apos;re dead .   they &apos;re finished .  there was a time when this busi -  ness had the eyes of the whole wide world .   but that wasn &apos;t good enough .   oh ,  nol they wanted the ears of the world ,  too .   so they opened their big mouths ,  and out came talk ,  talk ,  talk .  .  . 
you &apos;re a writer ,  you said . 
who else  ? 
who ?   i &apos;d have to have somebody i can trust .   when were you born  -  -  i mean ,  what sign of the zodiac ? 
maybe i &apos;d better take the rest of the script home and read it  - 
hollywood .   the alto nido apart -  ments . 
what &apos;s that ? 
i want to talk to you for a minute .

of course not ,  joe .   it &apos;s just that i don &apos;t want to be left alone .  not now ,  while i &apos;m under this terrible strain .   my nerves are being torn apart .   all i ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind . 
you are not dressed properly . 
she was the greatest .   you wouldn &apos;t know .   you are too young .   in one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters .   men would bribe her mani -  curist to get clippings from her fingernails .   there was a maharajah who came all the way from hyderabad to get one of her stockings .   later ,  he strangled himself with it . 
is that so ! 
how come ? 
how about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark .  will that do it ? 
oh ,  you &apos;re one of the message kids .   just a story won &apos;t do .  you &apos;d have turned down gone with the wind . 
so you need three hundred dollars ?  of course ,  i could give you three hundred dollars .   only i &apos;m not going to . 
was it a sudden quarrel ?   had there been any trouble between you before ? 
oh ,  fiddlesticks .  what could be dangerous about a baseball game ? 
bianca ,  try not to be so bloodthirsty when you &apos;re at the wheel .  ok ?

nigel ,  get lost . 
the danvers .  and two of your little friends . 
you &apos;ve run out of things to throw ,  selena .

it &apos;s dangerous to use a power source on earth .  it can unleash all sorts of terrible forces -  -  - 
others ? 
then teach me how . 
here i am ,  honey ,  and i &apos;m all yours .   remember when you were queen of the prom ?  all the guys had to wait in line to get a dance .   but now there &apos;s only one name on your dance card ,  sweet thing ,  and it &apos;s  -  - 
i just think ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids . 
i can never get a way from it . 
he really was ! 
gee ,  i always loved porch swings . 
mr .  white ,  please ,  i promised those people i &apos;d get back to them by this morning .  what do you think ? 
do you really know superman ? 
hi .  mister kent .   guess who mom &apos;s having dinner with tonight ?  superman ! 
name ? 
how many sugars ? 
gus ? 
gus ,  do you know what i want now ?  i want coffee ! 
what ? 
that &apos;s what i been thinkin &apos; about .  how you been keepin &apos; me .   i ain &apos;t getting &apos; nothing outta this gig . 
he sure wasn &apos;t actin &apos; bad and nasty that day in smallville .  man ,  he was so full of niceness i was startin &apos; to feel funny about layin &apos; that chunk of .  .  . 
now .  .  . when do i get a taste ? 
a waste - basket ?  gus those are plans .   blueprints . 
a computer . 
i told you it wasn &apos;t no jive . 
but a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies .  people who will want to destroy it . 
that &apos;s up to the judge ,  gus .  it &apos;s not your problem anymore . 
no ,  we &apos;re just going down . 
i never crash ,  gus .  that &apos;d be embarrassing . 
you know ,  i really wasn &apos;t expecting all this . 
the picture looks blurry . 
hey ,  i &apos;d definitely shoot color on that one ,  jimmy .  it &apos;d be a crime to just use black and white . 
i don &apos;t know you ,  lady . 
53 . 
mr .  white ,  the next number ,  please ? 
it &apos;s modern .  it &apos;s up - to - date .  it &apos;s state - of - the art .   people ,  i am in love with this machine .   go ahead ,  mr .  white . 
she &apos;s not his mama either . 
he ruined it !  that lousy do - gooder ,  he ruined it . 
don &apos;t you see ?  okay ,  so you didn &apos;t kill him .  nobody &apos;s perfect .  but that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn &apos;t a complete failure after all .   right after gus gave it to him ,  superman started to turn into a selfish ,  ornery ,  malicious ,  conniving .  .  . 
he &apos;s coming !  he &apos;s going to hurt me ! 
lois ,  i usually do . 
lois ,  why don &apos;t you at least get one of those automatic ones ? 
 &apos;magic fingers .  &apos; fifty cents . 
i mean it strikes me funny that every time superman comes around ,  you disappear . 
don &apos;t  .   .   .  it &apos;s not your fault  .   .   .  you didn &apos;t know  .   .   . 
sleep well ? 
i know ,  i know all the arguments ,  you don &apos;t have to tell me .  that &apos;s what i did all night  -  -  i  &quot; listened to the voices of  reason &quot;  till the dawn came up .  do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you &apos;ve been up night crying ? 
me too ,  oh ,  i tried to convince myself ,  believe me ,   &quot; it &apos;s like being married to a doctor ,  &quot;  i said .  doctors are practically never at home .  the get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it .  then a voice said ,   &quot;  could you be a doctor &apos;s wife ?  or are you too selfish  .   .   .   &quot; 
what ?  ? 
a good time !  is that all you care about ?  ! 
i can &apos;t understand it !  where is he ?  i mean ,  he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree ,  and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act ? 
you no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest .   surely this is not how you repay their gratitude ,  kal - el .  could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream . 
patience ,  kal - el .  you begin to sound like an earthling .  superman mother ,  you speak only of honor ,  of sacrifice ,  of responsibility  -  - 
where ? 
otis ,  your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate .  every man has a vulnerable point .  some like you otis ,  have more that one .  i didn &apos;t see superman &apos;s in time .  but now through patience ,  invention and skill ,  my  black box is just about ready . 
you must be freezing . 
strange .  i tore those metal fibers like paper .  and what he did  .   .   .  .   was amazing !   something is happening  .   .   .  . 
you are master of all you survey . 
he .  .  .   cares .  he actually cares about these  .   .   .   .   .   . these people .  these earth people  . 
general  -  -  -   ? 
you &apos;re late .  very late . 
maybe i should sit this one out . 
it must have been a super effort to get out of bed ,  clark . 
oh  .   .   .  no  .   .   .  i mean ,  we just went  dancing  .   .   .  for  a story  .   .   . 
what &apos;s that ? 
 .   .   .  i look at you ,  lenny ,  and i know how the romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate . 
he missed the door ,  uncle lex . 
gee ,  uncle lex ,  i don &apos;t think this guy &apos;s much of a dancer . 
hey ,  uncle lex ,  how &apos;s the nuclear guy goin &apos; to find his way here ? 
we &apos;ll all fry . 
nice bit .  you &apos;re good .  with my brain and your ,  well ,  frankly ,  brawn ,  the possibilities  are staggering .  i could be  .   .   .  emperor ,  king !  did you see how scared those guys were ? 
me ?  now ?  with superman dead and you on my team ?  it &apos;s like i &apos;m the coach and you &apos;re the best power forward ever .  what could i have to fear ? 
stop !  i command you  .   .   .  you mutant ! 
there &apos;s some slice american cheese .  .  . and .  .  . a half a bottle of club soda ,  i think . 
yes ,  mr .  luthor .  the xk101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected .  it also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it .  it just goes around it or over it .   the xk101 never quits !  it will not stop until it reaches its pre - targeted target ! 
some people aren &apos;t the athletic type . 
see ?  didn &apos;t i tell you this was a tough town ? 
what now ,  my love ? 
he grabbed me !  he held me !  he set me down gently !  how could that be done with mirrors ? 
you !  the girl from the volcano !   kryptonite .  .  . 
it isn &apos;t a park avenue address .  really . 
so i &apos;ve noticed . 
i needed this ,  y &apos;know ?  i really needed this .  just when i &apos;m nearing the fruition of my project ,  big bird flies into town .   go ahead !  kill me by inches !  put me on the agony rack ! 
bet he makes it . 
meteorites ! 
you &apos;re happy ,  aren &apos;t you ? 
weak sister .   i still can &apos;t figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out .  y &apos;know ? 
you got wax in your ears ? 
it &apos;s a  .  .  . baby . 
it &apos;s the only logical conclusion .  if he remains here ,  he &apos;ll be as dead as .  .  . 
i guess i got carried away
the answer is yes .  now what &apos;s the question ? 
oh . 
it must feel great . 
did i do good ,  mr .  luthor ? 
and now he lies to me .  he has been stealing ladies &apos; purses again .   haven &apos;t you ?  haven &apos;t you ,  you miserable petty crook ? 
please .  .  . 
at the san andreas fault .  maybe you &apos;ve heard of it . 
i &apos;m glad to hear that zoe &apos;s okay . 
she &apos;s in trouble ? 
i .  .  . don &apos;t think so . 
goodnight ,  mr .  ansel . 
how is nicole ?   is she around ? 
no ,  billy .   we can &apos;t drop the lawsuit .   you know how much we need the money . 
what time &apos;s he coming home ? 
i stopped by the station a while ago .   i stared at the bus .   i could almost hear the kids inside .   there was a lawyer there .   he told me he &apos;d gotten you signed up .   is that true ? 
billy loved to see his kids in the bus .   they always sat in the back ,  so they could wave to each other .  it comforted him . 
away from your crazy mom . 
from you ? 
can i sit beside you on the bus tomorrow ? 
nicole ? 
that &apos;s right . 
it would be strange if you didn &apos;t feel that way . 
dolores . 
i have no questions . 
when ? 
how old is she ? 
remember that time we were having the car washed and i started playing with the automatic window ?   how old was i ,  daddy ?   five or six ?   i got absolutely soaked ,  remember ? 
yes . 
yes .   give me your news ,  zoe . 
that &apos;s not news ,  zoe . 
i can hear you breathing ,  daddy . 
the walkers spoke very highly of you . 
it should be said that my task is to represent the walkers only in their anger .   not their grief . 
i was scared . 
mrs .   driscoll was driving too fast ?  what made you think that ,  nicole ? 
you believe that the bus driven by mrs .  driscoll was going at seventy -  two miles an hour at this time ? 
you remember this ? 
what &apos;s so funny ? 
what took so long ? 
partly .   but there &apos;s a lot the insurance doesn &apos;t cover .   that &apos;s one of the reasons we have a lawyer .   to make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest . 
nothing good on your t . v .  ? 
she &apos;ll move away . 
that sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town .   he &apos;s about to lose his house and car . 
did she accept ? 
that &apos;s a lollipop that ,  boy .   the kid is only great . 
frank ,  i think maybe you lied to me . 
when do these hot - headed boys of yours go on the road ? 
friends call me otis  -  sometimes tricky otis . 
does he have to be here in our hair ? 
susie ,  as always ,  is free to say anything she thinks .   go on ,  dear ,  say exactly what &apos;s on your mind ,  dear . 
and what have i done to her ,  besides not buy her a new fur coat lately ?   sidney ,  you were right  -  -  the boy &apos;s a dilly . 
why are you trembling ,  dear .  .  .  ? 
let me finish ,  dear .   you had your say ,  now let me have mine .  .  . 
i started to say we &apos;re drifting apart .   a year ago ,  in your wildest dreams ,  would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me ?   today i had to call you in ! 
susie likes to keep her girlish secrets .   but in her heart of hearts i imagine ,  dallas ,  that she fancies you in an uncommon way .  now ,  what about you ,  son ?   not just tom - catting around .  .  . i hope ? 
now ,  come ,  j . j .  ,  that &apos;s a little too harsh .   anyone seems fair game for you tonight . 
can i come out ?   no . 
i know manny davis . 
you told me you &apos;d break up that romance  -  when ? 
frankly ,  j . j .  ,  i don &apos;t think you got the cards to blitz me . 
j . j .  ,  i want you to get them back their job ,  steve and the quintet . 
how ? 
i got that boy coming over here .   what &apos;s so funny ? 
what are you so chipper about ?   if i put a cross on every one of your mistakes ,  you &apos;d look like a graveyard ! 
i know .  .  . i know you &apos;re the strongest cop in town . 
it &apos;s nice ,  sidney ,  that you give me this tip .  .  . 
well ,  i &apos;ll be darned .   and what does j . j .  think he should do ? 
is frank d &apos;angelo around ? 
we &apos;re old friends ,  chickie  -  quit it !   a big columnist comes in this room ,  without his ball - and - chain and you make like a delicatessen counter !   what did you think would happen in his house ? 
don &apos;t you know who that man is ? 
that &apos;s the third time he &apos;s called today . 
but .  .  . 
who else phoned ? 
if that &apos;s for me ,  tear it up ! 
i swear ,  sidney ,  i can &apos;t help it  -  sometimes i wonder what i see in you .  .  . 
yeah !   like me !   i don &apos;t choke on my own gall  -  i fight back !   let them choke ,  not me ! 
listen ,  when your band was playing at roseland  - 
no more you don &apos;t !   what is this  -  you &apos;re showing off for her ?   they &apos;re supposed to hear you in korea ? 
his stooge ,  falco ,  is around  -  i saw him walk in .   he &apos;s been spying on me for weeks ,  susie . 
and on monday ,  i &apos;ll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and  - 
no one &apos;s ever stood up to my brother the way you did . 
like it could disguise itself as anything .  .  .  a pack of cigarettes ? 
everything . 
this is tactically dangerous . 
no ! 
your foster parents are kinda dicks ,  right ? 
so what do you think ,  doctor ?   i &apos;ve shown a lot of improvement ,  haven &apos;t i ? 
this t - 1000 .  .  .  what happens when you shoot it ? 
can it be destroyed ? 
you look like handmade shit . 
the man most directly responsible is miles bennet dyson ,  director of special projects at cyberdyne systems corporation . 
basically .   the skynet funding bill is passed .   the system goes on - line august 4th ,  1997 .   human decisions are removed from strategic defense .   skynet begins to learn ,  at a geometric rate .   it becomes self - aware at 2 : 14 a . m .  eastern time ,  august 29 .  in a panic ,  they try to pull the plug . 
yes .   it launches its icbms against their targets in russia . 
is it safe for them here ? 
where do you stand on all this ? 
on furtwngler . 
and no elbows on the table ! 
lieutenant wills reporting to major arnold .  sir . 
so ,  what does the russki want ? 
major ,  that &apos;s not a good argument .  if dr .  furtwngler did indeed enjoy all these .  .  .  these privileges ,  he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is .  that &apos;s true of any leading artist in any country in the world . 
what ? 
a great artist will have great privileges in a russian zone . 
colonel .  he had no sisters ,  no brothers ,  only a lot of love affairs . 
steve . 
i &apos;m kidding ,  emmi .  what about a record player ?  you have that ,  too ? 
i have been questioned by the gestapo just like that .  just like you questioned him . 
then why did you conduct at one of their nuremberg rallies ? 
how come ? 
when i last saw you ,  i was unprepared .  i did not know what to expect .  in these past weeks ,  i have been thinking more carefully and making some notes .   you have to understand who i am and what i am .  i am a musician and i believe in music .  i am an artist and i believe in art .  art in general ,  and music ,  in particular ,  has for me mystical powers which nurture man &apos;s spiritual needs .  i must confess ,  however ,  to being extremely naive .   i insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics .  my entire life was devoted to music because ,  and this is very important ,  because i thought that i could ,  through music ,  do something practical . 
then you are wrong . 
von der null ? 
i &apos;m sorry . 
stop this ,  please ,  stop this now ! 
okay ,  wilhelm ,  go home now .  go home and think about these past twelve years . 
how can i know such a thing ? 
good ,  and according to your questionnaire ,  helmuth ,  you never joined the nazi party . 
yes ,  you remember . 
and i see what you mean .  you nearly poked my eyes out . 
great catch ,  kid .  the boy runs off . 
do you know who arturo toscanini is ? 
dr .  furtwngler is a great musician .  he actively opposed the nazis and later on he helped many jews to escape . 
i don &apos;t know .   i kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life . 
mmm .   same schedule &apos;s okay . 
do you understand ? 
pay attention .   the 600 series had rubber skin .  we spotted them easy .   but these are new .   they look human .   sweat ,  bad breath ,  everything .   very hard to spot .   i had to wait  &apos;til he moved on you before i could zero him . 
and you &apos;re from the future too ? 
reese .  .  . you got a first name ? 
you &apos;ll learn . 
look .   i found it .   isn &apos;t that it ?   cyber dynamics corporation ? 
reese .   think it through .  we can prevent the war .  nobody else is gonna do it .  if we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again .   we have to so it ourselves . 
let &apos;s go .   time to move out . 
that &apos;s good .   now ,  seven more like that while i make fuses . 
hot dogs ? 
my whole life has been combat . 
not possible . 
it &apos;ll never be over ,  will it ?  look at me ,  i &apos;m shaking .  some legend ,  huh ?   you must be pretty disappointed . 
what are you doing ? 
and who was the enemy ? 
surrounded by living tissue . 
why were the other two women killed ? 
send a unit . 
call her . 
my stock &apos;s falling .   isn &apos;t yours ?  those pennies are costing me millions . 
it probably will .   in fact ,  i &apos;d go so far as to say it almost certainly will ,  in time .   why should i settle for that ? 
what ? 
i only mention it because i took the test this afternoon ,  down on montgomery street . 
excuse me ,  i need to explain .  .  . 
do you know what to do ? 
let &apos;s talk to whoever can get this over with .  .  . 
it &apos;s run by a company .  .  .  they play elaborate pranks .   things like this .  i &apos;m really only now finding out myself . 
it &apos;s much easier this way .   come on ,  step up .  .  . 
there &apos;s a ladder here . 
you &apos;re the one who started running . 
there goes a thousand dollars . 
never did catch your name . 
we hang down here and drop .   the garbage &apos;ll break our fall . 
nice . 
didn &apos;t think i &apos;d ever see you again . 
okay . 
take the picture out of the frame and show it to me . 
it wasn &apos;t his fault .   he thought it was his only way back .   they fleeced him real good . 
my name &apos;s not christine .   it &apos;s not my real .  .  . 
i don &apos;t know .   a lot . 
who is it ? 
what are you doing< / u> here ? 
it wasn &apos;t you .   it wasn &apos;t personal .  .  . 
what the fuck are you .  .  .   ? 
listen very carefully ,  i &apos;m telling the truth .  .  .  this is the game .   this was all the game . 
no ,  now wait .  .  .  think about it .   what did you see .  .  .   ? 
okay .  .  .  okay .  .  .   i put it down .   now open that door .  mister fisher &apos;s right on the other side of that door .   he &apos;s an actor .  .  . 
think about it !   they followed you every step of the way .   there was always a safety net .   the taxi ,  there was a diver .   at my house ,  the window was rigged .  .  .  they shot at us with blanks .  .  . 
originally ,  connecticut . 
they gave me a free jacket at the door . 
never better . 
who ? 
what have they been doing to you ? 
do you know how to change a tire ? 
you &apos;re behind this ,  aren &apos;t you ?   you and your sick friends .   well ,  make it stop ! 
what ? 
we &apos;ll help with the police ,  if you want to bother .   as far as money goes .  .  .  can i make a suggestion ?   you say you were mugged ? 
it would mean a lot to me .  .  .  if you and i could be friends .   if i could have you back in my life .  .  .  in some small way .   it would be important . 
we have to head out .  .  .  just wanted to say goodbye . 
we want a sense of your overall capabilities ,  limitations ,  turn - ons ,  turn - offs .  .  . 
we provide whatever &apos;s lacking . 
get rid of them . 
tell them the cops are after you .  .  .  tell them you &apos;ve got to talk to someone ,  i &apos;m threatening to blow the whistle . 
where ? 
thank you . 
not much ,  i think . 
your ex - wife . 
what the fuck .  .  .   ?  ! 
hey .  .  .   ! 
nicholas .  .  . 
he hasn &apos;t called back . 
that could have been worse . 
i gave my key to the gate to todd ,  but the dudleys &apos;ll be here in the morning . 
well ,  this lot is full ! 
we &apos;re fucked .   we &apos;re in a haunted house and we can &apos;t get out until the morning . 
that depends on your definition of ghosts .   i &apos;m going to check on her ,  and then i &apos;m going to stay awake . 
you used the wrong test . 
are you working with her ? 
the cold sensation .   who felt it first ? 
what did it smell like ? 
nell .  .  .  please ,  nell .  .  .  take a deep breath .  .  . 
i hadn &apos;t done a study of how group fear affects individual performance .   mass hysteria is like a story ,  nell .   a communal story .   someone starts it .   then we all add a little more to it .  and then for some reason  -  -  no one knows how  -  -  we start believing it .   this story shapes what we see and hear .   we interpret everything through it ,  make it fit the story .  i started our story when i gave you the history of hill house .  you &apos;ve added to it .   that &apos;s what this experiment has all been about .   that &apos;s what it was about ,  the experiment &apos;s over .   i &apos;m pulling the plug .   this is my fault . 
but you told me to look in the paper !   you told me i &apos;d be perfect ! 
this is where we &apos;re going ? 
me ?   no .   what are you doing here ? 
no one could .   no one lives any nearer than town . 
what did it cost ? 
jeez . 
yes .   i feel realy rested ,  too .  theo ? 
watts ? 
i &apos;ll take that as a compliment .   in the city ,  what kind of place do you live in ? 
this is real ,  i &apos;m not making it up !   theo ,  you saw it !   you were there  -  -  the banging and last night .   you ,  you all saw the painting ! 
oh ,  theo .   you know i don &apos;t have an apartment . 
gordon ?   he &apos;s been with me for years .  he &apos;s not as tough as he looks . 
not for you ,  clearly . 
it &apos;s not a compliment . 
it &apos;s just fuel to me .   i &apos;m not there for distractions . 
that &apos;s what gordon &apos;s always saying . 
hey . 
man knows what he likes . 
that &apos;s a high - end item .   total reliability . 
edward rama ? 
i didn &apos;t expect anyone . 
i mean ,  what has it been  -  -  six months ? 
bad place ,  man .   bad people .   some guys loading some trucks .   some kinda deal goin &apos; down .   i don &apos;t know and i don &apos;t care .   maybe they &apos;re shipping fava beans to eskimos . 
no .   not at all .   do we ? 
what &apos;s so fucking funny ? 
valets ,  eh ?   aren &apos;t we all la - de - da . 
well ,  that &apos;s what we &apos;re doin &apos; ,  n &apos; it . 
why didn &apos;t you just kill him ,  you had the chance . 
i was skint  -  -  didn &apos;t have no money to get here . 
and not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out .   from the wembley staduim job ,  wasn &apos;t it ?   pink floyd concert receipts .   jenny would &apos;ve been  .  .  .  fourteen at the time ? 
i can &apos;t believe jenny told you all that .  about me .   she was always so embarrassed . 
you haven &apos;t been lurking outside my building all day . 
i might &apos;ve been away for the weekend . 
lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing .   like me  -  -  but on a grander scale of failure . 
in what capacity are you employed by this mr .  lindgren ? 
terry &apos;s never going to give you satisfaction .   not the type . 
yeah ,  well ,  you &apos;re here now  -  -    -  -  where h< / u>urricanes h< / u>ardly ever h< / u>appen . 
i guess you &apos;re just habitual . 
where &apos;s big sur ? 
yeah ,  i guess you are . 
he &apos;d already grabbed more than his allotted cut .   didn &apos;t think he &apos;d be so bold as to take all of it . 
valentine had himself a party ,  i hear . 
so you wouldn &apos;t have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money . 
you &apos;ll be looking forward to getting back ,  then . 
makin &apos; trouble for someone ? 
 .  .  .  you can always tell the ones who &apos;ll do anal . 
looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth . 
i dunno .   i just said she &apos;s nice lookin &apos; . 
i don &apos;t get it . 
what &apos;s in it ? 
so why would he want to see you . 
is valentine here ? 
exercising my visitation rights . 
great bloke .   really turned things around there .   180 degrees . 
tell you  .  .  . 
 .  .  . you don &apos;t like the music out there ? 
you &apos;ve got talent ,  anyone could see that .  and he &apos;s the best .  if he thinks a student has talent ,  he &apos;ll take  &apos;em on for next to nothing .  you &apos;re a cinch to be accepted ,  i could cover the cost of the lessons ,  like i said ,  it &apos;s pretty modest -  - 
 .  .  . i stank ,  didn &apos;t i ? 
 .  .  . i guess i &apos;ve been all wet . 
 .  .  . i wanted to make you happy . 
 .  .  . mm . 
 .  .  . she can go up there . 
sure . 
 .  .  . it just goes to show ,  when one door slams shut ,  another one opens .  here &apos;s to ya ,  uh .  .  . 
 .  .  . that &apos;s quite a wife you got there . 
 .  .  . ed ,  i .  .  . 
would he .  .  .  it sounds pretty obvious . 
mm .  how ,  uh .  .  .  how did he know that -  - 
 .  .  . what a knucklehead . 
 .  .  . money problems .  he &apos;s thinking about canceling the annex . 
yeah . 
 .  .  . so you tie your own flies ,  ed .  i mean ,  if you &apos;re really serious .  you tie your own flies ,  you do a -  - i know it &apos;s matickless ,  i know ,  people say ,  hey ,  you can buy flies at the store -  -  but you can buy your fish at the store ,  ed ,  you see what i &apos;m saying ? 
i don &apos;t care what it costs !  this is when ya come together ! 
i don &apos;t understand . 
mr .  .  .  ? 
are you awake ?  .  .  .  is he awake ? 
there are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder .   claimed they saw a monster .  they &apos;re pretty determined to tell you their story .   you want to see them ? 
i &apos;m telling you ,  something &apos;s wrong .  i still haven &apos;t heard from pendergast .   i think you should call it off . 
i &apos;ve read about the museum &apos;s financial troubles . 
if the party goes forward ,  and that &apos;s a big if .  .  .  i &apos;ve arranged for a large police presence . 
forget it ! 
fifteen .  .  .  what &apos;s next ? 
it &apos;s fool proof ,  basically .   i designed this whole thing myself .  every valuable object in the museum carries a small electronic chip .   if anything &apos;s moved so much as an inch ,  we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft . 
ippolito !   get back here ! 
who are you ?   the undertaker ? 
did you read about a boat that washed up outside of new orleans about four months ago ?   twelve bodies on board . 
yes .   that &apos;s my case .   now it &apos;s yours .  all the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way .  decapitated .   brains extracted .   limbs torn to shreds .   it looked like the work of a large animal ,  but there was no sign of an animal on board . 
if you don &apos;t mind ,  this could be important . 
saliva test ?   you mean ,  you think someone ate part of the brain ? 
vince ?   there &apos;s no way we can get to you with the fire doors down .  there &apos;s an entrance to the sub -  basement in the hall off the north side exit . 
i smell it .   it &apos;s here . 
what &apos;s that ? 
i hope you liked it . 
please .   don &apos;t humiliate me further . 
with all due respect ,  dear ,  that &apos;s bull .   you dance rings around me with your new technology .   you &apos;ve left me in the dust . 
i can &apos;t help thinking there &apos;s something that pendergast overlooked .   if the scratches were made by whatever killed beauregard ,  it wants something that &apos;s in here . 
come back and get me . 
do you mean dr .  whittlesley ? 
you work here ? 
what do you do ? 
way cool .   then you know where the dinosaurs are . 
i don &apos;t want to go this way . 
and it snuffled the ground like a dog . 
stop ! 
jesus ,  what is this ? 
if i spent half the time on my fractal evolution thesis that i spend on this fly rod ,  i &apos;d have my phd . 
4 - monoxytocin is .  .  .   &quot; a hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland .  &quot; 
got to finish this thesis sometime . 
if he were alive he &apos;d have contacted me . 
disappeared .   his body wasn &apos;t among the victims . 
john couldn &apos;t have anything to do with a horrible thing like that .   he was a fine man despite his problems  -  - 
that was two years ago .   john was still in love with me .   he wouldn &apos;t leave me alone . 
a legendary monster called mbwun . 
i don &apos;t know .   he sent back a statue that &apos;s supposed to be an exact representation .   but i &apos;ve never seen it .   it &apos;s in the exhibit . 
it &apos;s okay ,  i &apos;m all right .   i remember now .  .  .  it was an animal .   something large !   i could smell it .   it was hunting me .   i saw two green eyes in the dark . 
dr .  green .  .  . 
what was it ? 
i don &apos;t know how to deal with this .  it &apos;s hellish .   like nothing i ever saw .   i &apos;m not trained to deal with a monster ,  a supernatural creature like that . 
hide quickly ! 
we have to try and draw it off ! 
that &apos;s a ptarmigan ,  feigning a broken wing .   the bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest ! 
no !   don &apos;t kill him !   pendergast ,  you were right .   it &apos;s john ! 
viti levu .   for how many ? 
you want to book the flight ? 
are we talking emmies ? 
who are you ? 
a show . < / i>  then who am i ? 
what &apos;s he doing ? 
you take japanese . 
no .  .  . i ,  er . 
well ,  what do you want to do ? 
truman ,  you know ,  i did think about moving away one time . 
what &apos;re we doing here ,  truman ? 
this &apos;ll pass .   everybody thinks like this now and then .   come to bed . 
come on ,  truman .   haven &apos;t you studied enough ? 
i &apos;ll take you home ,  angela .   why don &apos;t you leave those with us for a while ? 
i have to talk with you .   but not here .   let &apos;s go for a walk . 
arrah ! 
because i never have .   that &apos;s why you go places ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
what the hell has that got to do with anything ?   tell me what &apos;s happening ?  ! 
who were you talking to ?  ! 
it looks so small . 
is there any way around ? 
well ,  thank you for your help . 
just listen .   you remember when you were a little boy ,  you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like magellan -  - 
good .   good . 
see you tomorrow ,  truman . 
well ,  we &apos;re fbi agents . 
why don &apos;t you go home to the old lady  -  - 
they gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma .  but you &apos;ve been unconscious since they brought you in . 
i need your clothes ,  byers . 
i &apos;m looking for him . 
do i know you ? 
how &apos;d you find me ? 
the federal building was too well guarded . 
i think you &apos;re full of shit . 
i was right about dallas .  wasn &apos;t i ,  agent mulder ? 
what was it ? 
you &apos;d be shit out of luck if not for me .  you saw what you saw because i led you to it .  i &apos;m putting my ass on the line for you . 
mulder .  .  .  ? 
i saw your face ,  mulder .  there was a moment of panic . 
where are you ,  mulder ? 
scully ,  get somebody to open this door . 
mulder ?  tell me this is a joke . 
they were the ones that put us together . 
go home ,  mulder .  it &apos;s late . 
this is one of the firemen who died in dallas ? 
mulder ,  this is going to take some time ,  and somebody &apos;s going to figure out soon enough we &apos;re not even supposed to be here .   i &apos;m in serious violation of medical ethics . 
what kind of infection ? 
what did you find ? 
and where are they going with it ? 
what do you think it is ? 
where &apos;d they go ? 
what ?  what &apos;s wrong ? 
i have .  i did .  it &apos;s done . 
we &apos;ve got to keep moving . 
general mcaddie is who requested our coming here .  we were awakened at three am and told to get down here immediately . 
where &apos;s scully ? 
a virus ? 
this is what you &apos;ve been conspiring to conceal ?  a disease ? 
aids ,  the ebola virus  -  -  on the evolutionary scale they are newborns .  this virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs . 
until dallas ,  we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism .  that mass infection would make us a slave race . 
why are you telling me this ? 
you have precious little time .  what i &apos;ve given you the alien colonists have no idea exists .  you hold in your hand the power to end the project . 
my god .  .  . 
let me remind you who is the new race .  and who is the old .   what could be gained by withholding anything from them; by pretending to ignorance ?  our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable .  to start colonization early . 
 &quot; mocky - lock is the bogeyman ,  mocky - lock wants me where i am .  &quot; 
she adores you . 
miriam .  .  . 
i do it all the time ! 
i &apos;d be there for him . 
henry wants me to try this vietnamese place he &apos;s wild about .   want to come ? 
sing a song of sixpence . 
is it cold in here ? 
damn him . 
i refilled the zyprexa and atavan .  .  . 
you think you can do this ,  don &apos;t you ? 
it &apos;s hard for me to see stargher as human ,  capable of something like  &quot; remorse .  &quot; 
he wants us to follow .   the little boy .  .  . 
they &apos;re hungry . 
i hate to admit it ,  but there &apos;s something perversely satisfying about this . 
the phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago .   and we got the match . 
i don &apos;t know ,  pete ,  but for god &apos;s sake .  .  .  this is nuts .   do you really understand what they &apos;re going to do ? 
oh ,  what was the name of that doctor ?  harry &apos;s doctor ? 
harry ? 
the porter is going to talk to us tonight . 
might as well i suppose .  are you busy ? 
a moment ago you said you didn &apos;t want to see the porter . 
have you seen calloway ? 
he liked to laugh . 
what is on your mind ?  why did you hide ? 
that &apos;s his headache . 
 .  .  . quarrel ? 
 .  .  . anyway ? 
good evening ,  miss schmidt .  you remember me ? 
you know as much as i do ,  miss schmidt  -  you were intimate with lime ,  weren &apos;t you ? 
in one of his letters he asked you to telephone  -  a good friend of his called joseph .  he gave you the number of the casanova club .  that is where a lot of friends of lime used to go . 
now then ,  miss schmidt ,  i &apos;m not interested in your forged papers  -  that &apos;s purely a russian case .  when did you last see lime ? 
joseph harbin &apos;s body was found in the coffin . 
there you are ,  miss ,  your receipt for the letters . 
here we are .  you &apos;ll be all right here ,  miss . 
thank you ,  you have been so kind .  anna moves down to stand cl of paine . 
yes . 
please keep this passport to yourself ,  until i make some inquiries ,  will you ,  major ? 
 .  .  . austrian police headquarters . 
you &apos;ve had a bit of a shock ,  haven &apos;t you ?  you could do with a drink . 
back in school .  never so lonesome in my life till he showed up . 
 .  .  . expense . 
and there was a third man there .  i suppose that doesn &apos;t sound peculiar to you . 
 .  .  . be responsible for you in the streets . 
 .  .  . in the morning . 
look .  .  . i tell you ,  you don &apos;t think i &apos;m blind ,  do you ? 
it wouldn &apos;t work . 
do you mind if i drop off somewhere on the way ?  i &apos;ve got an appointment ,  won &apos;t take five minutes .  .  . 
what time is it ? 
welcome ? 
come upstairs a moment . 
seems exciting . 
zane grey . 
hello ,  harry . 
you told them ,  didn &apos;t you ? 
 .  .  . were of you . 
well ,  there was only you ,  and this friend of his .  who is he ? 
thank you . 
coffin ? 
 .  .  . popescu .  .  . 
happened .  .  . yes happened right down there . 
i was told that he did not die at once . 
yes ,  it is . 
wasn &apos;t he at the police inquiry ? 
he probably knows a lot more than that .  somebody &apos;s lying . 
no . 
 .  .  . mr .  martins ? 
lime .   harry lime . 
ten dollars .  i &apos;ll find a way to pay you back .  how would you like to know about somewhere special ?  the perfect beach .  paradise .  no one else knows about it .  that &apos;s got to be worth something .  what do you say ? 
yea ,  ok .  i will be ,  i will be ,  i promise . 
oh .  great .  not far at all .  i don &apos;t like to be negative ,  but do you think we should let someone know where we &apos;re going ? 
have you told someone ? 
i think so too . 
exactly .  always happened to someone else . 
watch your language .  .  .  . 
no ,  they don &apos;t .  not the smart ones .   look ,  i &apos;ll give you five grand if you can document your tax - exempt status .  .  .  .  but when you fall off this horse ,  come see me .  i can show you how to make a lot of money . 
you &apos;re not in school ?  what do you do ? 
 &quot;  .  .  . und die worte zerfielen mir im munde wie modrige pilze< / i> .  .  .  &quot; 
how come so many of the books are in spanish ? 
you think people ever commit suicide out of happiness ? 
i bet .  he didn &apos;t realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one . 
your father ?  ? 
where &apos;d you get this ? 
see ,  the jews love to separate things :  the holy from the profane ,  milk from meat ,  wool from linen ,  the sabbath from the week ,  the jew from the gentile .  .  .  .  as if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that . 
the sex is better . 
v &apos;asitem lechem pessel to - monat .  and make no graven image of the lord ,  or the form of any figure ,  or of man or woman ,  or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything .  because he &apos;s not like anything .  not only can &apos;t you see him or hear him ,  you can &apos;t even think about him .  i mean ,  what &apos;s the difference between that and him not existing ? 
christianity &apos;s silly ,  but at least there &apos;s something to believe in .  or not believe .  judaism there &apos;s nothing . 
come on ,  we can be like eichmann .  he studied torah .  he hated jews . 
look ,  just light the candles with me .  then we &apos;ll eat .  you have to eat . 
i didn &apos;t realize you cared . 
 .  .  . i thought we agreed ,  no anti -  semitism .  .  . it &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re trying to put behind us .  .  .  .  trash the blacks ,  fine; but .  .  . 
that would be a catastrophic mistake . 
they left an hour ago .   you mind some personal advice ?  forget carla .  that &apos;s not the side your bread &apos;s buttered on .   how soon can you get back to the city ? 
i &apos;m trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next .  .  .  . i thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting . 
you ever fuck a jewish girl ? 
and ?  what did you notice ? 
explain it so i can . 
tell me about lina moebius . 
how did you get the fucking number ? 
ah ,  jesus christ ,  danny ,  how can you wear that thing ?  .  .  .  you know what it means ?  to your people .  .  . 
hello .  .  .  ? 
i &apos;m doing a piece on right - wing groups ,  post oklahoma city .  i hear you &apos;re an important figure in those circles .  you have a lot of interesting ideas .  .  .  . 
open it up . 
this will be a different kind of device . 
the manzetti thing must have scared her .  she thinks she &apos;ll get implicated . 
danny ,  listen ,  people expect me to daven; they don &apos;t want someone they don &apos;t know  -  -  leading their prayers . 
how ? 
the torah says not to light a fire on the sabbath ,  because it &apos;s work ,  correct ?   but if alternating current &apos;s running through the wires every second of every day ,  and i throw a switch ,  send it here instead of there ,  how is that lighting a fire ? 
adam sandler . 
i &apos;m not an intellectual .  .  .  .  i mean ,  i read ,  but .  .  .  fund - raising isn &apos;t what i .  .  . 
are you out of your mind ?  ! 
do you think i .  .  . 
 .  .  . you &apos;re saying that when he first appeared at your house ,  you had no idea he was jewish .  .  .  . 
what do you mean ? 
and you .  .  .  ?   do you love enzo ? 
did you tell him ? 
the italian ,  i presume ? 
little .   very little .   and skinny ,  very skinny too .   that is compared to me . 
huh ?   well listen to him !   do you hear that ? 
the mamma &apos;s there too . 
jacques !   johana ! 
checking out the competition . 
what else is there ? 
 .  .  .  not yet . 
dollars . 
in my village ,  we have a saying :  when the wind blows ,  the flags of all nations flap in the same direction . 
where did you get that ? 
and where did you say you were from ? 
you don &apos;t mind if i go instead ,  do you ? 
that &apos;s good . 
so ,  not married .   well ,  good for you .   you play the field ,  like me .  a girl in every port ,  huh ? 
why ? 
why ?   are they what &apos;s most important ? 
 .  .  .  everything . 
here .  .  .   here .  .  . 
 .  .  .  i was seventeen ,  i loved her so much i tried to die for her .  two years later i couldn &apos;t even remember her name !   let me tell you ,  time erases everything ! 
 .  .  .  how long was i asleep ? 
i &apos;m concentrating . 
it &apos;s not safe ,  they say .   the doctors say it isn &apos;t possible to go deeper and live .   free diving is over as a sport . 
i recognize you . 
thanks for helping with the bag .   it looks great ! 
i thought you &apos;d be at the dinner . 
she &apos;s not like the others .   she can &apos;t stand to be away from the sea . 
i &apos;m being a pain ,  huh ? 
bonjour monsieur .  .  .  louis .  
what &apos;s wrong ? 
you want to lie down for a while ? 
you &apos;ve got to tell me what happened ? 
promise me one thing . 
hey !   have you ever seen a mermaid ? 
assassin ! 
what were italians doing living in greece anyway ? 
you &apos;re back !   hello .   we were burgled . 
well ? 
 .  .  .  since eight o &apos;clock last night .  .  .  !   you &apos;re in love . 
who .  .  .  who is that ? 
 .  .  .  the truck fell into a very deep crevasse .   we weren &apos;t able to save the equipment . 
he &apos;s in the fluoroscope now .   listen to his heart .   impressive ,  huh ?  the flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn &apos;t even feed the limbs anymore .   it &apos;s a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins .  .  .  until now . 
shouldn &apos;t somebody take him a blanket or something ? 
wait !   professor .  .  .  ? 
chief ,  it &apos;s me .  listen carefully .  i need for the worldwide jewish media conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive jewish protagonist as its lead . 
it was a trap .  i &apos;m back at square one . 
good thinking .  we &apos;ll disguise ourselves as a gentile couple to pass undetected .  now that he thinks i &apos;m dead ,  this should be a piece of homentashen . 
looks like i got a plane to catch . 
so why the long face ? 
any sign of santa ? 
i want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons .  little abraham will go to stanford for college ,  batya will go ivy league ,  maybe vassar . 
oh my god .  she &apos;s become my pimp .  and she &apos;s whoring her bitch - son out to the highest bidder . 
we do ! 
i love you too .  i &apos;m sorry about freaking out yesterday .  i was wrong . 
mordechai .  do you love your mother ? 
i don &apos;t want to argue with you .  let &apos;s just eat in peace . 
let &apos;s let your tuchus breathe . 
actually ,  i .  .  . i don &apos;t .  what does that mean ? 
hey everybody .  how &apos;s it hangin &apos; ? 
so what &apos;s in the boxes ?  heroin ?  cocaine ? 
bootleg copies of the frank capra classic ,   &apos;it &apos;s a wonderful life .  &apos;
you okay ? 
get off of me you cripple ! 
well ,  charlie ,  just why do you think your cat didn &apos;t kill the contreras girl ? 
they don &apos;t say it to me . 
where &apos;s that man ? 
i want him to lock me up . 
north  -  -  in an arroyo ,  shot through the head  -  maybe week ago .  no good ,  skin ,  everything gone 
you and your cards .  meet a rich man !  i look for them with money .  what rich man hasn &apos;t money .  and for what was i born if it wasn &apos;t for money ?  you &apos;re not telling me anything . 
something black  -  something on its way to you 
see you tomorrow  - 
love is different for different people . 
it may sound like music to her  -  -  i can do better with my teeth in a cold shower .   click  click  click . 
why not ?  he &apos;s a good press agent and a good friend .  besides ,  we &apos;ve shared a lot of headaches 
i mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl . 
oh ,  mr .  galbraith !  i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re here . 
well ,  i &apos;d best be off . 
you know about animals  -  -  their habits  -  -  will it come back ? 
there is no danger at all .  it &apos;s a wild animal .  do you think a wild animal prefers walls ,  streets and people when it can get into open country ? 
doc  -  -  something you said the other day  -  - 
just a minute ,  robles .   let him go on . 
we had given up digging in a certain barrow .  i went back and i tried again .  i just had a hunch . 
it was you . 
tell me . 
yes ,  there is something wrong .  people who want publicity and don &apos;t mind how they get it  -  - what risks they make other people run  -   -  what agony and sorrow they bring to other people  -  - 
makes no difference .   get him out . 
who was the other man ? 
our first real break  -  -  and we throw wild animals at the audience
confession .  i &apos;m a complete softie .  i &apos;ve been conscience - stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away  -  - 
you already know the answer to that .  i want this town to be safe and happy again  -  - 
jerry ,  i want you to be soft .  you are soft  -  -  inside  -  where it matters .  i wanted it that day too ,  but didn &apos;t dare tell you . 
ha - ha .  .  .  yeah .  .  .   what about that road back there ,  though ?  it says closed to the public ,  doesnt it ? 
that might depend on where youre going . 
de moraes ?  i was asked here by a mrs spitz . 
good afternoon .  de moraess residence . 
im afraid they are out at the moment ,  sir . 
laurence ! 
minimizes the risks .  children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses .  these can also be used to move women and drugs .  .  .  anything that makes money really . 
when did you get back ? 
or is it the other way round ?  the children are needed because you cant satisfy him ? 
how .  .  .  when did you .  .  . 
what do you mean ,  no ,  mrs de moraes ? 
is there anything to understand ? 
five years of it .  surely ,  youd have divorced him if he disgusted you ? 
a fright ?  .  .  .  five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright ? 
to get me killed .  .  .  ? 
do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser ,  deborah ?  and then ,  your brothers not buried yet .  as i said earlier ,  an autopsy will .  .  . 
penrhyndeudraeth ,  north wales . 
good morning ,  sir .  how can i help you ? 
youre sure you wont sit down ,  miss stewart ? 
no answer .  you have no passport and your embassys out .  how do you plan to leave the u . s .  ,  mr lombard ? 
what am i to do with the packages if .  .  . 
look ,  you dont tell me about some godforsaken place where stuff so bad even i couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep !  what happened ?  whos the guy ?  the austrian ? 
what .  .  .  ? 
im finished here and im tired ,  emily .  you shouldnt be here .  now dont make it worse .

im calling about the puppies . 
why ? 
how much of a hurry are you in ? 
fifteen for a straight delivery .  twenty with the provision of a safe place .  visitors tend to find the second option more convenient . 
whats this place ?  a hotel of some kind ? 
there were six on offer ,  you scumbag .  where are the other five ? 
the hyatt .  good afternoon .  may i help you ? 
oh .  .  .  we split up . 
lombard ,  this is not a jewish name ,  is it ? 
what if it is ? 
whatever ,  you come recommended .  we .  .  . 
my husband and i will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in israel .  deborah will be here if you need anything before our return . 
vous tes franais ? 
where is friedman ? 
and while visiting our fair city you .  .  .   an austrian ?

welcome to the club . 
yeah .  why ?  youre going to look for her .  .  .  shit !  you really think his pictures are that good ? 
jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre .   pas avant la matine . 
five seconds .  then you die . 
try again ,  and this time be polite . 
mossad ? 
what do you mean ? 
sire ,  you know how bad i am at this sort of game . 
better today than tomorrow . 
he didn &apos;t tell you to cut all your hair off .  .  .  ! 
jeanne .  .  .  !   are you alright ? 
it &apos;s been weeks since they spoke to me .   since the coronation .  .  .  no signs .  .  .  nothing .  .  . 
well of course they &apos;re me !   that &apos;s how god talks to me .   if you listen hard enough ,  even you can hear him .  everyone can hear him . 
no ,  but .  .  . 
do as i say ! 
my gentle captain .  .  .  i &apos;m staying . 
no .  .  . 
it was on a sunday ,  wasn &apos;t it ? 
yes ,  probably .  .  .  maybe .  .  . 
well .  .  .  at the coronation of king charles vi .  .  . 
calm down ,  my lord ,  i beg you ! 
god defeated the english ,  not me . 
really ? 
don &apos;t worry about me  -  -  just stay in here .  .  .  and don &apos;t move ! 
oh ,  thank you lord !   i &apos;m so glad to see you !   i need to confess .  .  .  i haven &apos;t been confessed since easter .  .  .  or been to mass .  .  .  will you hear me now ? 
you will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked . 
so .  .  .  begin by telling us your name  -  -  assuming you &apos;re allowed to tell us that much ? 
show us a little more cooperation first .   where were you born ? 
i assure you they do .   so .  .  .  answer me .  .  .  when was the last time you heard this voice ? 
good day ,  sir .   i trust my honorable duke of burgundy is feeling well ? 
 .  .  .  and what .  .  .  what did he say ? 
get them out of here ! 
you told us about the appearance of this .  .  .  voice .   what exactly did you see ?   part of it .  .  .  or all of it ? 
is it long and hanging down ? 
may i ,  without offending you ,  inquire how generous ? 
well .   i &apos;d love to see that ,  but after taking counsel with my captains ,  i felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city ,  then wait till alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything . 
 &quot; be patient ,  be patient &quot;  .  .  .  is that the only advice you can ever come up with ?  ?   i &apos;ve shown more patience than a dozen saints ! 
but .  .  .  don &apos;t you think we should at least .  .  .  go and .  .  .  welcome her ? 
brilliant idea .  .  .  but to be really effective ,  why not send a whole army of virgins ? 
there must be something we can do for her for chrissakes ! 
clear ? 
bravo !   what about all the other hundreds of prisoners ?   do we let them go too ? 
jeanne .  .  .  we &apos;re not enough .  .  . 
yeah .  .  . 
i swear i &apos;ll never swear again in my life if you save her life !   but i &apos;m warning you ,  if you let her die ,  then you &apos;re the biggest .  .  . 
you call this .  .  .  glory .  .  .  ?   all this .  .  .  this blood .  .  .  this smell of .  .  . 
how many did he give you ? 
still ,  pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn &apos;t you say ? 
jeanne .  .  .  what are you doing ? 
i don &apos;t know .  .  .  please .  .  .  tell me i &apos;m dead .  .  . 
i &apos;m not lying ,  i .  .  .  i can &apos;t remember .  .  .  leave me alone ! 
my voices .  .  .  my voices .  .  .  do you think they will ever come back ? 
you know what you just signed ,  jeanne ?   you just signed away my existence .  .  .  for you i &apos;m a lie ,  an illusion .   you see ?   in the end ,  you were the one who abandoned me .  .  . 
you think you are ready now ? 
i saw a poor monk without shoes so i gave him some . 
so .  .  .  everything sounds .  .  .  wonderful ? 
then .  .  .  why are you here so often ? 
only god knows the answer to that . 
don &apos;t worry ,  it won &apos;t last long . 
let me see this . 
it &apos;s not going to be very comfortable . 
can you help us ? 
no ,  no .  listen ,  i &apos;ve been thinking  -  - 
it &apos;s nothing to do with you .  it &apos;s me they wanted ,  not you .  why do you interfere in other people &apos;s business ? 
they &apos;re in shock .  they didn &apos;t expect it .  nobody expected it .  jews fighting back ?  who &apos;d have thought ? 
jehuda ,  give me something to do .

i knew she was mute ,  but now i &apos;m thinking it &apos;s more than that .  i &apos;m wondering if she &apos;s not brain affected .

what are you going to do ? 
come on out ,  now .   he won &apos;t hurt you .   back to your old tricks ,  eh ,  tanner ? 
well ,  based on my knowledge of the region ,  its culture and her people i would have to say it &apos;s a box . 
yeah !   welcome to beautiful iraq .   land of enchantment and riches . 
what ? 
they stopped . 
the us army :   always an adventure . 
otherwise whatever we &apos;re looking for could be anywhere . 
i don &apos;t think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins .   wes !  ?   we &apos;ll send the gold up ,  then me and jaeger &apos;ll climb back . 
we are not at war !   you and i and jaeger are awol .   we have no authority -  - 
i &apos;m not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around .   i have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don &apos;t have the stomach to do what has to be done . 
you &apos;ve got an awful lot of orders in you .  always giving orders . 
wes ,  we thought you were dead ,  and we thought we were next .   hanging around to get killed wouldn &apos;t have done anyone any good . 
just keep quiet . 
this is stupid .   it &apos;s going on a month now .   how long are they going to let the air force piss on those bastards ?   they can bomb them all they want ,  saddam ain &apos;t going anywhere without a ground assault .  what the hell is the army waiting for ? 
they finally start the ground war ,  and where are we ?   same place we &apos;ve been since we got here .   securing freedom for the dirt . 
you can &apos;t tell anybody about this .

i want you to know .  .  .  i don &apos;t know .   i just think you &apos;re a hell of a guy . 
we ought to kick their asses anyway .  even if they do get out of kuwait we ought to kick their asses . 
what is this ? 
jaeger ? 
we &apos;re going to war ,  aren &apos;t we .   if they &apos;re doing all that it must mean we &apos;re going to war . 
you ever think about it ?   you ever worry ? 
the longer the air force hits the iraqis ,  the safer it &apos;ii be for us when we have to engage . 
that &apos;s it .   it &apos;s over .   eighteen hours into the war and it &apos;s over . 
you don &apos;t know where the iraqis have moved to .   and our forces haven &apos;t even engaged the republican guard yet ,  we don &apos;t know -  - 
you two don &apos;t even know how crazy you are .   you want to go on your sick ,  little treasure hunt then go ahead ,  but mark me absent . 
epps .  .  .

but ,  madame ,  you keep a hundred thousand francs -  - in your safe -  - at home< / u> ?

he said to turn loose of him . 
what &apos;d the messican mean ,  a sick horse &apos;s gonna get us ?   didn &apos;t make no sense .

yeah ? 
that thunder &apos;s sure somethin &apos; . 
i am usin &apos; it ,  wyatt .   been wonderin &apos; how the hell we got in this tangle .   you know they hit clum &apos;s house ,  too ?   shot up his wife .  his wife .   who ever heard of that ?   men sneakin &apos; around in the dark ,  back - shootin &apos; ,  scarin &apos; women ?   they &apos;re bugs ,  wyatt .   you know all your smart talk about live and let live ?   ain &apos;t no live and let live with bugs . 
you were right ,  wyatt .   they got me good .   don &apos;t let  &apos;em get you too .

pretty fun too ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
maybe i jumped the gun .   maybe those cowboys aren &apos;t near as bad as they &apos;re painted .   you know i was thinkin &apos; ,  there &apos;s a lot of money in the cattle business .  .  . 
wait till the liquor wears off .  once they start getting headaches they &apos;ll lose interest . 
getting late .   guess i &apos;ll turn in . 
why don &apos;t you just leave it alone ? 
you see ,  mr .  bond ,  you and i are both men of action .  but your era is passing .  words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery .  and make no mistake about it :  in the right hands ,  they can be as deadly as your walther ppk . 
yes .  and do try to keep all four of them on the road .   all the usual refinements :  smoke ,  missiles ,  machine guns  -   fully operational remote control .  drives forward ,  reverse  -   stop that !   plus infrared thermal imaging radar ,  heads up instrumentation ,  and 17 beverage cup holders . 
yes  - 
yes ,  the ship is down there .  but the gold is gone . 
what about the uranium ? 
i &apos;m so sorry ,  james .  i promise ,  i &apos;ll never leave you again . 
can you arrange a meeting ? 
married ? 
pity .   bring him whatever he wants . 
insurance .  lloyds of london . 
and what do you call this ? 
if i were you  - 
what do you make of all this ? 
who is that ?  !  ?  what &apos;s in the box ?  ? 
what time is it ?  do you think you can just treat us like your slave ?  it &apos;s after one . 
when are you going to find time to help me fix the roof ? 
coffee is bad for anybody ,  especially for a child . 
why don &apos;t you come in for a while ? 
you would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1 / 2 baths mean . 
why does he always pick on me ? 
linda ,  how come you don &apos;t see that sunny puts his shoes on right ? 
it was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like . 
who is it ? 
i was hoping you came to the door instead of him .  it gets cold at night . 
i &apos;m going back home with harry . 
i &apos;m trying to make him a man but you keep babying him . 
i &apos;m worn out . 
what ,  are you having another party ? 
good morning . 
next time when i feel a little better perhaps . 
what could have caused this ?  i just changed this damn thing . 
those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person . 
i have someone i want you to meet . 
i don &apos;t make no bones about where i &apos;m going to spend eternity .  i have always been wild and you know that .  if you are made to feel half a man ,  what do you think the other half is ? 
hocker &apos;s death almost caused a race riot .  a lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that . 
harry ,  that &apos;s not nice .  i &apos;m in church now . 
some people grow up and change their ways . 
you know the saying ,   &quot; your heart is in your left hand .  &quot; 
some folks take that natural stuff too far . 
you know okra asked me to marry him the other evening . 
now you don &apos;t have to say anything if you don &apos;t want to . 
can i bring some toys ? 
next stop .  .  . 
yes ,  i can . 
that is sid !

nice work ,  fellahs .   good job .  comin &apos; out of the ground  -  -  what a touch !   that was a stroke of genius . 
hold on ,  woody ! 
it doesn &apos;t matter how much we &apos;re played with .   what matters is that we &apos;re here for andy when he needs us .   that &apos;s what we &apos;re made for .  right ?  everyone is now looking down ,  sheepish . 
no ,  no !   turn  &apos;em around ,  turn  &apos;em around ! 
son of a building block ,  it &apos;s woody ! 
i dunno . 
gettin &apos; kind of tense ,  aren &apos;t you ? 
no wait !   you don &apos;t understand !  buzz is out there !   we &apos;ve gotta help him !  ! 
shouldn &apos;t they be there by now ?  what &apos;s taking them so long ?  ! 
they &apos;re getting bigger . 
it &apos;s sid ! 
it &apos;s too short !   we need more monkeys ! 
i got it ,  woody ! 
uh ,  hey sarge ,  have you seen slinky ? 
sargent .   establish a recon post downstairs .   code red .   you know what to do . 
come in ,  mother bird ,  this is alpha bravo . 
there . 
i &apos;m red this time . 
curled up on the landing like love locked out ! 
what was that< / i> in aid of ? 
finn ,  there &apos;s a splinter in your left foot .   if you don &apos;t let me take the splinter out ,  it will fester . 
he &apos;ll murder you when he finds out . 
they &apos;re going to fly everywhere .  mean things .  they should have taken us . 
did you do this ? 
what is he planning on telling them ? 
good .   from now on i want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape - recorded ,  that the movement of your lips is being read .  got it ? 
helena  -  - 
did you get it ? 
it &apos;s the same stuff ?   from the rainy day stash ? 
so you know we put the case before the arbitration panel ,  none of whom had any expertise .   superfund is just one of those words .   people stop paying attention . 
should we bring the police into this ? 
where are you going ? 
czar for life ,  just like a real czar . 
hi . 
i don &apos;t know . 
ach ,  that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about .  sarcasm .   always fucking sarcasm .  you &apos;re afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you &apos;re weak or won &apos;t like you  -  - 
move  &apos;em to texas ,  fry  &apos;em up . 
that &apos;s a big word for a fisherman . 
remember when we sat on that mob guy ,  that chef ,  for like six months ? 
all the professionals keep them in the trunk . 
david  -  - 
you may speak . 
i don &apos;t really like guns .   you shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive . 
they &apos;re going to walk right past me . 
this attitude &apos;s not gonna help him any ,  is it ? 
bring this man a change of good clothes .   has he eaten ? 
take this back with you .   deliver it safely to tigrillo in san diego and we have a deal . 
you will help me with my other problem . 
relax .   if they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert . 
yeah .   it should be fun .   you wanna come ? 
it &apos;s important that we work together .  mexico .   america .   one hand washing the other . 
does this offer include my partner ? 
i &apos;m curious how you did this with such economy . 
who the fuck do you think you are ?  where the fuck do you think you are ?  why the fuck do you think i shouldn &apos;t just put you in a dumpster ? 
i &apos;m not the police .   i don &apos;t care about experimentation .   she &apos;s a kid .  i &apos;m worried to death . 
hey man ,  i &apos;m sorry .   i &apos;m just trying to help . 
hello . 
i want the money ,  mark ,  that &apos;s all . 
no ,  i don &apos;t mean like that  -  -  i mean something nice ,  like ,  that &apos;s all  -  - 
two thousand ,  one hundred and thirty -  three pounds . 
in that case you can do it .  you were quite happy to do a lot more last night . 
you &apos;re too young . 
i read it in cosmopolitan . 
what do you mean ,  it &apos;s  &apos;gone &apos; ?  where has it gone ,  tommy ? 
strive ,  hope ,  believe and conquer . 
no ,  actually i went to craignewton but i was worried that you wouldn &apos;t have heard of it so i put the royal edinburgh college instead ,  because they &apos;re both schools ,  right ,  and we &apos;re all in this together ,  and i wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details ,  yeah ?  people get all hung up on details ,  but what &apos;s the point ?  like which school ?  does it matter ?  why ?  when ?  where ?  or how many o grades did i get ?  could be six ,  could be one ,  but that &apos;s not important .  what &apos;s important is that i am ,  right ?  that i am . 
you take the test ? 
that &apos;s nice . 
i chose not to choose life :  i chose something else .  and the reasons ?  there are no reasons .  who need reasons when you &apos;ve got heroin ? 
people think it &apos;s all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite ,  which is not to be ignored ,  but what they forget  -  spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it .  otherwise we wouldn &apos;t do it .  after all ,  we &apos;re not fucking stupid .  at least ,  we &apos;re not that fucking stupid .  take the best orgasm you ever had ,  multiply it by a thousand and you &apos;re still nowhere near it .  when you &apos;re on junk you have only one worry :  scoring .  when you &apos;re off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite .  got no money :  can &apos;t get pished .  got money :  drinking too much .  can &apos;t get a bird :  no chance of a ride .  got a bird :  too much hassle .  you have to worry about bills ,  about food ,  about some football team that never fucking wins ,  about human relationships and all the things that really don &apos;t matter when you &apos;ve got a sincere and truthful junk habit . 
screenwriter ? 
fuck off !  he never wrote any of them . 
you don &apos;t know ,  do you ? 
it &apos;s certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life . 
well ,  at one time ,  you &apos;ve got it ,  and then you lose it ,  and it &apos;s gone for ever .  all walks of life :  george best ,  for example ,  had it and lost it ,  or david bowie ,  or lou reed  - 
i don &apos;t rate that at all . 
yeah ,  beautifully fucking illustrated . 
why ? 
yeah .  no more .  i &apos;m finished with that shite . 
he &apos;s always been lacking in moral fibre . 
that &apos;s hardly a substitute . 
it &apos;s fresh air . 
big time .  absolutely fucking radge .   &apos;it &apos;s me or iggy pop ,  time to decide .  &apos;
sulu ,  what are you doing ? 
on  &quot; the planet of galactic peace ?  &quot;

when he encouraged others to follow him ,  he was banished from vulcan ,  never to return . 
spock . 
what you have done is betray every man on this ship . 
i ordered you to defend this ship . 
is it possible ? 
you &apos;re right .  i &apos;m a little out of practice .   uh .  .  .  . that &apos;s an  &quot; s .  &quot; 
i believe i have found a faster way . 
spock .

how did you do that ,  flynn ? 
yori ,  steer us over the beam ,  right next to it . 
you &apos;ll be having plenty of chances to get hurt ,  don &apos;t worry about that . 
hey ,  ram  .  .  .  what were you  .  .  .  you know ,  before ? 
flynn !  look ,  tron ,  he survived ! 
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s a little late for that .  dillinger &apos;s shut off group 7 access .  he must know what you &apos;re up to . 
hey ,  you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games .  .  .  cheap ? 
yes .  .  . acknowledge ,  master control .  .  . 
the users .  .  . you really think they &apos;re still there ?

dana ,  are you listening to me ? 
how was school today ? 
dad ,  how come you know the words ? 
and this is a little above market -     * rate for the horizontal bop ,  even    * for a total biscuit like her . 
they call him  &quot; the sand spider &quot;  .     *

she &apos;s importing stuff from all over the mid - east . 
hey ,  did that guy harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet ?   cause apparently that &apos;s the only way we &apos;re going to catch the son of a bitch  -  -

abu kaleem malik .

same thing happened to me with wife two .   i had no idea until i came home and the house was empty .   i mean empty .   she even took the ice - cube trays from the fridge .   what kind of person would think of that ? 
is this national security stuff boring you ?

yes . 
i &apos;m sorry .   thank you for the party . 
uh huh . 
they said you had to run out . 
i thought we might have lunch tomorrow .

you weren &apos;t attracted to him at all ? 
that &apos;s none of your goddamn business !   what kind of questions are these ? 
i think so . 
natasha ?

as much as you used to ? 
what &apos;re we talking about here ?  pussy ,  right ? 
let &apos;s face it ,  harry ,  the vette gets  &apos;em wet .   but it &apos;s not enough .   if you want to really close escrow ,  you gotta have an angle . 
well ,  think of it as playing a role .   it &apos;s fantasy .   you have to work on their dreams .   get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours . 
doesn &apos;t matter .   i like change .  you know ,  constant turnover .   as soon as i close the deal ,  it &apos;s one of two more times ,  then adios . 
but with you ,  she gets to be hot ,  right ? 
see .   you and this car were meant for each other .   why fight it ?  sure ,  i have a couple other buyers lined up ,  but i like your style .   whattya say ?   should we start on the paperwork ?

clarence .  .  .

i grow it on my window - sill .  the lights really great there and i &apos;m up high enough so you can &apos;t see it from the street . 
coco leaves .  you see ,  they take the leaves and mash it down until it &apos;s kind of a paste  - 
no .  no ,  you don &apos;t .

you &apos;re a fuckin &apos; star !  and you &apos;re gonna be playin &apos; your little one - man show nightly for the next two fuckin &apos; years for a captive audience  - 
and just think ,  when you get out in a few years ,  you &apos;ll meet some girl ,  get married ,  and you &apos;ll be so understanding to your wife &apos;s needs ,  because you &apos;ll know what it &apos;s like to be a woman .

the food ,  the sky ,  the certain ,  uh ,  sexual temptations  -  -  you haven &apos;t become  &quot; addicted &quot;  have you ,  cole ?   to that  &quot; dying &quot;  world &apos;
he &apos;s drugged out of his mind !   he &apos;s completely zoned out . 
i told you that fuckhead mason would get us into something like this . 
that &apos;s him . 
let &apos;s consider again our current information  -  -  if the symptoms were first detected in philadelphia on june 28 ,  1995 ,  that makes us know that .  .  .  ? 
i &apos;m going to be completely honest .   i &apos;m not going to lie to you .   i can &apos;t make the police let you go .  .  . but i do want to help you .   and i want you to trust me .   can you do that ,  james ?   may i call you  &quot; james &quot;  ? 
why not ?   most people have some id . 
you &apos;ve been in an institution ,  haven &apos;t you ,  james ?   a hospital ? 
it was some lady .   she didn &apos;t know anything . 
james ,  where did you grow up ?   was it around here ?   around baltimore ? 
did something terrible happen to you when you were a child ?   something so bad .  .  .  ? 
are you hurt ? 
mason ?  ?  ? 
you smell so good . 
i don &apos;t understand what we &apos;re doing . 
you had a bullet from world war one in your leg ,  james !   how did it get there ? 
i think i &apos;ve seen this movie before .  when i was a kid .   it was on tv . 
why are we doing this ? 
i mean in my dream  -  -  i didn &apos;t realize it was you .   then .  .  . i woke up and i .  .  . i thought you were gone . 
what .  .  .  .  ?  ?  ? 
county hospital ,  right ?   1989 .   the  &quot; immaculate escape &quot;   -  -  am i right ?   why ,  thank you  -  -  you look wonderful ,  too . 
jo .  .  . jose ?  ?  ?  ?

he kidnapped you ,  kathryn .   you saw him murder someone .   you knew there was a real possibility he would kill you ,  too .   you were under tremendous emotional stress . 
what .  .  . virus ? 
why don &apos;t we forget my goddamn psychiatrist and deal with the task at hand .   this is important . 
who cares what psychiatrists write on walls ?   you think i told her about the army of the 12 monkeys ?   impossible !   know why ,  you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous  &quot; pretend - friend - to -  animals &quot;  ?  !   i &apos;ll tell you why :   because when i had anything to do with her six years ago ,  there was no such thing  -  -  i hadn &apos;t even thought of it yet ! 
yes ,  please .   you said he gave a name .  .  . 
you sure got a lot of philosophy ,  old man . 
i &apos;ll take a piece of that bet .  i say it doesn &apos;t come up five times each side . 
you ain &apos;t nothing but an old fool . 
please ,  you don &apos;t understand .   i have to get out of here .   they &apos;re going to come looking for me .  they &apos;re going to kill me .   if i can &apos;t get this ticket then i &apos;m going to have to do things to get out of here .   i don &apos;t want to hurt anybody ,  i just want to leave . 
nope .   darrell . 
will he be back soon ? 
then why do you call it harlin &apos;s ? 
about an hour and a half ,  because that &apos;s all the longer i &apos;ve been gone . 
well ,  now ,  you just know all there is about bein &apos; a mechanic ,  don &apos;t you ?   i can &apos;t do unauthorized work .  i suppose i can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket .   then you get in an accident and get killed .   or worse .   who they gonna blame then ?   they gonna blame me ,  and there goes my reputation . 
we ain &apos;t got no beck &apos;s . 
shasta !   now why &apos;d you go and scare the nice man like that ?   sorry about that ,  hon .   enjoy your beer ,  and try to have a nice day . 
what &apos;s the matter ? 
i don &apos;t hear anything .   you were dreaming .   or maybe the wind blew something over . 
do you have to call me that ? 
i got it . 
no ,  i &apos;ve got it . 
it &apos;s nothing .   really . 
that a fact ? 
that &apos;s good .   cools you right off .   i saw you watching me . 
i guess .   i &apos;ve got an ego same as any man . 
there .   all done .   lift me down . 
beautiful ? 
and i take it things didn &apos;t much work out the way you planned . 
i don &apos;t know how . 
please .   i won &apos;t hang on you .   as soon as we get there you can dump me .   i don &apos;t care .   i just want to get out of here . 
he &apos;s got money .   in a floor safe in the living room .   i &apos;ve never seen it ,  but he talks about it all the time .   more like brags .   he loves his money .   wouldn &apos;t think of spending some of it on me . 
i &apos;ve thought about you every second since i left .   i can still taste you on my lips . 
i mean it ,  grace .   i &apos;m getting out of here ,  and i want to take you with me . 
why the hell didn &apos;t you do anything ? 
you don &apos;t know ?   jesus christ !  don &apos;t you think you should have found out before we killed him ? 
if it isn &apos;t here ,  why would he wear that stupid key ? 
i got the money all packed .   i put the jeep in the garage .   figure that way people will think maybe me and jake went away .   might buy us some time . 
john  .   .   .  ? 
you &apos;re crazy ,  you know that !  ?  you &apos;re fucked up !  ? 
jesus ,  grace .   did you have to kill him ? 
i know .   he was to take the fucking money . 
well ,  nothing . 
are you all right ? 
john ,  if you don &apos;t throw me the keys ,  then i &apos;ll just walk away .  walk away and leave you here . 
you a sailor man ?   that &apos;d be the life .   drive across the country ,  step on a boat and just sail away .  a man could pretty well disappear like that .   just sail away until all he was was a memory .   i guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile . 
it wouldn &apos;t have made a difference to you ,  now would it ?   not a wit .  do you know why ?   because you &apos;re a man without scruples . 
she does at that .   i knew when i married her she was a free spirit .  a woman with her looks and a man my age; what was i to expect ?   but you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don &apos;t think ,  you do .  so ,  i married her .   what are you to do ,  eh ?   women . 
good lord .   what happened to you ? 
hungry ? 
you said you had an insurance policy out on your wife .   fifty - thousand dollars . 
because i think you &apos;re a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money . 
that &apos;s a bit much . 
you drive a hard bargain ,  but i had a feeling you were my boy when i met you . 
i guess i might as well get this done with . 
you could say .   i don &apos;t even have it yet . 
that &apos;s not the reason i &apos;m here .   i swear it . 
it &apos;s the truth ,  jake . 
is that what happened ?   did you even make it out to the desert ,  or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets ? 
not from where i stand . 
i want to stay . 
toby !   toby tyler ,  leave him alone ! 
but you was going to fight for me . 
that &apos;s what i thought until you came riding in .   i saw your car over at the gas station .   it &apos;s cool .   want to take me for a ride ?   desert &apos;s kind of lonely this time of day . 
eighteen .   well ,  i &apos;m gonna be eighteen in two years ,  but that don &apos;t mean you can &apos;t take me for a ride if you want . 
toby tyler ,  it don &apos;t matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he &apos;s just drooling and bleeding all over hisself ,   &apos;cause we love each other and we gonna run off ,  and i &apos;m gonna have his love child . 
i wasn &apos;t doing anything . 
they &apos;re not very imaginative ? 
fine .   i was making time with your girl .   now i &apos;m all scared ,  and i &apos;ll never make that mistake again .   now go away . 
oh ,  that tears it ,  mister .   i &apos;m gonna bust you up but good .   i &apos;m gonna bust you into a million pieces and then  .   .   .  and then bust those pieces up ,  and then  .   .   .  and then spread them all around .   that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do .   you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re dealing with ,  mister .   i &apos;m crazy .   i &apos;m psycho crazy . 
i &apos;m doing what any man would do if he &apos;d been offended .   i &apos;m beating you up . 
mexico ?   you &apos;re going to mexico ? 
he is at that .   no so much a fault of his own .   poor boy had quite a trauma as a child . 
i didn &apos;t do anything . 
soda .   you got any soda ? 
no police !   wait until i &apos;m gone . 
don &apos;t call me old man .   ain &apos;t you got no respect ,  boy ? 
i ain &apos;t got no eyes .   you want to see ? 
maybe i do . 
i think i &apos;ve heard that before . 
i thought you said you lost your eyes in the war ? 
night is when you want to sleep ,  but the dry heat keeps you tossin &apos; and turnin &apos; .  it &apos;s when you wish the sun was bakin &apos; high in the sky so you could see what it is you &apos;re afraid of . 
well ,  don &apos;t say i didn &apos;t warn you when things go your way . 
i don &apos;t care what you believe as long as you leave me alone . 
fine .   i was making time with your girl .  now i &apos;m scared to death and i learned my lesson .  now can you go away ? 
i wasn &apos;t hitting on your girl ! 
i &apos;m doing what any man would do if he &apos;d been offended .   i &apos;m stompin &apos; your ass . 
say ,  what happened to your hand ? 
you &apos;ve got to be -  - 
oh ?  darrell taking good care of you ? 
talk ?   about what ? 
because you &apos;re a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money . 
come to think of it ,  how  &apos;bout some money upfront ? 
that &apos;s a thick change of heart from this afternoon . 
how the hell did you know where the bedroom &apos;s at ? 
hey ,  mister .   you gotta quarter for the juke ? 
you like patsy cline ?   i just love her .  how come ,  i wonder ,  she don &apos;t put out no more new records . 
gee ,  that &apos;s sad .   don &apos;t that make you sad ? 
he &apos;s not my boyfriend .   i mean ,  i let him take me out and stuff ,  but i ain &apos;t spoken for .   not yet that is . 
don &apos;t be afraid of him none .   i don &apos;t care what he does to you ,  we can still be together . 
you harlin ? 
great ! 
just banged my head .   it was an accident . 
what the hell happened to my car ? 
a goddamn radiator hose in a sixty - four - and - a - half mustang .   you know how long it took me to find that hose ? 
two - hundred . 
it &apos;s going to cost you two - hundred dollars . 
what the fuck did you do to my trunk ? 
maybe ,  but if you didn &apos;t i think you would have kept on walking . 
accident . 
you can let go of me now .  i &apos;m safe .  how do they look ? 
you never did answer my question . 
get out of town ,  bobby ,  as quick as you can . 
yeah .  what do you want .  life ,  right ?   have you ever been to california ? 
what do you mean ? 
it takes a key .   he keeps it on himself all the time .   i mean all the time< / u> .   it scratches up against me when we do it . 
i mean it ,  grace .   i &apos;m getting out of here ,  and i want to take you with me . 
you said you couldn &apos;t kill anybody . 
i got the money all packed .   i put the jeep and his caddy in the garage .  people &apos;ll think maybe me and jake went away .   buy us some time .  .  . i know a back road we can take . 
i can &apos;t see it . 
 &quot; arkady &quot;

fenster and hockney ?

my employer wishes to remain anonymous . 
ahh ,  mr .  hockney .  do join us . 
mr .  so -  my employer has made up his mind .  he does not change it . 
no matter .  kill away ,  mr .  mcmanus . 
and i am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions . 
you know a dealer named ruby deemer ,  verbal ? 
you got him wrong . 
he wasn &apos;t behind anything .  it was the lawyer . 
what call ? 
don &apos;t shine me ,  verbal .  no more stalling .  you know what i &apos;m getting at . 
his own people were selling him to a gang of hungarians .  most likely the same hungarians that sate all but wiped out back in turkey .  the money wasn &apos;t there for dope .  the hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger soze for them . 
verbal ,  he left you behind for a reason .  if you all knew soze could find you anywhere ,  why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat ? 
why did he want you to live ?  a one - time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat - cripple ?  no ,  sir .  why &apos;
i don &apos;t buy that reform story for a minute .  and even if i did ,  i certainly don &apos;t believe he would send you to protect her .  so why ? 
i knew him .  he would never  - 
he was accused of jury tampering . 
no  -  -  we don &apos;t want this case in court . 
you were there to help dr .  marx deliver her baby .   were you not ? 
we &apos;ve touched on this ,  his own witness has said .  .  . 
do you know dr .  robert towler .  .  .  ? 
how is that ? 
mr .  concannon .  .  .  ? 
and wasn &apos;t that an oath .  .  .  ?   these are your initials here :   k . c .  when you signed this chart you took an oath .   no less important than that which you took today .    isn &apos;t that right ?    isn &apos;t that right .  .  .  ? 
 .  .  . she went in complaining of stomach cramps .   good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart . 
i have some errands to run ,  and then i thought we &apos;d spend the evening .  .  . 
dr .  thompson .   from your review of the hospital records of may twelfth nineteen seventy - six .   in your opinion ,  what happened to deborah ann kaye ? 
you sure you don &apos;t want me to stay on . 
yes . 
do you know who her doctors were ? 
i &apos;m sure it is ,  frank :   and let me tell you something .   if we find it so complex ,  how in the hell you think you &apos;re going to make a jury understand it ?    see my point ?   let &apos;s talk a minute .  frank :  what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop ? 
galvin ,  look ,  many years ago .  .  . 
nothing further ,  your honor .  .  . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  sir ,  we &apos;re not allowed .  .  . 
hello ,  i &apos;m calling from .  .  . 
i changed my life today .   what did you do ? 
my name &apos;s frank .   and furthermore ,  you came back to see me tonight . 
the weak ,  the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them .  isn &apos;t that the truth ?   you want another drink ? 
is this a bad time . 
you can &apos;t work if you can &apos;t think .  you get in bed .   it &apos;s all right .  i &apos;ll stay here with you .   it &apos;s all right .   come on .  .  . 
what are you going to do ? 
i had an appointment at his office ,  i think i must have got it wrong .  we had a meeting .  .  . 
uh  .  .  . 
are you out of your mind .  .  .  ? 
you need my help .  .  .  ?   you need a goddamn keeper .  .  . are you telling me that you turned down two - hundred -  ten grand ?     huh .  .  .  ?   are you nuts ?   eh ?   are you nuts .  what are you going to do ,  bring her back to life ? 
you  -  -  listen :   you said to me ,  `if not now ,  when .  .  .  &apos;
we &apos;ve got her sister .   testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital .  this is the point . 
they had an obstetrical nurse in there .   we got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse ? 
john :   gimme a cuesta - ray . 
she didn &apos;t do anything .   she took the patient &apos;s history and signed the charts .    &apos;k . c .  &apos;   &apos;kathy costello .  .  .  &apos;
 .  .  .  i understand  .  .  . 
what ? 
hi . 
who told you that ? 
dr .  towler .  .  . 
 .  .  . of the procedures .  .  . 
that frank was working on .   yeah .  he thought franky needed some help ,  so they bribed a juror .   so franky finds out .   he comes to me in tears .  he thinks that anybody who knows what a  &apos;spinnaker &apos; is got to be a saint .   i told him  &apos; franky ,  wake up .   these people are sharks .  what do you think they got so rich from ?   doing good ?  &apos;  he can &apos;t be comforted .   he tells the boys at stearns and harrington they &apos;ve disappointed him ,  he &apos;s going to the judge to rat them out . 
i didn &apos;t know where she was going to lead you . 
no ,  please !  i just want to talk to you ! 
it &apos;s a place to live ,  that &apos;s all . 
i told you !  right here ! 
oh ,  no !  give me time to change and get fixed up ! 
as friends ?  we &apos;d just see a lot of each other as friends ,  and you &apos;d  &quot; take care of me &quot;  ? 
there &apos;s ransohoff &apos;s .  nothing but the best .  come on . 
but i loved the second one she wore .  and this one  -  -    -  -  is beautiful . 
judy ,  it can &apos;t make much difference to you .  i just want to see how you &apos;d look and i know it won &apos;t be the same ,  but  -  - 
judy ,  i want to tell you :  these few days have been the first happy days i &apos;ve had in a year . 
but why ?  why here ? 
and i couldn &apos;t follow her .   god knows i tried .   one doesn &apos;t often get a second chance .  i want to stop being haunted .  you &apos;re my second chances ,  judy . 
why am i here ?  what happened ? 
please drink your coffee . 
no ,  you are right ,   i &apos;m glad you didn &apos;t take me home .  .  .  i wouldn &apos;t have known you ,  to thank you .  .  .   oh ,  but i don &apos;t know you !  and you don &apos;t know me !  my name is madeleine elster . 
i don &apos;t know . 
and no birds sing . 
somewhere in here i was born .  .  .  and here i died and it was only a moment for you .  .  .  you took no notice .  .  . 
there is so little i know .  it is as though i were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored ,  and fragments of mirror still hang there ,  dark and shadowy ,  reflecting a dark image of me .  .  .  and yet not me .  .  .  someone else ,  in other clothes ,  of another time ,  doing things i have never done .  .  .  but still me .  .  .  and i can &apos;t stop to ask why ,  i must keep on walking .  at the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness ,  and i know when i walk into the darkness ,  i &apos;ll die .   but i &apos;ve never come to the and; i &apos;ve always come back ,  before then .  except once . 
what else ? 
of the woman in the mirror .  would you know her if you saw her ? 
where &apos;s your husband ? 
no .  .  .  we &apos;re together .  .  . 
there are things i have to tell you ,  about how we met ,  and why we are together .  but they can wait .  the only important thing now is that i love you and i &apos;m going to keep you safe . 
ow !  ! 
well ,  you know those police department doctors :  no sense of style .   ah ,  tomorrow ! 
midge ,  do you suppose many men wear corsets ? 
not with my acrophobia ,  midge .  if i dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up ,  it could be disastrous ! 
how &apos;s your love life ,  midge ? 
aren &apos;t you ever going to get married ? 
i think i can lick it . 
pop leibel .

i was just playing .  .  . we were playing just playing around . 
i don &apos;t know why the floor was wet ! 
i have plenty of friends . 
one idea that if you had fucking listened to ,  you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars . 
someone goes to walmart ,  gets some buckets ,  brushes ,  mops ,  spic and span ,  the works . 
sun rises at 5 : 52 . 
how do you figure ? 
so that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing . 
we have to get going .

are you solid with that ? 
i tell mine that they &apos;re little men .  i tell them they &apos;re strong .  they make me feel joy .  i let  &apos;em know .  so they really know that i need them just as much .  you know .  just as much man .  and you know ,  you &apos;re their godfather .  .  . 
so .  when is the wedding . 
that &apos;s right . 
keith richards ,  dean martin .  .  . 
he just had two . 
he &apos;s too drunk . 
tony ?  this is keith fisher .  you &apos;re doing my wedding and i &apos;m calling about the chair situation .  yeah ,  i &apos;ll hold . 
that is a load of shit .  personal power has nothing to do with any of this .  tony robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly ,  yes ,  but to give him credit for this ,  for all of this .  .  . well that &apos;s just more than the man deserves . 
micheal ,  now is probably not the best time for this . 
the problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left .  .  . 
negative .  this is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior . 
what ? 
jesus boyd you &apos;re going to o . d .  him . 
this is a situation that defies judgement .  we have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most . 
then what do they have ? 
now if i &apos;m the king of israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it &apos;s just a matter of time  .  .  . right ?  am i right ? 
these rings represent the commitment fisher and liz make to each other on the day .  fisher do you take liz to be your beloved wife ,  to respect ,  honor and cherish till death do you part ? 
this is ridiculous . 
i &apos;m working my ass off here .  i &apos;ve taken care of absolutely everything keith . 
they organized this ,  not me .  i have nothing to do with it . 
how do you figure ? 
he is . 
charles moore for instants . 
i &apos;m not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body . 
do you love me ? 
seating problems . 
keith do not trivialize this . 
go down to the seat place and straighten this out . 
take care of those chairs . 
just a bit of organizing . 
hello . 
how late ? 
this is our honeymoon . 
everything &apos;s ok .  just some more preparations . 
don &apos;t even . 
who &apos;s dead ? 
you fucked a prostitute ? 
you killed a prostitute . 
call the police . 
you left a dead prostitute out in the desert ?  alone ? 
i told boyd two fucking minutes ! 
i &apos;m just so scared of that song .  that fucking ,   &quot; my son just arrived the other day .  .  . he says thanks for the ball ,  come on let &apos;s play .  i got lots of bills come again next day .  he &apos;s grown up just like me .  .  . my boy is just like me .  &quot;  gordon fucking lightfoot ,  cat stevens ,  whoever ,  that song just fucking kills me . 
mike brenn .  yes .  yes .  14 . 3 at 7 . 5 for 6 .  at 29 . 83 at 9 .   i &apos;m amazed the windows don &apos;t blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed ,  ass - puckering rage in these soul - less lizards . 
i don &apos;t care for him . 
where did you get that ? 
i &apos;m thinking about maybe making a move . 
yeah ? 
 .  .  . regression of modern man to his most primitive ,  ape - like state .  .  . 
you see for me it &apos;s over .  over baby .  i &apos;m gonna turn myself in .  after the wedding of course .  after the wedding .  out of respect . 
where &apos;s the camera ? 
what do you mean ? 
sometimes these things happen because of inexperience .  sometimes it &apos;s because of .  .  . 
no ,  uncle; ashes mean penance and death . 
think about it .  don &apos;t hurry .  think it over . 
why don &apos;t you ask her to stay on for a few days ? 
yes ,  yes ,  but there &apos;s no need to bring that up .  how far are you prepared to help me ? 
it &apos;s for wheat .  we &apos;ve always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables . 
it won &apos;t take but a minute .  it &apos;s a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever .  our lady of the helpless granted her a favor . 
so ,  ramona ! 
if you wake first ,  wake me up . 
she isn &apos;t my cousin . 
maybe afterwards he &apos;ll let me  .  .  . 
me ,  rich ?  come on ! 
and this chest ? 
you wouldn &apos;t be here otherwise . 
i don &apos;t know  -  -  they &apos;ve always been there . 
jorge .  you frightened me .  what &apos;s happening to you ? 
well .  .  .  is it so urgent ? 
i don &apos;t understand how you can like being alone so much . 
you won &apos;t get much done with those people .  those times are over !  you ought to let me kick them out . 
yes .  why ? 
how are you today ? 
you cannot leave  .  .  . 
have you repaired the windows of the dormitories ? 
in you go !  moncho ,  lead the way !   you stay here . 
you have decided to leave ,  moncho . 
i don &apos;t want to leave the convent ,  mother . 
i have no desire to see the world again ,  but if you order me to .  .  . 
in english ,  please . 
it was very wellhidden .  there was no way to see it until it was too late . 
you know those cheesy christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year ? 
none .  he could be hiding ,  he could be helping sid ,  or could be in little pieces on santa monica beach .   any idea what sid &apos;s going to do next ? 
ms .  deane ,  you wanted to see me ? 
demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel .  i don &apos;t know where .  .  . 
you &apos;ve had a yearandahalf to make all the adjustments you want ,  lindenmeyer .   ) elizabeth deane does not give second chances .  neither do i .  you &apos;re fired . 
watching your vr people auto reset gave me the idea . 
i told you this would work .  .  by setting back the clocks ,  he has absolutely no idea he &apos;s in virtual reality .  he still thinks he &apos;s in the real world . 
you catching my drift ? 
a little less than yesterday . 
give me your wrist . 
sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next . 
relax .  i know what you meant . 
we know you didn &apos;t kill those guards . 
see something ? 
find out anything ? 
you &apos;ve already fulfilled the terms of your pardon .  you stopped sid 6 . 7 and you &apos;ve got his module .  you &apos;re free to go  right now .   why are you going to do this ? 
where the hell are you going ? 
the symphony of collision .  .  . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  the party you &apos;re trying to reach is not answering .  is there anyone else you would like to talk to ? 
it &apos;s really too bad you have to miss the grand finale .
