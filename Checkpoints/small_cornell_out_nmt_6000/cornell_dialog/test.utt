what ? 
kat !  wake up ! 
you know what they say
i thought you were above all that
hey man .   .   .   you don  &apos; t think i can be  &quot; cool &quot;  ?   you don &apos;t think i can be  &quot; laid back &quot;  like everyone else ? 
i know .   it &apos;d have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila .  you don &apos;t seem like the type . 
i hate him . 
dorsey . 
who ? 
why &apos;d you let him get to you ? 
just let me sit down . 
see that ?   who needs affection when i &apos;ve got blind hatred ? 
like you could find one
because then i &apos;d have to start taking out girls who like me . 
why ? 
sure ,  i do
you don &apos;t care if i die
i told you
why  &apos;re you doing this ? 
leave it to you to use big words when you &apos;re shitfaced . 
this is so patronizing . 
what if you have a concussion ?  my dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable .  not that i could tell the difference .  .  . 
i know ,  just let me sleep
uh ,  uh .  you lie down and you &apos;ll go to sleep
i just need to lie down for awhile
you &apos;re not okay . 
i &apos;m fine .  i &apos;m
okay ? 
funny ,  you &apos;re the only one
i say ,  do what you wanna do . 
 &quot; i &apos;m getting trashed ,  man .  &quot;  isn &apos;t that what you &apos;re supposed to do at a party ? 
what &apos;s this ? 
why ,  don &apos;t you ? 
you know who the raincoats are ? 
you know ,  these guys are no bikini kill or the raincoats ,  but they &apos;re right up there . 
do you mind ?   you &apos;re sort of ruining it for me . 
that &apos;s what you want ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
excuse me ? 
hey .   great show ,  huh ? 
depends on the topic .  my fenders don &apos;t really whip me into a verbal frenzy . 
you &apos;re not a big talker ,  are you ? 
hi
i was in the laundromat .  i saw your car .  thought i &apos;d say hi . 
are you following me ? 
seven - thirty ? 
you  -  -  covered in my vomit . 
come on  -  -  the ponies ,  the flat beer ,  you with money in your eyes ,  me with my hand on your ass .  .  . 
and why would i do that ? 
then say you &apos;ll spend dollar night at the track with me . 
i don &apos;t really think you warrant that strong an emotion . 
you hate me don &apos;t you ? 
i know a lot more than that
like where ?   the 7 - eleven on burnside ?  do you even know my name ,  screwboy ? 
the night i take you to places you &apos;ve never been before .   and back . 
oh ,  right .   friday . 
pick you up friday ,  then
my mission in life . 
there &apos;s a way to get a guy &apos;s attention . 
sweating like a pig ,  actually .   and yourself ? 
i mean wo - man .   how ya doin &apos; ? 
oh ,  christ .   don &apos;t tell me you &apos;ve changed your mind .   i already sent  &apos;em a check . 
when i go ? 
you know ,  fathers don &apos;t like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives .   it means we &apos;ve become spectators .   bianca still lets me play a few innings .   you &apos;ve had me on the bleachers for years .   when you go to sarah lawrence ,  i won &apos;t even be able to watch the game . 
no  -  -  impressed . 
what &apos;s the matter ?   upset that i rubbed off on her ? 
bianca did what ? 
the part where bianca beat the hell out of some guy . 
which parts ? 
parts of it . 
so tell me about this dance .  was it fun ? 
no ,  daddy . 
i don &apos;t understand the allure of dehydrated food .   is this something i should be hip to ? 
funny . 
yeah .   she left with some bikers big ones .   full of sperm . 
was that your sister ? 
i want to go to an east coast school !  i want you to trust me to make my own choices .   i want  -  - 
you &apos;re eighteen .   you don &apos;t know what you want .   you won &apos;t know until you &apos;re forty - five and you don &apos;t have it . 
so what i want doesn &apos;t matter ? 
as a parent ,  that &apos;s my right
because you &apos;re making decisions for me . 
why can &apos;t we agree on this ? 
i thought you were punishing me . 
is this about sarah lawrence ?  you punishing me ? 
then tell them i had a seizure . 
my insurance does not cover pms
enough ! 
this from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips ? 
you decided . 
i thought we decided you were going to school here .   at u of 0 . 
i know . 
just smack her now . 
am i supposed to feel better ?  like ,  right now ?   or do i have some time to think about it ? 
no  .  .  .  i believe  &quot; heinous bitch &quot;  is the term used most often . 
tempestuous ? 
the point is kat  -  -  people perceive you as somewhat  .  .  . 
i still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls .   i was merely a spectator . 
well ,  yes ,  compared to your other choices of expression this year ,  today &apos;s events are quite mild .   by the way ,  bobby rictor &apos;s gonad retrieval operation went quite well ,  in case you &apos;re interested . 
expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action . 
katarina stratford .   my ,  my .   you &apos;ve been terrorizing ms .  blaise again . 
yeah .  .  . 
kat a fan ,  too ? 
right . 
macbeth ,  right ? 
oh yeah . 
you think ? 
yeah .   i guess . 
cool pictures .   you a fan ? 
hi . 
hey there .   tired of breathing ? 
man  -  -  don &apos;t say shit like that to  me .  people can hear you . 
sweet love ,  renew thy force ! 
you were right .  she &apos;s still pissed . 
no  -  i &apos;ve got a sweet - payin &apos; job that i &apos;m about to lose . 
so you got cozy with she who stings ? 
i &apos;m likin &apos; you guys better
i prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows . 
yeah . 
ever been to club skunk ? 
just for now . 
are you telling me i &apos;m a  -    &quot; non - smoker &quot;  ? 
good enough . 
what ?  ! 
we &apos;re your guys . 
you two are gonna help me tame the wild beast ? 
patrick ,  pat ,  you &apos;re not looking at the big picture .   joey &apos;s just a pawn .  we set this whole thing up so cameron can get the girl . 
so dorsey can get the girl ? 
that &apos;s where we can help you .   with kat . 
dorsey can plow whoever he wants .  i &apos;m just in this for the cash . 
i think i speak correctly when i say that cameron &apos;s love is pure .   purer than say  -  -  joey dorsey &apos;s . 
what is it with this chick ?   she have three tits ? 
the situation is ,  my man cameron here has a major jones for bianca stratford . 
what plan ? 
whatever the hell it is you &apos;re standin &apos; there waitin &apos; to say . 
what ? 
say it
see you next week ! 
you &apos;re completely demented . 
well ,  you know  -  -  there &apos;s the prestige of the job title .  .  .  and the benefits package is pretty good .  .  . 
you weren &apos;t abused ,  you aren &apos;t stupid ,  and as far as i can tell ,  you &apos;re only slightly psychotic  -  -  so why is it that you &apos;re such a fuck - up ? 
what &apos;s to discuss ? 
why don &apos;t we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid ? 
i &apos;m at a loss ,  then .   what should we talk about ?  your year of absence ? 
touch of the flu . 
i don &apos;t understand ,  patrick .   you haven &apos;t done anything asinine this week .  are you not feeling well ? 
with the teeth of your zipper ? 
it was a bratwurst .   i was eating lunch . 
it says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls . 
i missed you . 
that  &apos; s what i thought
absolutely not . 
did i have anything to say about it ? 
your daughters went to the prom . 
what just happened ? 
but  -  -  who  -  -  what  -  -  ? 
have a great time ,  honey ! 
dr .  ruth ? 
what do you wanna watch ?   we &apos;ve got crap ,  crap ,  crap or crap
kissing ?   is that what you think happens ?   kissing isn &apos;t what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day . 
they &apos;ll dance ,  they &apos;ll kiss ,  they &apos;ll come home .   let her go . 
pirate  -  -  no question . 
would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a british rear admiral ? 
you &apos;re not helping . 
tumescent ! 
jesus !   can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating ? 
sarah lawrence is on the other side of the country . 
what &apos;s a synonym for throbbing ? 
make anyone cry today ? 
in the microwave . 
can &apos;t be that far ,  i say .   also ,  i don &apos;t like the smell of the sea around here .   smells like a cunt .  bad sign .  .  . 
we left three weeks ago ,  alonso .  can &apos;t be that near . 
we should have seen land . 
we &apos;ll all go crazy .  .  . 
he &apos;s the devil &apos;s child .  .  . 
with a face like that ?   i don &apos;t want you looking at me .   you hear ? 
ah ,  leave him alone .   he &apos;s doing no harm . 
what are you listening to ,  chicken ass ? 
you &apos;ll be drinking your own piss .  .  .  for the glory of spain .  .  .  and admiral colon .  .  .  !   bastard ! 
the water &apos;s going putrid in the barrels . 
i never seen heat like this !   not even in las minas ! 
if - god - wills - it ! 
asia can be found to the west  -  -  and i will prove it . 
blind faith is what i consider heresy ! 
don &apos;t you realize your words could be considered heretical ? 
did he not choose a carpenter &apos;s son to reveal himself to the world ? 
if god intended our proximity to asia ,  do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world ? 
no .   the portuguese have already discovered black - skinned people .   i ,  too ,  will find other populations  -  -  and bring them to the word of god . 
is that all that interests you ?  gold ? 
trade ,  your excellency .   according to marco polo ,  the kingdom of china is one of the richest of the world .  even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold . 
if they agree to follow me ,  yes . 
your life ,  and that of others ! 
your eminence ,  there is only one way to settle the matter .   and that is to make the journey .   i am ready to risk my life to prove it possible . 
excellency ,  you are right . 
senor colon ,  an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew .   i am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment . 
then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations ,  the circumference of the earth is approximately .  .  .   22 , 000 leagues or more .   which makes the ocean .  .  .  uncrossable . 
i am ,  your eminence
unfortunately ,  don colon ,  that is precisely where our opinions differ .  .  .   are you familiar with the work of aristotle ?   erathostene ?   ptolemeus ? 
yes ,  your eminence .   the voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks . 
you say asia can be found by sailing west ? 
a waste .  .  .  ?   let me tell you something ,  arojaz .   if your name ,  or mine ,  is ever remembered  -  -  it will only be because of his . 
what a tragedy .  .  .  what a waste of a life .  .  . 
you can see for yourself . 
on the contrary ,  your eminence .   it seems to me the man is preparing his own cross . 
it won &apos;t be easy to get rid of your prophet now ,  don sanchez . 
indeed .   the world is full of mercenaries  -  -  and states often make use of them ,  when it benefits them .   my only concern is the welfare and prosperity of spain . 
he is a mercenary !   did he not already try to convince the king of portugal of his absurd notions ? 
naturally .   but i would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for spain for a .  .  .  dispute over a point of geography . 
the judgment is ours ! 
the state has some reason to be interested in this man &apos;s proposition ,  your eminence .  .  . 
i can &apos;t keep my eyes off you .   i would like to catch up with all the moments i didn &apos;t spend with you . 
what is it ,  now ?   tell me .  .  . 
i am busy inside . 
can &apos;t you stay with us a little ? 
not everything .  .  .  do you think i care ?   i &apos;m a free man again .   riches don &apos;t make a man rich ,  they only make him busier .  .  . 
they took everything .  .  . 
they tried .  .  .  but i didn &apos;t let them . 
god .  .  .  you &apos;re so beautiful !   i can &apos;t believe no other man has ever taken you away from me .  .  . 
i can arrange for the queen to take fernando and diego into her service . 
you don &apos;t usually ask . 
beatrix ,  i want to ask you something . 
that &apos;s something you can &apos;t decide . 
i don &apos;t want you to wait for me . 
i &apos;m not asking you to swear to anything . 
thank god .  .  . 
she said yes . 
i find that hard to believe . 
perhaps i was never meant to live with a woman .  .  . 
i &apos;d love to argue with you sometimes .   but you &apos;re never here ! 
are we going to argue ? 
well .  .  .  that &apos;s true .   i have a child by a man who won &apos;t marry me !   who &apos;s always leaving .  .  . 
i haven &apos;t given you much of a life . 
i know . 
i could be gone for years . 
i am afraid this is not the worst news . 
how could i be ?   the mainland has been found .   exactly as i said it would . 
i am not a seaman .   but i heard it is no more than a week at sea .   i hope you are not too disappointed . 
how far from here ? 
congratulations .   then i am free to search for the mainland . 
viceroy of the west indies . 
appointment to what ? 
my letters of appointment . 
yes .  .  .  i remember .  .  . 
don alonso de bobadilla . 
bartolome and giacomo colon . 
may i ask by whom ? 
forgive me ,  don bobadilla  -  -  those positions have already been taken . 
i understand that you will soon be appointing governors for the islands ?   is it not so ? 
tell me the first thing that comes to your mind . 
really ?   god .  .  .  i wouldn &apos;t know where to start .  .  .  and yet .  .  . 
i want you to tell me everything you remember ,  father .   from the beginning .   everything . 
he never had one .  .  .  except aboard my ships ! 
he asks when he can come to visit you .   he left his address . 
what does he say ? 
i am not listening ,  father .   but i can &apos;t help hearing . 
what are you listening to ? 
there must be a passage to that other ocean . 
father .  .  . 
not bad . 
how are you feeling ,  fernando ? 
this time with me ! 
i have to explore the mainland . 
yes .  .  .  yes ,  i do .  .  .  on all of them ! 
do you swear on all the holy saints in heaven ? 
you promise ?   do you swear on st .  christopher .  .  .  ? 
there &apos;ll be a time . 
i want to go with you ! 
all of them created by people like me . 
roofs .  .  .  towers ,  palaces .  .  .  spires .  .  . 
what do you see ? 
look out of that window . 
i am not afraid of you .   you are nothing but a dreamer . 
call them . 
all i have to do is call the guards . 
to rise so high ,  in so short a time ,  is a dangerous occupation .   a little hypocrisy goes a long way . 
what .  .  .  ?   do i have so many already ? 
you seem to have a special talent for making friends . 
good !   we are also in need of judges .   except there are no thieves ! 
don bobadilla is already a judge ,  my dear don cristobal . 
but we do have a lack of notaries .  you should contact my administration . 
 .  .  .  for a commoner ? 
you defend yourself admirably .  .  . 
forgive me ,  don colon .   but what about gold ? 
they don &apos;t see sin in their nakedness .   they live according to nature ,  in a never ending summer .  the islands are covered with trees ,  filled with blossoms and fruits .  and .  .  . 
if you won &apos;t accept our proposal ,  we &apos;ll simply find someone who will . 
and were you never ambitious ,  excellency ?   or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles ,  a fault for the rest of us ? 
then you are too ambitious . 
i &apos;m not bargaining ! 
i remind you ,  senor colon ,  that you are in no position to bargain with me . 
no .  .  .  !   i have waited too long ,  fought too hard .   now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit !   no .  .  .  i will not be your servant ! 
no ? 
no .  .  . 
you never learned how to speak my language . 
utapan ,  won &apos;t you speak to me ?   you used to know how to speak to me . 
you did the same to your god ! 
you have to find them ,  utapan .   look what they did ! 
ask him if he will help . 
he understands . 
we will work with his people .   we want peace .   ask the chief if he understands ? 
he has medicine .   tell him we admire his people . 
chief says .  .  . 
 .  .  .  and also to bring medicine . 
chief says  -  -  he has a god . 
to bring the word of god . 
why ? 
thousands . 
chief says  -  -  how many ? 
tell him his country is very beautiful .   tell him we are leaving men here  -  -  to build a fort . 
chief knows . 
tell the chief we thank him . 
you come !   you speak first ! 
island .   far . 
what is it ?   a tribe ?   an island ? 
say not here !   cuba ! 
i don &apos;t know .  .  .  i have the impression that i didn &apos;t change that much .   i still can &apos;t accept the world as it is ! 
oh ?   so you are a new man ? 
new worlds create new people . 
i knew you would . 
i have to disagree . 
you &apos;ll always be older than me ,  father . 
i suppose we &apos;re both old men now . 
give me absolution . 
i believed in you .  .  . 
you are bound by an oath ,  father . 
my son ,  my son .  .  .   your certitudes are sometimes frightening .  .  .   christopher ,  you must speak to them .  and if you don &apos;t i will . 
if i tell them ,  they won &apos;t follow me .   you know that i am right ,  father .   you trust me .  .  . 
may god forgive you .  .  .  !   you must tell them !   you must tell your men ! 
i am not sure .  .  .  it could be twice the distance . 
how long ? 
i lied .   the journey will be longer than i said . 
what are you saying ? 
father ,  i have betrayed my family .  i betrayed my men .   and i betrayed you . 
i am listening ,  my son . 
forgive me ,  father .   for i have sinned . 
in nomine patris et filius ,  et spiritus sancti . 
colon !   don &apos;t ! 
all of them !   just lies ! 
damn all of you !   you all set up theories based on what ?   you never leave the safety of your studies !  go out !   find out what the world is about and then tell me something i can listen to ! 
colon ! 
damn god ! 
if god intends you to go ,  then you will go . 
wait !   i &apos;ve waited seven years already !   how much longer do you want me to wait ? 
you mustn &apos;t give way to despair .  you must wait . 
only god knows the meaning of such words ,  my son . 
i &apos;ve been contradicted all my life .  .  .  eternity ! 
you get so carried away when you are being contradicted ! 
passion is something one cannot control ! 
father marchena ! 
i &apos;ll try to remember that ,  marchena .  .  . 
two minutes .  .  .  and already you &apos;re a dead man .   don &apos;t let passion overwhelm you ,  colon . 
so was christ ! 
esdras is a jew . 
the calculations of toscanelli marin de tyr ,  esdras .  .  . 
how can you be so certain ? 
ignorance !   i believe the indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the canary islands . 
how can you be so certain ?   the ocean is said to be infinite . 
to open a new route to asia .   at the moment there are only two ways of reaching it .  .  . 
why do you wish to sail west ? 
with some difficulty .   i had to promise them you were not a total fool . 
how did you manage it ? 
that &apos;s what it says . 
god .  .  .  that &apos;s in a week ! 
father ,  i am doing what i think is the best for him .   and he has the teacher i would have chosen for myself . 
diego is a bright boy  -  -  a pleasure to teach  -  -  but so serious .  .  .  brothers should be raised together ,  colon .   even brothers from different mothers .  .  . 
your majesty  -  -  some men are content to read about things .   i must see them with my own eyes .   i cannot be other than i am . 
there is one thing i &apos;d like to understand .  .  .  why do you want to go back ,  after all this ? 
thank you . 
but without your brothers .   nor are you to return to santo domingo or any of the other colonies .   you may explore the continent . 
they come and go as naked as the day god created them .  .  . 
do they have such thoughts ? 
thirty seven ,  your majesty .  .  .  and you ? 
how old are you ,  senor colon ? 
a woman ? 
i know what i see .   i see someone who doesn &apos;t accept the world as it is .   who &apos;s not afraid .   i see a women who thinks .  .  .   &quot; what if ?  &quot;  .  .  . 
you show no inclination to speak otherwise ! 
may i speak freely ? 
surely you can do anything you want . 
i cannot ignore the verdict of my council . 
that she was impregnable . 
what did they say about granada before today ? 
the ocean is uncrossable ? 
no more than the woman who said she would take granada from the moors . 
i should not even be listening to you ,  since my council said no .   but santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity .  .  .  and sanchez ,  that you are not a fool . 
you will regret this . 
you &apos;ll be held in detention ,  deprived of your privileges and possessions .   until you are returned to spain where you will be judged .  have you anything to say ? 
savagery is what monkeys understand . 
in one act of brutality ,  you have created chaos .   tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us !   all that because of your criminal savagery ! 
you did not hear me ,  don colon .   not my horse . 
don moxica  -  -  we all have to work . 
my horse doesn &apos;t work . 
we can &apos;t raise the wheel without it . 
we came here to stay !   to build !  not to start a crusade .   in this forest ,  there is enough danger to sweep us away in days !   so we will be brave and swallow our grief .   and in the name of those who died ,  we will accomplish what we came for . 
we don &apos;t need to know . 
you want a war ?   fine .   we are a thousand .   they outnumber us by ten !  who will you kill ?   which tribe ? 
if you want to keep your head on your shoulders ,  you &apos;ll do as i say . 
we lost cousins ,  friends .   we will wash this in blood . 
the indians have no such word ,  don moxica . 
and you say this is an indian vice ?  by god !   i don &apos;t see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin . 
we can &apos;t be . 
he &apos;s drawing an isthmus .  .  .  he &apos;s saying we &apos;re on an isthmus . 
what &apos;s he doing ? 
twenty eight . 
what do you read ? 
come over here . 
well ,  i surely know what a quadrant is !   but i &apos;ve never seen it used at night before . 
and what do you think mendez ? 
well .  .  .  it &apos;s the men ,  sir .   they wonder how you know our position .  we &apos;ve lost sight from land days ago .  .  . 
god be with us admiral . 
due west ,  captain mendez .   and may god be with us .  .  . 
you &apos;re right .   let the men decide . 
you tell that to them ! 
pinzon ,  pinzon .  .  .  all we can do now is go forward !   think about that ! 
you bloody .  .  . 
you never did .   you did all the talking for both of us ,  remember ? 
jesus maria !   i should have never listened to you ! 
and then what ?   half of the water has gone ,  the rest is nearly putrid !  you know that ! 
you don &apos;t know anything !   listen colon ,  these are my ships ,  right ?  so i &apos;m telling you we &apos;re turning back ! 
the land is there .   i know it ! 
we &apos;re lost ! 
you think i don &apos;t know that ? 
we &apos;re on the verge of a mutiny ,  colon ! 
we have to keep the hopes of these men alive ! 
you must be mad .  .  .  ! 
six days ago ,  yes . 
you lied !   you cheated !   we &apos;re way past 750 leagues ! 
immediately . 
where can i meet this man ? 
because he is not afraid of me . 
then why ? 
i know ,  i should not tolerate his impertinence . 
and who would you think of ,  for such a task ? 
he must be replaced . 
then ,  what do you suggest ,  don sanchez ? 
is this true ,  brother buyl ? 
 .  .  .  but there is worse .   he ordered the execution of five members of the nobility .  .  . 
we weren &apos;t expecting immediate profits ,  were we ?   we must have faith .   we must give time for time . 
every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying .   but with no gold !  the new world proves expensive ,  your majesty . 
yes .   it would be a pity ,  wouldn &apos;t it ?   call him back ! 
 .  .  .  into a monk .  .  . 
never ,  your majesty .   although .  .  . 
you were right ,  don sanchez .  .  .  his demands could never be granted . 
yes ,  your majesty . 
is that the man i knew ,  treasurer sanchez ? 
officers ,  there &apos;s your killer ,  do your duty ,  arrest him ! 
 .  .  . so we kill someone famous and if we are caught ,  we are sent to mental hospital .  .  .
