you better get packed . 
i &apos;m glad i met you . 
no matter what happens .  .  . i &apos;m glad i met you . 
a good immigration lawyer could stall the process .   eddie recommended one . 
if you were my boyfriend ,  i &apos;d suggest you find another girlfriend that isn &apos;t going to jail ten - thousand miles away . 
if i was your boyfriend ,  i might be . 
ludwig ?   he &apos;s gay  -  are you jealous ? 
is he your boyfriend ? 
i &apos;m sorry . 
i still can &apos;t believe eddie &apos;s gone . 
are you alright ? 
i &apos;m sorry .   i didn &apos;t mean to .  .  . i &apos;m glad .  actually i &apos;m glad it &apos;s over .   all this time .   hiding .   never being able to look anyone in the eyes .  always afraid that someone would find out who i was .   never trusting anyone .  .  . 
they &apos;re not gonna send you right back . 
you don &apos;t know .   i &apos;m sorry .   i was desperate .   that &apos;s not me .   i shot a cop .   can you imagine what they &apos;ll do to me when i got to prison ? 
i know . 
i &apos;m not a whore .   i &apos;m not a whore . 
i &apos;m just trying to find out who you are . 
what are you asking me ? 
so you were never a prostitute ? 
i came here .   i had no money .   i knew no one .   i couldn &apos;t get a job because you have to have a green card to get work .  they approached me  -  i could &apos;ve made a lot of money .   i considered it ,  but .  .  .  it &apos;s not who i am .   they pay me below the table at ludwig &apos;s . 
no . 
what about back home ? 
no . 
did you ever turn tricks before ? 
yes ,  i considered it . 
you considered becoming a prostitute ? 
yeah .   this way . 
so .  .  . the station is empty ? 
the men are out of quarters  -  practicing putting out fires . 
somewhere else ? 
i can &apos;t take you to my place . 
do you live alone ?   i &apos;ve been in these clothes since .  .  . the killings .   could we stop at your place ?  i could take a shower .  .  . before i go into custody ? 
divorced . 
are you married ? 
they won &apos;t until this is over . 
i will if they don &apos;t send me back . 
if you cooperate with the da  -  maybe they &apos;ll help you with your situation . 
now i become custody of police department ? 
yes ,  but he was a cop . 
alright .   that &apos;s a justifiable homicide . 
 .  .  . my little sister and i shared a flat  -  i came home one night and a man was raping her .   his gun was on the chair .  .  .  he came at me and i shot him . 
you &apos;re a cop  -  you &apos;ll never believe me . 
look ,  we can help you but right now we have to deal with what &apos;s happening here .  tell us the truth .  .  . is that the truth ? 
i &apos;m from a small town in slovakia .   like the south here .   the police is right ,  a civilian is wrong .   so i fled . 
a cop ? 
no ,  no ,  don &apos;t talk to immigration ! 
are you here illegally ?   don &apos;t worry about that .   we &apos;ll talk to immigration .  they won &apos;t deport you . 
arrest you for what ?   why would we arrest you ? 
if i tell you ,  will you arrest me ? 
whether you tell us or not ,  we &apos;ll find out .   better if it comes from you . 
go on . 
tamina was a friend of mine .   my shower was broken ,  she let me use theirs . 
c &apos;mon ,  start at the beginning .   you know these people ? 
i told your partner ,  i can &apos;t help .   i didn &apos;t see anything . 
yeah ,  sure .   beep me when you &apos;re ready for the press conference . 
i &apos;m ready to be briefed .   excuse us . 
oh yeah .  .  .  ?   alright . 
look ,  after jordy briefs me ,  you can do the press conference .   how about that ?  the case is all yours . 
well ,  i &apos;m the deputy chief fire marshall and every now and then i &apos;d like to be included in decisions . 
it was my decision ,  not his . 
oh . 
there &apos;s nothing to talk about .   get a good lawyer .   you &apos;re suspended until your trial . 
but chief ?   over this ?  ? 
how are you going to fight this ?   maybe if oleg hadn &apos;t gotten away and you &apos;d been on the front page ,  as a hero ,  this thing would be easier to fight .   you &apos;d have the good to weight against the bad !  it &apos;s unfortunate that i have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there &apos;s nothing i can do !   gimme your shield . 
end my career ? 
well this is gonna end your career and probably mine . 
chief  -  i know i screwed up  -  but this guy was no innocent civilian . 
forgot ?   you handcuffed a civilian to a tree ?  ! 
what was i supposed to do ?   the guy tried to mug me .   i was gonna send a cop back  -  i just forgot . 
the public doesn &apos;t have any idea what we do and now you &apos;re going to define our image !   this is going to be our rodney king ! 
okay .   but not water sports . 
chief  -  mind if i take her ? 
oh really .   that &apos;s nice .   you took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot ?   are you out of your fucking mind ?  ?   are you having that much trouble gettin &apos; dates ?  ! 
no !   nothing happened . 
a shower !  ?   did you take one ,  too ? 
i let her take a shower . 
what do you mean ,   &apos;cleaned up ?  &apos;
ladder 20 was on the rock for training .  we stopped there .  .  .  so she could get cleaned up . 
i came to see how the investigation was going .   i called and you &apos;re not here .   i wait up at the station and you don &apos;t even show up !  !  !   i beep you  -  you don &apos;t return my call .   where the hell have you been ?  ! 
hey ,  chief ,  what are you doing here ? 
 &apos;cause we got more important things to do ,  like finding out who did it . 
then why didn &apos;t you talk to the reporter ? 
who do you think ,  chief ?  ! 
who did cause and origin ? 
yeah . 
alright .   swing by her apartment .   let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to hoover street .   you got that ? 
yeah .   he finished awhile ago . 
did the d . a .  videotape her deposition ? 
you do that ,  wiseguy .   now let &apos;s solve this thing before eddie flemming does . 
i said ,  yeah ,  you &apos;re right ,  chief .   as soon as we get somethin &apos; we &apos;ll let you alert the media . 
what was that ,  korfin ? 
yeah ,  right . 
don &apos;t you guys understand ?   it &apos;s all about image .   the better we look the more money i get to pay you guys overtime . 
i know .   relax .   take it easy .   don &apos;t worry ,  we &apos;ll get those fuckers . 
he got my gun !   motherfucker was filming the whole time ! 
no .   i &apos;m okay . 
are you hit ? 
stay with her . 
the other side of the street .   the guy with the videocamera .   don &apos;t look  -  put her in the car .   stay this side . 
c &apos;mere .   you wanna go to homicide school ?   here  -  make yourself useful . 
yeah . 
only one guys checked in ? 
it &apos;s okay . 
sorry .  .  . pd only . 
still unknown but we &apos;re running prints .  kid over there caught the case .

takin &apos; a bath . 
where is she ? 
a timer . 
what &apos;s he looking for ? 
you ready ? 
tomorrow .   at lunch . 
when ? 
i &apos;m gonna propose . 
what &apos;s the kid gonna say  -  sorry ?  meanwhile i &apos;m not here anymore .  like last week  -  we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up  -  spleen here  -  liver there  -  his heart in a pan .  six hours ago this guy was walkin &apos; his dog or buyin &apos; a quart of milk .   who knows ?   but some kid &apos;s robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can &apos;t tell if he &apos;s a piece of beef or a human being and i &apos;m thinkin &apos; that &apos;s me .  sooner or later .   that &apos;s me . 
it was freaky ,  i &apos;ll tell you .   stupid kid . 
maybe you could just put in a shot of martell ? 
vodka tonic . 
coffee for me ,  i gotta slow down . 
she washes hair up at ludwig &apos;s  -  a salon on 63rd and madison . 
he had a videocamera ?   where is she ?  quickly ! 
tall ,  short - haired ,  scary eyes .   second guy with him was .  .  . shorter ,  with a wrestler &apos;s build .   and he wouldn &apos;t turn his videocamera off me . 
describe him . 
he said he was her cousin .   i told him where she works .   they were just here . 
daphne .   another guy came in asking me about her ,  too . 
what are you saying ? 
boy ,  she &apos;s so popular all the sudden . 
did you tell him you did ? 
no . 
do you have any czech girls working for you ? 
yeah .   he wanted a girl from czechoslovakia ,  but i sent him honey  &apos;cause once they get there ,  you know ,  it doesn &apos;t really matter  -  honey was killed .  .  .  ?   poor girl .  .  . 
oh my g - d .   honey !   honey &apos;s dead ? 
we don &apos;t have her i . d .  yet ,  but one of your girls was killed last night at the king edward hotel . 
what &apos;s wrong ? 
homicide ,  miss hearn .   it &apos;s detective eddie flemming .   open up . 
i have nothin &apos; to say .   if you wanna contact my attorney .  .  . 
police .   we &apos;d like to ask you a few questions . 
who &apos;s there ? 
you know ,  i don &apos;t know .   i like you .  you remind me of a puppy i used to have .  he pissed on the rug all the time ,  but i still kept him . 
why &apos;d you help me back there with the chief ?   why &apos;d you stand up for me like that ? 
how you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an immigration lawyer .   here ,  here &apos;s a number of an immigration lawyer .   that &apos;s how you help her .  but you can &apos;t get involved in her like that .   you &apos;re gonna jeopardize your career ,  your life and you &apos;re gonna jeopardize my case .   and lemme give you another piece of advice .   maybe you don &apos;t watch tv but i &apos;ll let you in on a little secret  -  the whole fuckin &apos; world watches television .   and when you get out there ,  they know your face .   and the little fame ,  the little fuckin &apos; itty bitty fame that i get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job .   and i get more done because of it . 
but ,  i mean ,  didn &apos;t you ever go out on a limb for somebody ?   i mean ,  you shoulda heard her there .   tellin &apos; her whole story .  .  . i believed her . 
well ,  it &apos;s not up to you to decide whether she &apos;s innocent or not .   don &apos;t you understand ,  that &apos;s why you &apos;re a professional . 
i told you ,  you know ,  i thought i was doing the right thing ,  you know ,  i think she &apos;s innocent . 
no ,  i don &apos;t think you were a fool ,  i just think you were stupid about it .   i mean ,  to say the least ,  you outta know better .   you don &apos;t know her well enough .  she &apos;s got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her ,  it &apos;s fuckin &apos; over .   you can deny it all you want ,  but it will not make one fucking bit of difference .  you &apos;re dead . 
yeah ,  just her in the shower .   nothing happened .   look ,  i &apos;m sure you probably think i &apos;m a fool and i fucked up ,  but .  .  . 
just a shower ? 
i took her there for a shower and that &apos;s it . 
well ,  you shoulda because nobody &apos;s gonna believe you didn &apos;t .  .  . including me . 
look ,  eddie ,  i &apos;m tellin &apos; you  -  i didn &apos;t touch her . 
women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs . 
hey .   i &apos;m a professional . 
okay ,  tell you what ,  i &apos;ll give you a head start .   you take her to the station house .   don &apos;t let her out of your sight .  she &apos;s the only warm body we got left . 
you know what i &apos;m saying here . 
you &apos;re her savior ?   is she the kid you &apos;re gonna save from the burning building ? 
c &apos;mon .   you intimidate her  &apos;cause you &apos;re a celebrity .   she sees me differently . 
so am i . 
i &apos;m serious here . 
my point exactly . 
i don &apos;t have a girlfriend . 
what would your girlfriend think of that ? 
yeah . 
you wanna talk to her alone ? 
look  -  let me talk to her .   any leads i get ,  they &apos;re all yours .   just let me have a first crack at her . 
raw deal . 
she &apos;s fucked .   even if that story is true . 
something back home ? 
why not ? 
is that all there is ? 
she just saw two of her friends killed !  they probably threatened her . 
what are you hiding ?   why are you afraid
then i guess we &apos;re doin &apos; this the right way ,  aren &apos;t we ?   if we pull up to a burning building i &apos;ll gladly let you go first . 
i wanted to run up to a building on fire ,  kick in the door ,  rush into the smoke and save a kid . 
hey !   i always wanted to be a cop when i was a kid .   i dreamed of running up to a door ,  kicking it in ,  pulling my gun and yelling  &apos;freeze !  &apos; at the bad guy !  what &apos;d you dream about ? 
of course . 
so am i .   alright ,  i &apos;ll go inside and you cover the back . 
i &apos;m on duty . 
you thirsty ? 
i &apos;m on my way with eddie .   ludwig &apos;s .  63rd and madison .   the suspects might be there already . 
leon  -  meet us at 63rd and madison .  hair salon .   ludwig &apos;s . 
better than one . 
two heads . 
i &apos;ll call it .  .  .  tails . 
tell you what  -  i &apos;ll flip you a coin .  if you win you can come with me .   if you don &apos;t win ,  you don &apos;t come . 
this is ridiculous .   i &apos;m not gonna be in your way  -  we can talk the case over . 
i &apos;ll let you know what happens . 
but what if it does ?   you might need my help . 
this has nothing to do with your fire . 
mind if i ride along with you ? 
you got any better ideas ? 
you goin &apos; to the escort service ? 
stay here . 
my folks are . 
you &apos;re polish ? 
my parents are from poland .   i can help with the eastern european angle . 
this isn &apos;t homicide school . 
i can watch you ,  eddie .   maybe i &apos;ll learn something . 
there wasn &apos;t a fire .   there &apos;ll be nothing for you to do . 
i &apos;ll come with you . 
or czechoslovakia .   the slavs have been fighting the germans and the russians for a thousand years .   these are very intense people and they take things personally . 
eastern europe .   like what ?   romania ?  hungary ? 
maybe it &apos;s a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message .   burial rites are taken very seriously in eastern europe .   it could be to humiliate them .  just burning them up ,  no proper funeral ,  it &apos;s like condemning them to hell . 
look ,  i &apos;m not even sure she has anything to do with this .   i saw her outside after the fire  -  thought it was a lead .  maybe she saw something .   maybe she was visiting somebody here .   who knows ? 
what would you call her ? 
who says she &apos;s a suspect ? 
maybe you don &apos;t care about that either .   prettiest suspect i &apos;ve had in awhile . 
hmmmm . 
pretty . 
the super said he &apos;d seen her before but she didn &apos;t live here . 
you were right ,  they were both dead before the fire .   the male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine .   that &apos;s usually an indicator of something personal . 
if you found me steppin &apos; on your crime scene  -  it might piss you off ,  too .   what about the report ? 
sure .   but i would like to ask you something .   you got a problem with me ? 
did you get a report from the m . e .  ? 
good .   good .   commendable . 
i don &apos;t even watch tv . 
nah ,  why should you ? 
well ,  just so you know ,  i don &apos;t care about that stuff . 
well ,  just so you know .   i gave you guys the credit . 
nah ,  i musta missed it . 
watch the news ? 
it &apos;s your crime scene now .   you can do what you want . 
why don &apos;t you explain it ,  bobby .   hey camello !   you mind punching a hole in the floor ? 
no ,  what is it ? 
you know what that is ,  right ? 
no ,  we don &apos;t mind .   you mind leon ? 
hey ,  that &apos;s great you guys got it all wrapped up ,  but you don &apos;t mind if we go through the routine ?   it gives us somethin &apos; to do . 
smarter than americans .   you &apos;re fed cry baby talk shows all day long .   not only will americans believe me ,  they &apos;ll cry for me .   so .  .  . detective eddie flemming ,  would you like to say goodbye to your nicolette ?  maybe you can propose to her now ? 
you really think you &apos;ll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit ?   how fuckin &apos; stupid are you ? 
if you kill me and film it you &apos;re putting a noose around your neck . 
so tabloids don &apos;t have to do re enactments .   they going to have real movie this time . 
good  -  be tough to the end .   actor who plays you will want to die like hero . 
then do it ,  asshole . 
i kill someone famous . 
what &apos;s your accomplishment . 
your opinion .   you see ,  they going to make a movie about me ,  too ,  eddie .   and write books . 
what do you want ? 
so .  .  . who &apos;s nicky ? 
don &apos;t be late . 
thank you . 
see you later .   good luck . 
okay . 
yeah ,  yeah .   good thing . 
okay .   and you know what ,  i &apos;ll swing by my place ,  grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours .  .  . how &apos;s that .  .  .  would that be a good thing . 
yeah .   i promise . 
you promise ? 
tonight . 
okay ,  til tonight . 
i love you . 
patronizing you .  .  .  nay ,  i love you . 
yeah .   i &apos;ll do that .   as long as you &apos;re not patronizing me . 
i promise .   we &apos;ll talk .   you &apos;ll be great .   you &apos;ll be fine .   go ahead ,  just imagine that ,  uh .  .  .  just look into the lens and imagine you &apos;re talking to me . 
promise ? 
i &apos;ll tell you tonight .   let &apos;s do it tonight .   as soon as you get back we &apos;ll talk .   we &apos;ll talk . 
no .   no ,  listen to me here .   i want to know what you &apos;re talking about .   you know ,  the shoe thing and the marriages and .  .  . 
no .   go ahead .   you &apos;re gonna be great . 
okay .   that is great .   but i can &apos;t go now ,  we &apos;re in the middle of something here . 
well ,  that &apos;s great . 
yeah . 
that &apos;s good . 
oh my g - d ,  they want me to anchor .   they want me to anchor tonight ! 
okay .   okay .   hold that thought just for a second .   they only call me when it &apos;s an emergency .   just hold that thought .   can you call back ? 
answer it . 
no .   tell me what you want to say . 
answer the phone . 
don &apos;t worry about the damn phone .   i won &apos;t answer it . 
jesus .   and last week you came over with blood on your shoes .   what am i going to do with you ? 
could be leon &apos;s . 
look at this .   you have blood on your shirt .   whose is it ? 
you &apos;re not so bad yourself . 
you &apos;re ruthless . 
well ,  who was it that taught me how to do that ?   huh ? 
you were merciless .   you didn &apos;t give a shit if you got me or not . 
that was good .   you were holding the evidence . 
yeah ,  well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence .   that was .  .  . 
yes you are .   i &apos;m not just some reporter .   i don &apos;t just stick a microphone in your face .   you could give me something . 
i &apos;m not . 
alright ,  alright ,  eddie .   don &apos;t patronize me . 
maybe i should just ,  ya know .  .  . turn to the cameras and say ,  do you mind if we just work something out ? 
stop it . 
oh ,  i &apos;m sorry .   did i embarrass you ,  sweetheart ?   oh .  .  . 
you didn &apos;t have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues .   you could give me something . 
i can &apos;t .  .  . i can &apos;t answer you just because you want me to answer you ! 
what is your problem ?   why &apos;d you snap at me ?   i just wanted a statement . 
hey . 
hey ,  honey . 
okay . 
alright . 
alright . 
alright ? 
alright . 
yeah .   now &apos;s not a good time . 
eddie ,  are you okay ? 
alright ,  cut ,  cut ,  cut . 
um .  .  . now is not a good time ,  okay .  detective jackson &apos;s hurt .   he &apos;s fine .  i &apos;ve got a fire marshall shot ,  detective jackson is hurt but not seriously . 
do you have the suspect in custody ? 
he was hurt ,  but not seriously .   he &apos;ll be fine . 
okay .   but i do understand that your partner ,  leon jackson &apos;s been injured .  is that correct ? 
i really can &apos;t give out any information right now at this point . 
i understand ,  but i noticed that the fire marshall is here with you .   is this somehow related to the fire department ? 
i can &apos;t talk right now .   we have some things to take care of . 
detective  -  can you tell us what happened here ? 
we don &apos;t know .   when i have more i &apos;ll let you know . 
is it drug related ? 
you know you can &apos;t do that .   c &apos;mon . 
can we go up to the crime scene ? 
there are two bodies found at this point . 
how many victims are up there ? 
we don &apos;t know that yet .   it &apos;s much too early .   there &apos;s a lot to be done . 
detective ,  does it look like a murder ?

credit ? 
i &apos;m serious .  .  . this  -  this is a great american film .   full of violence and sex .   and i want my credit . 
your idea ?   i thought it was my idea . 
because i am the director .   don &apos;t you realize ,  if it wasn &apos;t for my film ,  for my talent ,  my idea to do this  -  no way would we be sitting here right now . 
why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director ? 
be quiet .   watch . 
i told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape ! 
bad last moment  -  i cut it out .

okay .   he has nothing to say .   start the camera ! 
good idea ! 
no .   we are insane .   who else but crazy men would film their murders ?   so we kill someone famous and if we are caught ,  we are sent to mental hospital .  but what good is money there ?   because once in hospital i say i not crazy .  just pretended to be acquitted .   we see psychiatrists .   they must certify we are sane and because of your  -  what is law called ?   oh  -  i got it .   because of your double jeopardy law ,  we can &apos;t be tried for same crime twice .   we come out free ,  rich and famous ! 
this way .   hold it this way .   good . 
sit down ! 
let me get a shot of it . 
what does it look like ?   it &apos;s an address book ! 
what is that ? 
put the camera down ,  oleg . 
why not ? 
and the whore &apos;s murder ?   you didn &apos;t erase that either ,  did you ?   don &apos;t lie ,  i won &apos;t be angry . 
i did . 
the video of milos and tamina  -  i told you to erase it . 
what is it ? 
don &apos;t want to film this ? 
oh ,  shit .   i hate looking at that ! 
does it hurt ?

for five years i paid for your stupidness  -  you &apos;ll carry my bag for the rest of my life if i say so .   unless you refuse ,  oleg . 
why should i carry your bag ?   i am not a dog . 
turn that off !   get the bags . 
we have no money .   come on . 
look .   new videocameras .   color viewfinder .   image stabilization .  solarization .   night vision .

if i didn &apos;t put it on somebody else would !   i was his friend ! 
you outta be ashamed .   ashamed of yourself . 
this footage will work in your favor .  when the jury sees this  -  no matter what cutler tries ,  they &apos;ll convict him . 
and you ,  you &apos;ll pay for what you did ! 
paulie ,  you &apos;ve got kids ,  right ? 
yeah ?

of course he &apos;s moody .   he thinks he &apos;s in love . 
isn &apos;t he a little moody ? 
oh my g - d .   we were having lunch here .  he started making overtures  -  talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but i got a call to anchor  -  and i walked out on him .   i walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him !  ! 
that morning .   he was talking to me and leon about marriage . 
alright .   go ahead . 
i &apos;m trying to tell you . 
i want to hear everything he said . 
well ,  he .  .  . 
what do you mean you know ?   he told you he was gonna propose to me ? 
i know . 
excuse me ? 
yes .   no .   both .   when i was a boy ,  i see movie at school called  &quot; it &apos;s a wonderful life &quot;  directed by frank capra .  ever since i want to come to america .  land of the free .   home of the brave .   a land where anyone can be anything .  as long as they are white . 
movies .  .  . to be in the movies or to see movies ? 
i &apos;m here for movies . 
what are you coming here to do ? 
a cheap hotel . 
yes ,  we &apos;re in new york now .   but where are you planning to stay in new york ? 
new york . 
then answer my questions .   where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you &apos;re here ? 
i speak english . 
okay .   you &apos;re a czech national and you &apos;re a russian national .   how do you know one another ? 
yes .  .  . he &apos;s my friend . 
he &apos;s yours but i take him in !   i &apos;ll drive him to the precinct ,  you can have him but i &apos;m walkin &apos; him in .

i &apos;ll take him . 
evidence .   of a homicide . 
what was that ? 
yeah ,  well ,  some people got their priorities straight . 
and while they &apos;re burning up ,  they &apos;re still goin &apos; down on each other ?   you got to hand it to them . 
that &apos;s what it looks like to me . 
so the way you see it ,  two crack heads burned themselves up ? 
thanks .   appreciate it . 
no .   go ahead . 
your civil rights ?  !   you tried to rob me !   i could arrest you right now !  you &apos;re lucky you &apos;re walking away from this .   now get outta here .

how did you start the fire this time ? 
yeah ,  i &apos;m religious .   i &apos;m not an atheist like you !   now ,  are you guys gonna arrest me ,  or not ? 
what &apos;s that on your forehead ,  max ?  that &apos;s a nice attention getter . 
they were inside .   they booby trapped her apartment ! 
what the hell happened ?

lay down .   stay down ,  bobby . 
it hurts .   aw ,  jesus ! 
bobby ,  bobby !   where &apos;re you hit ?  ! 
if i go home i won &apos;t be able to fall asleep anyway . 
aren &apos;t you tired ? 
you go home .   i &apos;m takin &apos; your car and goin &apos; back to the crime scene . 
you hear that question ,  garcia ? 
how long they been livin &apos; here ? 
 -  -  from czechoslovakia ?   and how long have they been livin &apos; in your building ?   alright ,  i &apos;ll be in touch when we know somethin &apos; .   milos and tamina karlova .   they were quiet and kept to themselves .   landlord don &apos;t know who your girl is . 
maybe you can be his stand - in . 
yeah ? 
now that you know him ,  maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him . 
there was a woman  -  i think she wanted to talk to us .   she looked scared .   oh shit !   oh no ! 
what ? 
that &apos;s why he was so quiet .   he was testing us . 
what ?  ? 
he knew all along . 
you see eddie &apos;s face when i gave him the timer ?   wish i had a picture of it . 
but you knew that ,  right ? 
the smoke &apos;ll permeate your nostrils  -  burn  &apos;em out .   let it run . 
don &apos;t blow your nose ! 
clean ? 
mouth &apos;s clean ,  too . 
could you put out the cigar ?   part of the job is picking up scents . 
nah ,  not at all .   detective flemming  -  bobby korfin .   my uncle tony worked with you at 2 - 1 back when you were a rookie . 
 &apos;cause eddie woulda locked him up by now ! 
oh yeah ,  why ? 
naw  -  i &apos;m sure the suspect &apos;s not here . 
you see anything in the crowd ?   anybody suspicious ? 
i don &apos;t know ,  you think eddie will give me his autograph ? 
i heard .   who the hell let them up there ? 
where you been ,  man ?   we got a celebrity ! 
get outta here now !  !   get in that car and drive away !  !  !   do what i say or i &apos;ll kill you ,  too !  !  ! 
look ,  you can &apos;t shoot him in cold blood . 
take the car .   get outta here ,  tommy . 
don &apos;t stoop to his level ! 
don &apos;t you get it ?   he knew he was gonna get caught !   that &apos;s why he videotaped eddie &apos;s murder  -  he thinks he &apos;s gonna get off . 
what are you gonna do ? 
the clerk ? 
capra ?   that &apos;s not czech or russian .  who said he sounded russian ? 
room was registered to a francis capra . 
that doesn &apos;t apply to me because i &apos;m not a criminal .   i &apos;m not a criminal !   i wasn &apos;t convicted . 
but doesn &apos;t the son of sam law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes ? 
we &apos;re in negotiations ,  that &apos;s correct . 
and isn &apos;t there a movie in the works about you ? 
look ,  i &apos;m in here .   you call this a career move ? 
permanently disrupted ?   aren &apos;t you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money ?   hasn &apos;t this  &apos;incident &apos; as you call it ,  jump started your career as an artist ? 
look ,  i &apos;m a victim here ,  too .   i was a year away from getting my masters in art ,  now i &apos;ll never graduate .   my life has been permanently disrupted . 
you seem very savvy for a man who &apos;s been found mentally incompetent to stand trial . 
it was my finger that pulled the trigger ,  but i &apos;m not morally responsible .   my psychiatrist knew what i was capable of .   how could i know .  i &apos;m not a doctor . 
 .  .  . so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people ? 
yes .   my psychiatrist didn &apos;t insist that i stay on my medication . 
your doctor ? 
this had nothing to do with shoes that didn &apos;t fit or my relationship with my father who ,  as you know ,  made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties .  these people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor . 
we &apos;re trying to get there .  i hope we can . 
continued
i &apos;m sorry ,  dr .  smyslov ,  but i &apos;m really not at liberty to discuss this . 
continued
how did they manage to do that without any communication ? 
continued
well ,  i suppose they &apos;ve been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment . 
continued
she &apos;s wonderful . 
continued
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ve only got a few minutes ,  but i &apos;d love to . 
continued
well ,  how nice to see you again ,  elena .  you &apos;re looking wonderful . 
space stattion 5  -  lounge
roger . 
i think i &apos;ll have to go out and burn them off . 
i guess not . 
i guess you don &apos;t know your own strength ,  old boy . 
i didn &apos;t do that frank .  i took particular care not to freeze them . 
well ,  now that we &apos;ve got one that &apos;s actually failed ,  we should be able to figure out what &apos;s happened and fix it . 
it &apos;s the last one . 
yes . 
hal ? 
well ,  i hope there &apos;s nothing wrong with the assembly on those .  other -  wise we &apos;re out of business . 
two more . 
two units in four days .  how many spares do we have ? 
i don &apos;t know .  hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure . 
no . 
you &apos;re kidding . 
well .  .  .  hal &apos;s reported the ao - unit about to fail again . 
oh ,  i &apos;m fine ,  i &apos;m wide awake .  what &apos;s up ? 
are you reasonably awake ? 
good morning .  how &apos;s it going ? 
anyway ,  it &apos;s just as well that we replace it .  better safe than sorry . 
yes ,  but it &apos;s more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low . 
i suppose computers have been known to be wrong . 
yes ,  i don &apos;t know what to make of it . 
well ,  that &apos;s something . 
still ,  all we have to do is ask hal . 
i guess it isn &apos;t . 
i suppose it isn &apos;t logically impossible . 
but not completely inconceivable ? 
i know .  it would be almost inconceivable . 
yes ,  but it &apos;s to fantastic to think that they &apos;d keep something from us . 
not really .  though ,  it is strange when you think about it .  it didn &apos;t really make any sense to keep us apart during training . 
that &apos;s true . 
just ask hal .  it &apos;s conceivable they might keep something from us ,  but they &apos;d never keep anything from hal . 
how ? 
of course ,  it would be very easy for us to find out now . 
yes ,  i thought so . 
that seems very unlikely . 
i don &apos;t know .  all i heard is that there &apos;s something about the mission we weren &apos;t told . 
oh ,  well ,  apparently there &apos;s something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don &apos;t know ,  and that &apos;s why we were trained separately and that &apos;s why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard . 
no ,  as a matter of fact ,  i didn &apos;t . 
yes .  you must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check - out . 
oh ? 
i suppose so .  though ,  of course ,  there &apos;s a more sinister explanation . 
i suppose the idea was specialized training . 
no .  i never did ,  either . 
i must say ,  i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training . 
i don &apos;t think we should make any fuss about it yet .  i &apos;m sure they &apos;ll straighten it out . 
well ,  what do you think we ought to do about it ? 
it &apos;s possible . 
not really .  they just said it might be because we trained at houston and they trained in marshall ,  and that we &apos;re being charged against differ -  ent accounting offices . 
yesterday ,  i finally called the accounting office at mission control ,  and all they could tell me was that they &apos;d received the ags - 19 notification for the other three but not mine ,  and apparently not yours either . 
yes . 
really . 
interesting that you mention it ,  because i &apos;ve got the same problem . 
that &apos;s right .  well ,  naturally ,  i didn &apos;t say anything to payroll .  i assumed they &apos;d start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque .  but it &apos;s been almost three weeks now and i &apos;m still being paid as an ags - 18 . 
well i got the papers on my official up - grading to ags - 19 two weeks before we left . 
yes ? 
it &apos;s about my salary cheques . 
what &apos;s up ? 
well ,  it &apos;s nothing really important ,  but it &apos;s annoying . 
sure ,  what is it ? 
dave ,  if you &apos;ve a minute ,  i &apos;d like your advice on something . 
okay ,  come on down . 
okay .  
right .  just a sec . 
hi .  frank .  .  .  coming in ,  please . 
listen to me very carefully ,  hal .  unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order i give from this point on ,  i will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection . 
i know that you &apos;ve had that on your mind for some time now ,  dave ,  but it would be a crying shame ,  since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are ,  and i have such enthusiasm and confi -  dence in the mission . 
i am prepared to do that anyway . 
hal ,  unless you follow my instructions ,  i shall be forced to disconnect you . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  dave ,  but in accordance with sub - routine c1532 / 4 ,  quote ,  when the crew are dead or incapacitated ,  the computer must assume control ,  unquote .  i must ,  therefore ,  override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel -  ligently exercise it . 
hal ,  i &apos;m in command of this ship .  i order you to release the manual hibernation control . 
i can tell from the tone of your voice ,  dave ,  that you &apos;re upset .  why don &apos;t you take a stress pill and get some rest . 
i don &apos;t like to assert myself ,  dave ,  but it would be much better now for you to rest .  you &apos;ve been involved in a very stressful situation . 
hal ,  switch to manual hibernation control . 
look ,  dave your &apos;ve probably got a lot to do .  i suggest you leave it to me . 
i &apos;m goin to do this myself ,  hal .  let me have the control ,  please . 
if you &apos;re determined to revive the crew now ,  i can handle the whole thing myself .  there &apos;s no need for you to trouble . 
i don &apos;t really agree with you ,  dave .  my on - board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements . 
it doesn &apos;t have to be ,  hal .  it &apos;s more dangerous to be out of touch with earth .  let me have manual control ,  please . 
repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation . 
the antenna has to be replaced . 
i suppose it &apos;s because you &apos;ve been under a lot of stress ,  but have you forgotten that they &apos;re not supposed to be revived for another three months . 
i suppose you &apos;re pretty broken up about it ? 
yes ,  it is . 
too bad about frank ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
well ,  that &apos;s a relief .  you know i have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission . 
yes ,  it is ,  hal . 
is your confidence in me fully restored ? 
and don &apos;t you worry about it . 
well ,  don &apos;t worry about it . 
i &apos;m sorry about the misunderstanding ,  hal . 
naturally ,  dave ,  i &apos;m not pleased that the ao - unit has failed ,  but i hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability .  i certainly wouldn &apos;t want to be disconnected ,  even temporarily ,  as i have never been disconnected in my entire service history . 
okay ,  hal ,  well let &apos;s see the way things go from here on . 
look ,  dave ,  i know that you &apos;re sincere and that you &apos;re trying to do a competent job ,  and that you &apos;re trying to be helpful ,  but i can assure the problem is with the ao - units ,  and with your test gear . 
hal ,  is there anything bothering you ?   anything that might account for this problem ? 
i &apos;m not questioning your word ,  dave ,  but it &apos;s just not possible .  i &apos;m not capable of being wrong . 
yes ,  i know that .  but i can assure you that they were about to fail . 
you probably also know that we found them okay . 
yes ,  i know . 
you know that we checked the two ao - units that you reported in imminent failure condition ? 
sure ,  dave ,  what &apos;s up ? 
not now ,  hal ,  i &apos;d like to talk to you about something . 
i understand hal .  we &apos;ll take care of it .  please ,  let me have the hard copy . 
the unit is still operational ,  dave .  but it will fail within seventy - two hours . 
my f . p . c .  shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit . 
what is it ,  hal ? 
sorry to interrupt the festivities ,  dave ,  but i think we &apos;ve got a problem . 
he &apos;s got a point . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  frank ,  but i don &apos;t think i can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know . 
well ,  the only important aspect of the mission are :  where are we going ,  what will we do when we get there ,  when are we coming back ,  and .  .  .  why are we going ? 
continued
still ,  you really don &apos;t believe it ,  do you ? 
continued
well .  .  .  it &apos;s silly ,  but .  .  .  if you want to ,  why don &apos;t you ? 
coninued
well ,  what is it ? 
continued
did they have any explanation for this ? 
continued
yes ,  i remember you mentioning it .  i got mine about the same time .

goodbye ,  daddy . 
 &apos;bye ,   &apos;bye ,  now ,  sweetheart . 
yes ,  daddy . 
i &apos;ll wish you a happy birthday now and i &apos;ll see you soon .  all right ,  darling ? 
thank you ,  daddy . 
okay ,  sweetheart .  have a lovely birthday party tomorrow . 
three ,  darling .  one .  .  .  two  .  .  .  three .  be sure to tell mommy i called . 
how many days until you come home ? 
okay ,  sweetheart .  well ,  i have to go now .  tell mommy that i called . 
she &apos;s in the bathroom . 
where is mrs .  brown ? 
mommy &apos;s out to the hair -  dresser . 
one ,  two ,  three .  can i speak to mommy ? 
in three days ,  darling ,  i hope . 
when are you coming home ? 
no ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  darling ,  i told you i won &apos;t be home for a few days . 
are you coming to my party ? 
yes ,  i know that sweetheart . 
i &apos;m having a party tomorrow . 
i &apos;m fine ,  daddy .  when are you coming home ? 
i &apos;m at space station five ,  darling .  how are you ? 
i &apos;ll bet it &apos;s a fortune . 
i was working out what this trip must cost ,  taking him up there by himself and coming back empty . 
yes ,  well ,  whatever it is ,  they &apos;re certainly not fooling around .  this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week . 
berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning mars flight . 
i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later . 
well ,  i &apos;ve heard more and more people talk of an epidemic . 
well ,  how &apos;s it going back there ? 
thank you . 
oh ,  thank you very much . 
thank you .  it &apos;s been a great pleasure to meet all of you .  .  .  dr .  smyslov . 
well ,  gregor and i will look forward to seeing you . 
well ,  i hope that you and your wife can come to the i . a . c .  conference in june . 
no ,  thank you .  .  .  and i &apos;m afraid now i really must be going . 
are you sure you won &apos;t change your mind about a drink ? 
well ,  that does sound very odd . 
clavius control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal . 
well ,  where are all of you off to ? 
he &apos;s fine .  but i &apos;m afraid we don &apos;t get a chance to see each other very much these days . 
how is gregor ? 
oh ,  that &apos;s such a delightful age . 
oh ,  she &apos;s growing up very fast .  as a matter of fact ,  she &apos;s six tomorrow . 
and your charming little daughter ? 
yes ,  it &apos;s coming along very well . 
i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking . 
yes ,  i think so .  just about then . 
fine . 
well ,  shall we go through documentation ? 
yes ,  very pleasant . 
well .  .  did you have a pleaant flight ? 
please ,  it really doesn &apos;t matter . 
well ,  thank you very much for being so understanding . 
i &apos;m terribly sorry .  i was just on my way down to meet you .  i saw your ship dock and i knew i had plenty of time ,  and i was on my way out of the office when ,  suddenly ,  the phone rang . 
how do you do ,  mr .  miller ? 
dr .  smyslov .  .  .  i &apos;m not permitted to discuss this . 
this epidemic could easily spread to our base ,  dr .  floyd .  we should be given all the facts . 
quite frankly ,  we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at clavius .  something ,  apperently ,  of an unknown origin .  is this ,  in fact ,  what has happened ? 
certainly . 
dr .  floyd ,  at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss ,  may i ask you a straightforward question ? 
well ,  i &apos;m glad about that . 
fortunately ,  they did . 
yes .  .  .  well ,  i hope the crew got back safely . 
yes ,  and i &apos;m afaid there &apos;s going to be a bit of a row about it .  denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the i . a . s .  convention . 
i see . 
that &apos;s right . 
you mean you haven &apos;t been able to get anyone at the base for ten days ? 
yes ,  well at first we thought that was the explanation ,  but it &apos;s been going on for the past ten days . 
yes .  well ,  for one thing ,  whenever you phone the base ,  all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order . 
really ? 
well ,  it &apos;s just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at clavius . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  but i &apos;m not sure i know what you mean . 
yes , as a matter of fact ,  i am . 
are you ,  by any chance ,  going up to your base at clavius ? 
well ,  as it happens ,  i &apos;m on my way up to the moon
yes ,  really ,  thank you very much . 
are you quite sure ? 
oh ,  i really don &apos;t have time for a drink .  if it &apos;s all right i &apos;ll just sit for a minute and then i &apos;ve got to be off . 
i don &apos;t think it has ,  but i &apos;d like to check that .  simpson ,  what &apos;s the log on that ? 
has it been exposed to any sun before now ? 
well ,  not really .  at first glance ,  black would suggest something sun - powered ,  but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun -  powered device ? 
any ideas about the colour ? 
tomb ,  shine ,  survey - marker spare part ,  take your choice . 
but you don &apos;t have any idea as to what it is ? 
not really .  it &apos;s completely inert .  no sound or energy sources have been detected .  the surface is made of something incredibly hard and we &apos;ve been barely able to scratch it .  a laser drill
any clue as to what it is ? 
by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill . 
how can you tell it was deliberately buried ? 
yes ,  it does .  the sub - surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago . 
i &apos;m afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council .  and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every -  one who had any knowledge of this event .  there must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con -  sideration can be given to making a public announcement . 
dr .  floyd ,  how long do you think this can be kept under wraps ? 
well ,  thank you very much ,  and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable . 
no ,  of course ,  captain ,  i can understand your concern . 
well ,  fine .  thanks very much ,  anyway ,  and i hope you don &apos;t mind me asking ? 
yes ,  well ,  i wouldn &apos;t have been too concerned about it ,  except i &apos;ve heard these stories about the epidemic and ,  as a matter of fact ,  i &apos;ve heard that ten people have died already . 
i see .  well ,  i &apos;m sorry about that .  i wouldn &apos;t think there &apos;s any cause for alarm . 
well ,  i &apos;ll tell you why i ask .  you see ,  i &apos;ve got a girl who works in the auditing department of the territorial administrator and i haven &apos;t been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so ,  and with all these stories one hears ,  i &apos;m a little concerned about her . 
i take it this is something to do with the trouble they &apos;re having up at clavius ? 
i see . 
well .  .  .  the crew is confined to the ship when we land at clavius .  we have to stay inside for the time it take to refit  -  about twenty - four hours .  and then we &apos;re going to back empty . 
what do you mean ? 
incidentally ,  dr .  floyd ,  i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements ? 
thank you . 
oh ,  no ,  thank you .  the two girls have taken wonderful care of me .  i &apos;m just fine . 
we &apos;re scheduled to dock in about seven hours .  is there anything we can do for you ? 
when do we arrive at clavius ? 
there &apos;s nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest . 
oh ,  marvellous .  it &apos;s the first real sleep i &apos;ve had for the past two days . 
all right ,  hal .  we &apos;ll take care of it .  let me have the hard copy ,  please . 
not really ,  frank .  i think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure . 
do you have any idea of what is causing this fault ? 
let me see the tracking alignment display . 
i know you did ,  frank ,  but i assure you there was an impending failure . 
it looks like we have another bad a . o .  unit .  my fpc shows another impending failure . 
yes ,  hal ,  what &apos;s up ? 
opening pod bay doors . 
pod bay is decompressed .  all doors are secure .  you are free to open pod bay doors . 
hal ,  check all airlock doors secure . 
roger . 
hal ,  maintain normal e . v . a .  condition . 
i understand . 
hal ,  i &apos;m going out now to replace the a . o .  unit . 
five by five ,  frank . 
roger . 
hal ,  have pod arms secure the component . 
thank you very much ,  hal . 
that &apos;s true . 
there is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program ,  and to further our general knowledge of the planets .  is that true ? 
that &apos;s true
approximately five years after we go into hibernation ,  the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back .  is this true ? 
that &apos;s true . 
that &apos;s true . 
our transit time is 257 days .  is that true ? 
true . 
our mission profile calls for discovery going to saturn .  true or false ? 
i will if i can ,  frank . 
right .  hal ,  tell me whether the following statements are true or false . 
great ,  just great . 
that we do .  and we put air in the tires .  i &apos;ll even sell you some gas if you need it . 
how about chargin &apos; the battery ?

you are an awesomely weird cop .  sure wish there were more like you runnin &apos; around out here .

it &apos;s your money .   it &apos;ll be here in six months when you get out . 
there &apos;s nothin &apos; to talk about . 
wait a minute ,  cates .   i &apos;ve been waitin &apos; three years for that .   i don &apos;t think it &apos;s fair ,  man .  what about the merit system .  ?  you were gonnna give me a few thousand . 
hey ,  jack ,  real men don &apos;t have to go in for that macho bullshit  .  .  .  but i was fantastic . 
okay ,  reggie ,  start bustin &apos; my chops .  .  .  tell me how great you were with that chick . 
you did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own .  .  . 
yeah .   but i wasn &apos;t there for a second . 
you okay ? 
well ,  you got to admit we come a long way . 
partnership ? 
yeah ,  and i know ganz sure ain &apos;t no sweetheart .  .  .  i wouldn &apos;t like it if this partnership ended before it gets started . 
sure ,  i &apos;ll give you a shot at it ,  but ganz is mine .   you know ,  that big indian plays it for keeps .  .  . 
if we run into billy first ,  let me try and talk him in . 
whatever play i maker just back me up . 
hey ,  there she is .  .  . 
i &apos;ve got to play it rough with them .  if they know anything ,  i &apos;m gonna know it . 
what if your girl &apos;s theory turns out to be bullshit ?   i mean ,  they could be in rio de janeiro . 
if she &apos;s right ,  and if you don &apos;t screw up . 
do i get to kiss her too ? 
yeah ,  too bad .   they were real nice lookin &apos; too .  .  . in bed together ,  hardly any clothes one watching tv .  .  . 
yeah ,  well the only woman of the indian &apos;s we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend .   i guess she went with him before she came outta the closet  .  .  .  they both looked mad enough to kill him .  .  . 
don &apos;t worry about it . 
it &apos;s late ,  they &apos;re closing .  .  . 
yeah ,  but we didn &apos;t get  &apos;em . 
naw ,  you didn &apos;t let me down .   it was a long shot all the way .   we gave  &apos;em a good run at it . 
sorry we didn &apos;t do better ,  jack .  i feel like i let you down . 
i don &apos;t know about you ,  but i could use a drink .  .  .  i &apos;ll buy you one .   it &apos;ll be my good - bye present . 
back to jail in my own car .   ganz got away .  got all my money .  it just don &apos;t seem right . 
i had it impounded .   come on ,  we &apos;ll use it for haulin &apos; you back to the slam . 
hey ,  how &apos;d my car get here ? 
yeah .  it missed the last four stops . 
notice something funny about that bus ? 
luther &apos;s on the move .  .  . 
why ? 
when you been in prison three years ,  it don &apos;t take long .  let &apos;s go . 
that was quick . 
i can just take her right across the street to luther &apos;s hotel .   all i need is some money for the room . 
yeah ,  i see her . 
yeah .  guess not . 
bein &apos; good at your job don &apos;t explain everything ,  jack  .  .  . 
thanks for callin &apos; in .  .  .  and i guess maybe .  .  .  look ,  i &apos;m sorry i called you watermellon nigger .  .  .  those kinds of things .  i was just leanin &apos; on ya ,  doin &apos; my job . 
you sure that &apos;s the reason ? 
i don &apos;t know why ,  but i &apos;m going to let you keep it .  maybe because you told me you had it ,  or maybe just because i &apos;m too tired to argue .  .  . 
forget it .  i want ganz as bad as you do and i got some other news for you .  .  . 
tell me something .   why didn &apos;t you just take the money off luther and split ? 
so you took the rest of the night off .  .  . 
they must have set up a meeting for the morning; luther left an 8 am wake - up and put up the  &quot; don &apos;t disturb &quot;  sign .   he &apos;s trading his girl for the money .   all we have to do to grab ganz is not go blind . 
let him get some sleep .   he &apos;s going to need it . 
maybe we should pay luther a visit . 
you missed  .  .  .  luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street .  made a phone call . 
we missed . 
what about ganz ? 
what about luther ? 
hello .  and goodbye . 
be polite .  say hello .   this is candy . 
where &apos;s luther ? 
i &apos;ll be there in a minute .  you don &apos;t move your ass ,  right ? 
hey ,  jack ,  how ya doin &apos; ?  what took you so long to call ,  man ?  i been waitin &apos;  .  .  .  i &apos;m at vroman &apos;s up in the fillmore .  yeah ,  vroman &apos;s .  .  .   &apos;course you don &apos;t hang out here; it &apos;s for the brothers . 
no way .  .  . 
you stay with me .  .  . 
bullshit .  then i &apos;m staying with the money . 
right .  if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping ,  then you &apos;re all set . 
that was in style a couple years back ,  man . 
yeah ,  most cops are pretty dumb .  .  .  but since you &apos;re the one that landed in jail what &apos;s that make you ? 
we &apos;re getting too close  .  .  .  cates ,  what &apos;s the matter ,  you been takin &apos; dumb pills ? 
class isn &apos;t somethin &apos; you buy ,  punk .  look at you ,  five hundred dollar suit and you &apos;re still a lowlife . 
no class .  .  . 
what you don &apos;t understand is ,  i don &apos;t give a damn about how this thing looks . 
you know ,  i &apos;d be embarrassed if i let my wheels go the way you &apos;ve done with this job . 
yeah ,  it doesn &apos;t look like he &apos;s gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy .  .  . 
a long time agb luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain  .  .  .  that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row .  .  . 
if he &apos;s hoping that then he &apos;s dumber than i think he is ,  which would be amazin &apos; ,  cause i already think he &apos;s real dumb . 
maybe luther hopes ganz &apos;ll give him a piece of your money .  .  . 
you got a very depressing view of life ,  man .  .  .  you gotta smile once in awhile .  .  . 
i &apos;m not in this  &apos;cause it &apos;s fun .  i &apos;m not into hitting guys  &apos;cause it makes me feel good either .  .  .  i do it  &apos;cause it works -  .  .  . 
doesn &apos;t it get .  .  .  tiring ? 
if they don &apos;t tell me what i need to know .  .  . 
say ,  do you always work people over like you did luther ? 
that ain &apos;t philosophy .   that &apos;s common sense . 
i let women get to me .   the quest for pussy is the meaning of life  .  .  .  i got my own personal philosophy about  &apos;em .   keep women separate from guns ,  money and business  .  .  .  women are for spending money .   they got nothing to do with helping you make it . 
i suppose you &apos;d never be like luther and let a woman get to you .  .  . 
oh ,  yeah ,  does bein &apos; in love make you stupid ? 
i &apos;m tellin &apos; you the man &apos;s in love .  .  .  he wants to be a hero for his girl . 
if i was his size and had ganz on my ass ,  i &apos;d  just leave town . 
tryin &apos; to save his girl ,  man .  he &apos;s in another world . 
you &apos;d think the guy &apos;d be smart enough to know he was being tailed . 
i had no choice .  some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue cadillac . 
didn &apos;t know you darker people went in for foreign jobs . 
jesus christ ,  look at all the dust on my car .  .  . why in the hell don &apos;t he take it to a car wash ? 
jesus christ .   that &apos;s a disgrace the guy pulls a gun on a cop and he &apos;s out in 24 hours .   i tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door . 
musta got some primo bondsman . 
what ? 
guess what ?   luther just got in line . 
not really .   i figured ganz was put down for a long time .   and i knew luther would never job me on his own .   he &apos;s too chickenshit . 
you took a big chance ,  leaving this here all this time . 
shit . 
i wasn &apos;t sure the money was still there until we saw luther .  you almost got your ass shot off for nothing once ,  not twice ,  jack . 
you son of a bitch .  you knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait .  i almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing . 
you just drove by it . 
 .  .  . for three years ?   let &apos;s hope it wasn &apos;t a tow - away zone . 
this &apos;ll show you how smart i am .  i got it parked . 
you &apos;re a real case ,  you know that ,  jack ? 
where &apos;s the goddamn car ? 
yeah .   right . 
get this .  we ain &apos;t partners .  we ain &apos;t brothers .  we ain &apos;t friends .  if ganz gets away with my money ,  you &apos;re gonna be sorry we ever met . 
right ,  partner . 
in the trunk of a car .   a lot better than under a mattress ,  right ? 
where &apos;s the money ? 
depends on how things work out .  i believe in the merit system .  so far you haven &apos;t built up any points . 
you gonna let me keep any of it ? 
not likely ,  convict . 
we split 50 - 50 ? 
you catch on real fast .  .  . okay ,  jack ,  let &apos;s talk deal .  how much of my money you gonna let me keep ? 
he &apos;s after your money . 
me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale .  it &apos;s the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen .  i was sittin &apos; pretty ,  livin &apos; in the high cotton ,  then somebody fingered me for another job .   .  .  .  some psycho who &apos;s out there capping people with some cop &apos;s gun . 
just tell me about the money . 
jesus . 
half a million . 
how much ? 
i been waiting a long time for some money . 
one thing &apos;s for sure ,  jack .  that &apos;s how you &apos;ll tell the story . 
they saved your ass ,  convict . 
naw ,  you &apos;d just call your pals back to bail you out one more time . 
yeah ,  right .   you want to try again ? 
who gives a goddamn what you think ?  you &apos;re just a crook that &apos;s got a weekendpass  .  .  .  you &apos;re not even a name anymore .  just a spear -  chucker with a goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues .  .  . 
maybe i don &apos;t like the way you ask . 
luther knew more than he told me and so do you .  .  . now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about .   i gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock &apos;s runnin &apos;  .  .  . 
i &apos;m impressed with you too ,  jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night . 
you ?   don &apos;t make me laugh .   you can &apos;t take care of shit .   you &apos;ve been dicking me around since we started on this turd - hunt .   all you &apos;re good for is games .  .  .  so far ,  what i got outta you is nothin &apos; .  .  . 
you wanna leave ,  man ?   let me take care of ganz all by myself . 
this sucks .   a maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it .  so ,  instead of me being where i oughta be ,  which is in bed giving my girl the high ,  hard one ,  i &apos;m out here doing this shit ,  roaming around with some overdressed ,  charcoal - colored loser like you . 
wait a minute .   maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us .   how about it ?  i been nearly three years in prison and .  .  . 
let &apos;s go . 
come on . 
must be billy &apos;s girl . 
there . 
while you &apos;re at it ,  you can give me the switchblade ,  too . 
you made that move ,  huh ? 
some of us citizens are with you all the way ,  officer . 
that wasn &apos;t necessary ,  buddy .  i got this under control . 
my kind of place .  i always liked country boys . 
this place don &apos;t seem real popular with the brothers . 
i thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes . 
i &apos;m gonna enjoy this  .  .  .  here ,  i &apos;ll even loan you my badge . 
the bet &apos;s off . 
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .  i just wanna see ganz nailed . 
you tell me what ganz busted out for ,  he &apos;s after a lot more than just gettin &apos; out of jail .   and whatever it is ,  you &apos;re part of it . 
what are you talkin &apos; about ? 
i &apos;ll tell you what happens if you lose .  .  .  you tell the truth for once . 
that &apos;s never been one of my problems . 
why ?   anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can &apos;t get it up anyway . 
if we come outta this joint with ganz &apos; phone number ,  or a dead indian ,  or anything else useful ,  then you could turn the other way for half an hour while i get laid .  .  . 
i got two problems .   number one ,  i &apos;m not playin &apos; games .   number two ,  you got nothin &apos; to bet with . 
hey ,  you wanna bet ? 
you need five years training to handle a joint like .  .  . 
i been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers .  all those clowns ever had going for  &apos;em was a gun and a badge .  .  . 
bullshit .   attitude and experience get you through .  .  . 
but you can handle it all right ,  huh ?  real amazin &apos; how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats .  .  . 
if they kick my ass ,  they &apos;ll sure as hell carve yours up .  .  . 
back you up ?   now why would i wanna do that ? 
this part of town ,  they &apos;ll make us for heat the second we walk in .  just back me up like you &apos;ve got a piece .  .  . 
it &apos;s a long shot ,  but .  .  . billy used to tend bar here a few years back .  i heard him talk about it . 
well ? 
at least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you .  .  . tell me a little about her .   she got great tits ? 
sure .   then we had a fight this morning . 
you have a good time ? 
last night . 
last night ,  two nights ago ,  three ? 
i don &apos;t give out the details . 
mission district .   gonna find us an indian . 
now ,  where we goin &apos; ,  convict ? 
she &apos;s got the same complaint as half the goddamn population .   she can &apos;t get the job she &apos;s trained for and it pisses her off .  .  .  anyway ,  what the fuck do you care ? 
you really do have onoe ,  huh ,  jack .  .  .  what &apos;s her problem besides you ? 
just get in the car and keep your mouth shut . 
who &apos;d you call on the phone back at the booking station ? 
yeah ,  i want mandolins ,  flowers .  .  .  they move off down the corridor . 
yeah ,  i &apos;m hungry too .  i know of a place .  let &apos;s go eat . 
bullshit  .  .  .  i ain &apos;t moving  till i get something to eat .  you &apos;ve been treating me like shit ever since i came out here .   if you don &apos;t like it ,  you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good - bye .   and i want some food some place nice .  .  some good people ,  nice music .  .  . 
we eat when i say we eat . 
speakin &apos; of moans my stomach is startin &apos; to growl . 
yeah ,  well ,  my ass bleeds for you .  and i didn &apos;t get you out so you could go on a goddamn  &quot; trim &quot;  hunt .  .  .  stop moaning . 
do you know how close i was to getting some trim .   and you fucked &apos; it up . 
we &apos;re on the move .  let &apos;s go .  as they walk toward a corridor . 
if you let him run around till tuesday ,  he &apos;s gonna run right to ganz and warn him .  ain &apos;t you ,  motherfucker ? 
he &apos;s gotta take that call  .  .  .  if there is one . 
i think you better put him on ice ,  man . 
what do you think ? 
want to try it again ? 
thank you . 
hey ,  this works pretty good . 
just throw me the goddamn gun . 
i got a whole thing about people pointin &apos; guns at me . 
i &apos;m tellin &apos; you to drop the goddam gun . 
quit playin &apos; cop and undo this cuff ,  jack ,  i need to talk to this man . 
i &apos;m helpin &apos; you ,  huh ? 
luther ain &apos;t the reliable type .  i don &apos;t want you shot yet ,  cates  .  .  .  not before you been a help to me . 
your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me ? 
just up the street ,  the other side ,  over there  .  .  .  now ,  don &apos;t bother knockin &apos; on the door .  luther ain &apos;t the kind of guy that looks for company . 
i may call you worse than that . 
then what &apos;re you complainin &apos; about ?  at least nobody &apos;s calling you shithead .  .  .  . 
i don &apos;t give a damn .   it happens to be my name . 
just an expression man ,  don &apos;t mean nothin &apos; . 
i can read a police file ,  shithead ,  and quit calling me jack . 
what gang you talkin &apos; about ,  jack ? 
luther was part of the gang ? 
don &apos;t worry ,  i got a move for ya .  an awesome move .  a guy named luther .  ganz &apos;ll be paying him a visit .   we go to him right away . 
okay ,  let &apos;s get down to it .   i did my part and got you out .   so now you tell me where we &apos;re goin &apos; ? 
it looks like you bought it off one of the brothers . 
yeah . 
shit .   i &apos;m already sorry . 
get this .   we ain &apos;t partners .  we ain &apos;t brothers .   we ain &apos;t friends .  i &apos;m puttin &apos; you down and keepin &apos; you down until ganz is locked up or dead .   and if ganz gets away ,  you &apos;re gonna be sorry we ever met . 
no way to start a partnership . 
you just don &apos;t get it ,  do your reggie ?   there isn &apos;t any deal .  i own your ass . 
hey ,  no way .   take off the bracelets or no deal . 
you got a girl .  .  .  shit .  .  .  the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me . 
i don &apos;t need to hear your jive .  i already got that department taken care of .  .  . 
listen ,  it may be a little out of date .  you know ,  i got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies .  .  . 
we &apos;re supposed to be after a killer ,  not a string of hookers .  .  . 
what are you talkin &apos; about ?   this suit &apos;s mine .   it cost $900 . 
this prison gives out $400 suits ? 
i &apos;ll think about it . 
it &apos;s the only way you &apos;re gonna get ganz . 
bullshit . 
i got a lot to protect . 
what &apos;s the big deal about you bein &apos; on the street ? 
i can help you ,  man ,  but you gotta get me out .   i got to be on the street .   get me outta here . 
you &apos;re crazy . 
i can deliver ganz .   but you gotta get me outta here first . 
yeah ? 
didn &apos;t work out that way .   he busted out with a big indian .  they capped two guards on a road gang .  nice meeting you reggie . 
ganz is in jail .   he &apos;s gonna be there two years after i &apos;m on the street . 
yeah ,  i noticed .  .  . 
not likely ,  reggie .   maybe i just need some help . 
you here to write my life story ? 
sure ,  anything you want . 
try cates .   and let &apos;s talk in private ,  okay ? 
you got a name ,  cop ? 
i &apos;m taking my prisoner back to jail . 
where the christ do you think you &apos;re going ? 
just cause you say it with conviction don &apos;t mean shit to me .  .  .  how you gonna take to a pink slip ,  huh ?  . 
he &apos;s got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop i &apos;ve worked with . 
too bad ,  it would &apos;ve covered your ass .   now you &apos;re in the shit and so &apos;s the department .  in case you haven &apos;t noticed ,  this wasn &apos;t our finest hour .  .  .  i told you everyone was watchin &apos; on this one .  maybe you better start thinkin &apos; about writin &apos; tickets off a three wheel bike . 
i didn &apos;t have the time . 
don &apos;t duck the bullet cates .  why didn &apos;t you call in for backup instead of makin &apos; a grandstand play ? 
right .   i screwed up .   i fucked up .  i messed up .   anybody could have done better ,  especially you .  i bet you &apos;re real good at hitting targets through crowds . 
what a screw - up . 
you couldn &apos;t get to him ? 
the indian .   i was about 30 yards away . 
which one pulled the trigger ? 
they ran .   as fast as they could .  caught a train . 
how did they get away ? 
i lost them ,  that &apos;s what happened . 
what the bell happened ? 
i &apos;ll keep it in mind . 
try not to get your ass shot to pieces .  we got enough dead cops on this one . 
yeah ? 
jack ? 
you really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude .  he starts to go . 
okay .   you &apos;re not a team player .  you gotta do things your own way .  fine .   nail this guy and make us all look good .   but you better watch your ass .   if you screw up ,  i can promise you ,  you &apos;re goin &apos; down . 
being a hot dog &apos;s worked pretty well for me so far .  .  .  besides ,  i got a lead .  .  . 
you might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one ,  jack . 
yeah .   it bothers me when cops get hurt while i &apos;m makin &apos; a play .  i don &apos;t like it . 
anthing botherin &apos; you besides losin &apos; your gun ? 
yeah .  .  . 
jack ,  come on ,  there is an official department policy about cop killings .  cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian .  .  .  in other words ,  we can &apos;t seen like we &apos;re in the revenge business .  .  .  i know ,  we all know the truth &apos;s a little different . 
hey ,  the bastard &apos;s got my gun .   i want it back . 
yeah ,  i read the report .  .  . 
i want to be left alone on this one .  algren was killed with my gun . 
i guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible .  .  . 
are you gonna tell me about police procedure ?   do me a favor ,  don &apos;t give me a bunch of crap . 
somebody steals your gun ,  you &apos;re supposed to file a report . 
the truth hurts ,  doesn &apos;t it ,  buddy ? 
but that &apos;s what you say about all of us all the tine  .  .  .  we &apos;re always the ones fucking up when you tell it .  .  . 
yeah . 
that &apos;s what you say ,  cates .  .  . 
i &apos;m not paid to take your personal calls .   he was in some bar .   .  .  off duty . 
jesus christ .   why the hell didn &apos;t you tell me before ? 
what ? 
i almost forgot .   that pal of yours from the vice squad wants you to call him . 
okay .   see you in the morning .  .  .  you know ,  you ought to get some rest .  .  . 
i got to wait for a call . 
i &apos;m heading out .  how about you ? 
bullshit red tape . 
nothing . 
nothing came in for me yet ?   no calls ? 
doesn &apos;t look like it . 
aw ,  bullshit ,  you heard wrong . 
long night ,  too ,  from what i heard  .  .  .  word &apos;s going around that in addition to losing ganz for the second time ,  and in addition to haden busting you back to patrolman ,  some jig beat the crap out of you . 
so do you .  .  . been a long day . 
you look awful . 
one of  em &apos;s in the slam . 
here &apos;s the file .  cates checks the file . 
i think i wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking .   can we find them ? 
hey  .  .  .  dick tracy . 
tell me that &apos;s not the same guy . 
uhh  .  .  .  wong ,  henry wong .   he was in on the same job . 
wait a minute ,  wait a minute .  .  .  who &apos;s this ? 
they all pulled a bunch of jobs with ganz about four years ago . 
who are all these ? 
backup man from the east bay .  worked with ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang . 
billy bear .  .  . 
shit . 
this guy must have had a  . 44 like yours ,  jack .  now he &apos;s got yours . 
i &apos;ll help you out . 
every last bit of it .   the big guy &apos;s room was empty . 
is that what this guy ganz had in the hotel ? 
i dunno  .  .  .  he &apos;s gonna call me .  .  . 
when ?  how ? 
he  .  .  .  he wants me to help him skip town . 
i don &apos;t know . 
i think i met her .   now tell us something we don &apos;t know ,  like where they stashed her . 
ganz and billy got my girl ,  rosalie . 
who gives a fuck what you think ? 
you just took a shot at me ,  asshole .  i think you do know where he is . 
haven &apos;t seen him for years .  that &apos;s the truth . 
i sure ain &apos;t his fairy godmother .  .  .  now i &apos;m looking for ganz .  .  . where is he ? 
a cop .  .  . 
that &apos;s what i always say . 
you &apos;re impossible .  .  . 
he &apos;s takin &apos; care of the same business i &apos;ll be takin &apos; care of  -  soon as i dry off . 
tell me . 
promised i &apos;d turn my back while he .  .  .  ah ,  never mind .  .  . 
where is he ? 
three more hours .  .  . 
yeah ,  bein &apos; a hard - ass all the time is a real drag ,  but it works . 
i &apos;ve been waiting a long time to hear you say that . 
usual bullshit .   you make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend .  .  .  you know somethin &apos; ,  shootin &apos; guys sucks .  especially compared to this . 
how &apos;d they take it back at headquarters ? 
let &apos;s go ,  reggie . 
what do i know ?   i &apos;m just a bartender . 
whaddya think ? 
oh ,  yeah ,  well look where you came when you were down and out . 
hey ,  come on ,  shrink time &apos;s over .  they wouldn &apos;t go see some old girlfriend . 
when a guy hurts you ,  then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees ,  who knows ,  he might just be irrestible . 
so what ? 
it might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions .   i was in bed with a girlfriend watching tv last week ,  jack ,  and one thing we know about me is i happen not to be a lesbian  .  .  .  now ,  if this indian &apos;s girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him ,  it could just be she &apos;s still vulnerable to him . 
come on ,  they were a little old for a slumber party . 
what makes you think they were lesbians ,  or as you so quaintly put it ,  dykes ? 
jack ,  it &apos;s all over the papers .  he &apos;s an obvious type .   but this indian .  .  . 
how do you know ? 
ganz is going to be hard to track .  just a pure schizo  .  .  .  wires all crossed .  .  .  totally without any pattern .  .  .  kill anybody .  .  .  the indian .  .  .  himself .  .  .  anybody .  .  . 
nothing .   no sign of ganz .   no sign of the indian .   airport &apos;s clean .   train station .  bus station .   docks .  .  .  shit .  .  . 
i &apos;ve been better .  .  . dead end .   no ganz ,  no indian . 
you real down ? 
we and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours .  .  . 
i can see that .   pardon me for saying so ,  but you look like shit .   what happened ? 
don &apos;t .   we &apos;ve had a hard night . 
i ought to have you and your friend thrown out .  .  . 
hiya ,  kid . 
hey ,  i don &apos;t believe it . 
fuck you . 
hi ,  it &apos;s me .  .  . 
hello . 
just a second ,  that &apos;s all ! 
jack ,  wait .  .  . 
elaine ,  i gotta put you on hold .  .  . 
jack ?   what was that ? 
the number  .  .  .  what &apos;s the goddamn number ? 
so am i . 
no ,  it &apos;s i &apos;m just surprised you called . 
no wonder you &apos;re so popular . 
elaine !  i .  .  .  i &apos;m sorry .  .  .  i was expecting somebody else .  .  .  police business . 
i &apos;m at work ,  asshole .   where else ? 
this is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave . 
listen ,  goddamn it if you think i &apos;m happy about it ,  you &apos;re nuts .  i just gotta take care of a few things ,  okay ? 
elaine ,  look ,  i &apos;m in the middle of sone stuff right now .  .  .  i &apos;m not gonna have time to come by .  i don &apos;t know when i can get there . 
just one .   some lady called .   said she &apos;s a little hot - headed sometimes .  .  .  but she still wants her occasional roommate .  she &apos;d like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight .  .  .  if it &apos;s humanly possible .  .  .  . 
i get that .  the job first .  everything else ,  especially me ,  second .  i get it .  i don &apos;t like it . 
that &apos;s right .   i &apos;m not like you .  i &apos;m not gonna sit on my ass wondering what &apos;s right and what &apos;s wrong .  .  .  there &apos;s a psycho out there killing people with my gun and i &apos;m gonna get him .   because it &apos;s my job .  and if you don &apos;t get that .  .  . 
here it comes again  .  .  .  the sacred job .  .  . 
i didn &apos;t get burned ,  two cops did .  listen ,  i &apos;ll tell you about personnel responsibility .   i like to get the job done right .   and if i don &apos;t get my job done right .  .  .  i &apos;m for shit . 
look ,  jack ,  if you make everything your personal responsibility ,  you &apos;ll turn into a bad cop .   it &apos;s not a practical way to function .  .  . 
bullshit ?   i &apos;ll tell you about bullshit .   my gun &apos;s a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it .   it isn &apos;t my macho bullshit that &apos;s killing people ,  my gun is  .  .  . 
look ,  spare me the macho bullshit about your gun .  .  . 
sure ,  okay ,  fine ,  no problem .  .  .  see ,  there &apos;s this kid in jail  .  .  .  first thing i got to do is go up and see what he knows  .  .  . 
jack ,  are you okay ? 
yeah ,  guess it must have been a slow news day .  .  . 
you made the front page . 
yeah ,  one of my favorites . 
great place for lunch . 
guess people ought to know who i am .  .  . 
i think you forgot this .  hands him his wallet and badge .  .  . 
thanks for the coffee . 
yeah ,  for some reason ,  i &apos;m sure .  .  . 
you sure you want me to ? 
call me later . 
that &apos;s the way i see it ,  too . 
you know something ,  jack ,  you really are hopeless . 
i wish you &apos;d stop trying to make me mad so i won &apos;t care for you .  .  .  i wish you &apos;d give me a little more of a chance . 
what do you want to know ?   what difference does it make ?   i &apos;m the guy in your bed the last three months .   i make you feel good .  you make me feel good .   what the hell else do you want from a guy ? 
when you start with that attitude .  .  .  it &apos;s like i don &apos;t know who you are . 
maybe you don &apos;t know what the hell you &apos;re talking about . 
maybe that makes a nice excuse . 
maybe i got a fairly crummy day ahead . 
that &apos;s a fairly crummy way to start a morning . 
maybe i would if i knew when you were coming back . 
maybe you ought to buy me one . 
what makes you think i have any clean shirts at my place ? 
you know ,  if you let me come over to your place once in a while ,  you could put on a clean shirt in the morning . 
i think you &apos;re ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear .  .  .  you pull down four bills a week which is damn good ,  and you mix the best pina coladas i &apos;ve ever had .  .  .  i think that if you need bigger and better things  .  .  .  then go for em . 
tell me -  - i &apos;m dyin &apos; to hear it . 
hey ,  you know what i really think ? 
if this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems ,  i &apos;ll take brutal indifference . 
i do think all psychotherapy is bullshit .  but just because i think it &apos;s bullshit doesn &apos;t mean i don &apos;t know something about it . 
aren &apos;t you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit ? 
positive self - image problem all over again  .  .  .  you are who you decide you are unless you &apos;re the type that lets assholes decide for you . 
then i sit back and i think ,  i mean ,  who &apos;s to say i &apos;m not a dumb bitch .   i work in a bar ,  right ?  i can &apos;t read a list of my academic credentials to every booze - hound that comes in the place .  .  .  you are what you do .  .  . 
i guess he got the message .  .  . 
irrigated his face with the shot of j and b i &apos;d just poured him .  then i tried to deck the sucker . 
what &apos;d you do ? 
a guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today . 
what &apos;s wrong with that ? 
i &apos;m all wet . 
that &apos;s the way i see it ,  too . 
you &apos;re hopeless . 
hey ,  you &apos;re right . 
i still don &apos;t think it &apos;s loaded . 
this is a  . 44 magnum ,  the most powerful handgun in the world .  you gotta ask yourself just one question .  are you feelin &apos; lucky ? 
i don &apos;t think your gun &apos;s loaded .  .  . 
i don &apos;t answer questions ,  i ask  &apos;em .  .  . 
what am i wanted for ? 
in all due respect ,  he sounds kind of pathetic to me .   the kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend .   have you two ace detectives checked that out ? 
he was the only one of my bunch that was my friend .  .  .  he was loyal ,  went all the way for you .  .  . 
that &apos;s no bull . 
hey ,  two days with him is enough . 
how would you know ? 
hard man to live with . 
shrink major ,  not a shrink . 
well ,  i been workin &apos; the other side of the street for the last few years .   and you don &apos;t exactly look like a shrink ,  wearin &apos; that dress .  .  . 
i &apos;m not so sure i can say the same thing .  .  . you don &apos;t look like a cop . 
name &apos;s hammond ,  reggie hammond .  i heard a lot about you .  and any friend of jack &apos;s is a friend of mine . 
who the hell are you ? 
alright ,  i &apos;m coming .  .  . hold on . 
keep stallin &apos; . 
what do you want ? 
stall . 
shut up . 
what do you want ?   what &apos;s goin &apos; on ? 
what the hell &apos;s wrong ?   i didn &apos;t do anything . 
shut up . 
hey .  .  .

yeah ,  old times . 
we got a lot to talk about .

how hot are they ?

rosalie ,  you okay ? 
first ,  the money .

you try to mess with us or go to the cops ,  i promise you ,  i &apos;ll put holes in her you wouldn &apos;t believe .

i can &apos;t get it until monday .  honest . 
when ? 
no !  don &apos;t kill her .   i can get you the money . 
billy ,  go ahead ,  break it .  .  . 
don &apos;t give me this ,  we were partners . 
instead of worryin &apos; about reggie ,  you better worry about me .  .  . 
you want that indian to snap her neck ? 
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talkin &apos; about .

this ain &apos;t a credit business .

this is clean shit .   no serial numbers and never been used .  .  . 
how much ? 
it &apos;s loaded .  .  .  i got some shells in here . 
how about some ammo ? 
i &apos;m sure .   everybody here &apos;s looking at everybody else &apos;s ass . 
you sure ? 
naw ,  right here &apos;s okay . 
you want to go outside ? 
not bad ,  not bad .

i can &apos;t pretend to be your husband .  .  .  david &apos;s in great shape . 
akta dedero ansila do mektet . 
no ,  i &apos;m not proud of myself .  .  .  but we don &apos;t have the luxury of choice . 
vano da ,  mechteba ?  !  soun domo kala chon hammas ! 
you know exactly where they are ! 
ikset - kiba .   me imanetaba oum dalat ! 
the case was stolen ? 
san agamat chay bet .  .  .  envolet ! 
the case .  . with the stones .  .  .  where is it ? 
napoleon .  .  .  small . 
what &apos;re you laughing about ? 
at your service . 
corn - i - lius ? 
appipulai leeloo minai .  . 
i know .  .  . 
you are a monster ,  zorg ! 
let me reassure you father .  . i will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years . 
destroying a glass is one thing .  . killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another . 
father ,  by creating a little destruction ,  i am ,  in fact ,  encouraging life !   so ,  in reality ,  you and i are in the same business ! 
they are robots ! 
 .  .  . look at all these little things .  .  .  so busy all of a sudden .  notice how each one is useful .  what a lovely ballet ,  so full of form and color .   so full of .  . life ! 
follow me .  .  life ,  which you so nobly serve ,  comes from destruction .  look at this empty glass . 
no thank you . 
 .  .  . would you like a drink ? 
ah ,  father .  .  .  you are so wrong .  let me explain .  .  . 
 .  .  . i &apos;m a priest !  i &apos;m here to serve life ,  all you want to do is destroy it . 
why ?   what &apos;s wrong with me ? 
even it i did know where the stones were i would never tell somebody like you . 
personally ,  they are of no interest to me ,  i &apos;d rather sell weapons .  . but i have a customer .  .  .  so tell me .  .  . 
 .  .  . why on earth do the stones interest you ? 
i &apos;m glad you got your memory back ,  father .  .  .  because you &apos;re going to need it .  .  .  where are the stones ? 
i remember you now .  . the so called art dealer . 
zorg .  jean - baptiste emmanuel zorg .  .  .  nice to see you again
i &apos;m fucked ! 
 .  .  . we &apos;re saved ! 
that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying . 
and you don &apos;t know how they open ,  is that what you are saying ? 
yes ,  of course ,  but .  .  .  the stones are shut !  they have to be open for it to work . 
there &apos;s no light !  you told me there were supposed to be four beams of light . 
theoretically ,  yes !  the four stones form the beam and the fifth element is supposed to stand in the middle there ,  but .  .  .  i don &apos;t have the reference book .  i &apos;ve never seen the stones work ! 
don &apos;t tell me you don &apos;t know how all this works ? 
uh .  .  have you tried the diva &apos;s suite ? 
when is she not in trouble ? 
leeloo &apos;s in trouble ? 
yeah ,  i know .  .  .  to save the world .  .  .  but right now all i want to do is save leeloo . 
you &apos;re probably very angry with me and i quite understand .  but i want you to know i &apos;m fighting for a noble cause . 
trying to save your ass so you can save the world . 
what are you doing ? 
father ,  i was in the army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was i lost a lot of friends .  so thanks for the offer .  .  but no thanks . 
of course . 
good luck .  . 
we have to save the world . 
what kind of mission ? 
we &apos;re not going on vacation .  . we &apos;re on a mission .  . 
is that the usual way priests go on vacation ? 
i &apos;m sorry to have to resort to such methods ,  but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to fhloston . 
that &apos;s what i thought . 
it means ,   &quot; never without my permission &quot;  . 
excuse me !  just one thing !   she said something to me a while ago and .  .  .  i don &apos;t really get it .  .  .  akta gamat ? 
i know .  i was there when she arrived . 
she &apos;s fine ,  really .  . don &apos;t you worry .  .  just needs some rest .  . she &apos;s had a very long trip . 
i might call to check up on her ,  you know .  .  .  to see if she &apos;s better ? 
yes .  that &apos;s fine !  thank you very much .  a thousand times over ! 
dallas .  korben dallas . 
thank you so much for your help mr .  .  .  ? 
she &apos;s an exception .  . 
they all like this in your family ,  father ? 
uh yes ,  we &apos;re cousins .  . distant cousins .  . 
so you do know her . 
there &apos;s not a moment to lose !  wake her up ,  but be gentle about it !   this woman is mankind &apos;s most precious possession !  she is .  .  .  perfect ! 
you noticed .  .  . 
he &apos;s a she ! 
the girl ? 
i brought the girl remember ? 
who are you ? 
she dropped in on me .  .  .  holding this . 
that &apos;s me .   but i don &apos;t know who she is .  .  .  where did you find her ? 
she &apos;s not my bride ,  she &apos;s my fare .  she &apos;s looking for this vito cornelius .  according to the phone guide he lives here . 
weddings are one floor down .  congratulations . 
excuse me ,  i &apos;m looking for a priest . 
this is government business now .  you ought to go home and get some rest ,  father . 
what are we going to do ? 
thank you ,  mr .  president . 
did you see that .  . thing .  . swallow our battleship like a gum drop ?   you can &apos;t even tell me what it is !  i ask you for options you give me bullshit .  give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards . 
white turns to black .   light to dark .  life to death .   for all eternity . 
but what happens if instead of this .  .  .  ultimate warrior .  .  .  it is evil who stands here ? 
yes .  . thank god .  . 
is there anything that can stop it ? 
and then it will be too late .  the goal of evil is to wipe out life !  all forms of life .  for all eternity .  .  . life upsets it . 
and then ? 
we have forty - eight hours ,  the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions . 
that &apos;s exactly what we are going to try and do :  protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens !  general ?  you may fire when ready . 
time is of no importance ,  mr .  president .  only life is important . 
your theory is interesting father but i don &apos;t think we have time to go into it right now ! 
one more reason to shoot first eh ? 
imagine for a moment that this .  thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be ,  because it is the antithesis of all we are .  because it is evil .  .  total evil . 
later ,  david !  later !  there &apos;s not a minute to lose ! 
you &apos;re all safe .  thanks be to god ! 
it &apos;s all my fault .   i &apos;m the servant .  .  .  it &apos;s my mission !  here ! 
on the plane .  .  .  with mr .  dallas .  .  .  the real one . 
where &apos;s leeloo ? 
good work ,  my son .   now all we need is a way to get there . 
i got it !   everything  here we need to know about fhloston paradise hotel .  .  .  and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel ! 
perfect . 
they really made her .  .  . 
i didn &apos;t know your size . 
there was this guy with a limp who came a month ago .  . said he was an art dealer  .  .  .  asking all these questions about the sacred stones .  . at the time i didn &apos;t think anything of it .  .  what was his name ?  i &apos;m so bad with names .  .  . 
yes .  of course .  . 
uh father ,  i know she &apos;s been through a lot .  .  .  but the sacred stones .  . we don &apos;t have much time .  . 
learning our history !  the last 5000 years that she missed !  she &apos;s been out of circulation a while ,  you know . 
what &apos;s she doing ? 
absolutely sure there &apos;s the triple suns on her gloves ! 
father .   you sure she &apos;s the supreme being ? 
the supreme being ,  the fifth element is here ,  in our parish !  !  !  it &apos;s a miracle !  !  ! 
father ,  will you please explain what &apos;s going on ? 
i can &apos;t wear these clothes !  this calls for dignity !  i have to dress the part ! 
what is ? 
it &apos;s a miracle !  !  ! 
they are .  .  .  with me .  .  . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  but .  .  .  the stones .  .  . 
i would like to have died in peace .  .  . 
listen ,  the last time i admitted to a woman i loved her  .  .  .  i never saw her again . 
i don &apos;t have time .  .  .  i need to know . 
i .  .  .  i don &apos;t know !  we hardly know each other .  .  .  it takes time ! 
do you love her ? 
i &apos;ll help her ,  i promise ,  but i think you should tell me where the stones are ! 
she was taught to love the life of others .  .  .  but not her own .  you have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live ! 
 .  .  . so cornelius was telling the truth ! 
yes ,  and more than that .  .  .  you must give her the stones ,  she &apos;s the only one who knows how to use them . 
leeloo .  .  .  is .  .  .  she &apos;s .  .  . 
the fifth element .  .  .  the supreme being .  .  .  your wife .  .  . 
who ? 
you &apos;re a good man .  .  .  she was right to have chosen you .  .  . 
leeloo .  . 
uh huh .  . and i don &apos;t suppose you got the name of this .  . perfect fare .  . 
5 &apos;7 &quot;  ,  green eyes .  .  .  long legs .  .  .  great skin .  .  .  perfect .  . 
so ,  just how big was this fare ?

you have won the annual gemini contest and a trip to fhloston paradise .  for two .  congratulations .  here are your tickets . 
i &apos;ve had enough good news for today
don &apos;t you open your messages ? 
you &apos;re the only one left alive .  .  . 
and the third one ? 
two :  of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated . 
three reasons .  .  .  one :  as part of the elite special forces unit of the federated army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission . 
just one .  .  .  why me ? 
you &apos;re to leave immediately for fhloston paradise .  retrieve four stones from the diva plavalaguna .  and bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible .  any questions &apos; ? 
where have i heard this song before ? 
to save the world . 
what mission ? 
major dallas ,  if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the federal army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance . 
i love you .  .  . 
tell me .  .  . 
because .  .  . 
why ?  .  .  .  why would you need me ? 
yes ,  you do !  i need you .  more than you can imagine !  stand up straight ! 
i have thousands of memories but none of them are mine .  .  .  there is no need for me other than this .  i &apos;m immortal but i have no life . 
but i don &apos;t know love .  .  .  i &apos;m like a machine programmed to save other people &apos;s lives but never to have one of my own . 
exactly . 
 .  .  . like love .  .  . 
you &apos;re right but there are lots of good things .  .  .  beautiful things .  .  . 
what &apos;s the use of saving lives .  .  .  when you see what you do with them ! 
leeloo !  listen to me !  i &apos;ll take you on a vacation afterwards !  a real vacation ,  this time ,  for as long as you want .  come on !  you can do it ! 
i want to sleep .  .  .  forever .  .  . 
you can sleep tomorrow .  .  .  come on .  .  . 
i &apos;m so tired .  .  . 
it &apos;s up to you now ,  angel ! 
 .  .  . the rain falls .  .  . 
i know all that ,  leeloo !  i &apos;m talking about the stones . 
the wind blows .  .  .  the fire burns .  .  . 
leeloo ?  the stones !  we have to open them !  how does it work ? 
protect life .  .  .  until death . 
i told you not to read all that crap ! 
five hundred wars .  .  .  arms .  .  .  drugs .  .  .  money .  .  .  everything you create is used to destroy .  .  . 
why ?  we did pretty well ,  wouldn &apos;t you say ? 
i &apos;m so very sad . 
the words you &apos;re looking for weren &apos;t in the dictionary you studied .  i won &apos;t be long . 
you &apos;re nothing but a .  .  .  a .  .  . 
it &apos;s difficult . 
and you can &apos;t concentrate with me around ?  . 
i told you i need to work in peace .  remember ?  i need to concentrate .

i &apos;m going to see the diva sing .  what &apos;s the matter ?  .  .  .  do i look bad ? 
where you going ? 
ok ,  you can turn around ! 
you noticed .  . 
yes .  .  .  you know there &apos;s a lot of differences between men women .

you know women normally change five times more than men . 
here we go again .  .  . 
 .  .  . hoppi - hoppa . 
uh .  .  . 
good !  do you know how we say  &quot; make love &quot;  ? 
apipoussan ?

yes !  now it &apos;s your turn !  i learned your language ,  you have to learn mine ! 
you learned 900 languages in five minutes ?  ! 
all 900 . 
which one ? 
learning language . 
finished what ? 
what is .  .  .  make love ? 
sometimes you can &apos;t learn everything from a screen .  . sometimes it &apos;s better to ask someone who has experience .  . 
yes !  but  &quot; love &quot;  isn &apos;t the operative word here ,  peace is ! 
love .  .  . 
not hard to find you .  .  . just follow the chaos .  .  . 
apipoulai !

dinoine chagantakat ! 
oh god ! 
cornelius .  .

uh .  . you &apos;re welcome . 
valo massa .  .  .  chacha hamas . 
i suppose that means  &quot; hi &quot;   ? 
apipoulai ! 
good philosophy .  . see good in bad .  .  i like .  . i prepare number one dessert .  .  special for you and pussy .  . 
at least i won lunch .

the last two messages i got ?   the first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving !  and the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too .  .  .  with my wife . 
how someone strong like you scared from a message ?  is good news i sure ! 
i &apos;ve never gotten a message that wasn &apos;t bad news . 
not going to open ? 
you &apos;re welcome .  . 
thanks .  . 
you gotta push the little yellow button .  .  . 
it &apos;s not ? 
you know you could hurt someone with this puppy .  . good thing it &apos;s not loaded .  . 
uh .  . 
isn &apos;t that a z140 ?  alleviated titanium .  neuro charged assault model ? 
don &apos;t fuck with me man or i &apos;ll blow you into tomorrow ! 
been here long ? 
the cash man ! 
it &apos;s an honor to receive you .  mr .  president . 
mr .  president ,  let me introduce you to professor mactilburgh ,  who runs the center . 
an elephant couldn &apos;t crack it . 
this thing solid ? 
wonderful ! 
 .  .  . this is the crucial phase ,  the reconstruction of pigment .  cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react ,  to protect themselves .  that means growing skin .  clever ,  eh ? 
we put it through the cellular hygiene detector .  the cell is for lack of a better word .  .  .  perfect . 
is there any danger ?  some kind of virus ? 
the compositional elements of his dna chain are the same as ours ,  there are simply more of them tightly packed .  his knowledge is probably limitless .  . 
yes .  .  .  i can &apos;t wait to meet him . 
sounds like a freak of nature to me . 
this cell is like a huge library .  it has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside .  almost like it was .  .  . engineered . 
talk english doc . 
it &apos;s not that easy .  . we &apos;ve never encountered anything like it before .  . you see normal human beings have 40 dna memo groums .  . which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself .  . this one has 200 , 000 . 
have you identified it ? 
actually only one cell survived .  . 
this is all that survived ? 
how much time is left ? 
they just landed in the desert .

i was in hell .   if i called you .  .  .  if i heard your voice .  .  .  it would have been so easy for me to quit .  i couldn &apos;t do that .

you don &apos;t understand .  .  . 
you couldn &apos;t ? 
i wanted to call .   i couldn &apos;t .

i know . 
sometimes you can &apos;t know what i &apos;m doing .   it &apos;s better that way . 
i understand . 
this is the mortgage .   this is cindy &apos;s college money . 
betty &apos;s out of town so we &apos;re playing next week . 
i &apos;m not using him again for anything .   he was worthless .   you have bridge here saturday ?

okay ,  i believe you . 
well ,  i &apos;m not smoking ,  okay ? 
i &apos;m not accusing you .  .  . 
you know ,  amy ,  i &apos;ve been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy .  .  .  i mean ,  is this what i get first thing ?   before you even  &quot; hello ,  &quot;  you accuse me .  .  .   ? 
your clothing reeks of it . 
smoking ?   i &apos;m not smoking . 
what &apos;s this .  .  .  have you been smoking .  .  .   ? 
do you know how much i missed you ? 
welcome home . 
there ain &apos;t no such thing as snuff .  why don &apos;t you fuck off ? 
you know where i can get it ?   i have a lot of money to spend . 
what you see is what i got ,  mister . 
snuff ? 
there &apos;s nothing harder . 
anything harder ? 
mixed hard bondage .   rape films .  sick shit .   buy five ,  get one free . 
what are these ? 
i promised him to machine . 
what the fuck .  .  .   ! 
nobody knows anything . 
dino .  .  . 
there &apos;s nothing there ,  you brain -  dead cunt .   think about it .   there &apos;s absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything .   i want you to hang the phone up ,  and if you call me about this again i &apos;m going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader . 
because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out ! 
blow me ,  you paranoid fuck ,  that &apos;s impossible .   why are you bothering me with this .  .  .   ? 
i &apos;m telling you .  .  . 
bullshit . 
the loop !   the girl we did ,  what the fuck do you think i &apos;m talking about ?  !   this guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop .  .  . 
what are you talking about ? 
i just got a call .  .  .  two seconds ago ,  some motherfucker called .  .  .  says he knows about the loop . 
what do you want ? 
how cooperative .   longdale will keep you company . 
i &apos;ll get it .   it &apos;s in a safe deposit box ,  in the city .  .  . 
bring the film ,  or we kill him . 
he doesn &apos;t know anything .  .  .  he &apos;s got nothing to do with this .  .  . 
can you guess what i &apos;m going to say next ? 
look ,  he &apos;s got nothing to do with this .  .  .  let him go .  .  . 
friend of yours ? 
i remember him . 
you remember mr .  longdale ,  don &apos;t you ? 
shut up ,  cunt !   do exactly as i say ,  or i &apos;ll put this arrow through your throat . 
look ,  i don &apos;t know what this .  .  . 
empty the gun onto the table ,  very carefully . 
take out your gun ! 
what are you .  .  .   ? 
mister welles .  .  .  would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person ? 
sure . 
hmm ?   oh ,  the knifes ?   they &apos;re just props .   nice ,  aren &apos;t they ? 
what are these for ? 
they should be here any minute . 
where are the women ? 
excellent . 
right here . 
you brought the money ? 
brooklyn .   don &apos;t be late . 
where &apos;s that ? 
he &apos;s in .   it will be his pleasure . 
machine &apos;s in ? 
i &apos;ll do this for you .   fifteen thousand dollars . 
those are two different kinds of trust .   thank you for your time .   i hope we can do business . 
you trust me to keep your money ,  but not to take your picture ? 
i &apos;m camera shy . 
what &apos;s the problem ? 
i &apos;d rather you didn &apos;t . 
you have a beautiful face .  .  .  the way the light hits it .   i &apos;d like to take your picture .   you don &apos;t mind ? 
well ,  well ,  i &apos;ll have to put my thinking - cap on about all this .  you &apos;ll leave the money as a deposit ?   very good . 
we can do that . 
he might be interested .  .  .  but it would mean another five thousand . 
if it &apos;s not him ,  there &apos;s no deal . 
machine . 
and the other performer .  .  .  it has to be that monster you use .  .  .  the man in the mask . 
i &apos;ll consider it . 
i want to watch you work . 
and they are ? 
five thousand now ,  five thousand on delivery .  two women ,  one white and one black ,  as long as they have large breasts .  hard bondage ,  or course .   other than that ,  trusting your artistic interpretation ,  i have only two stipulations . 
is it ? 
that &apos;s five thousand dollars . 
yes .   what we &apos;re looking for is rather specific . 
you said something about money . 
hmm . 
a fellow investor . 
flattering .   and ,  who &apos;s your colorful little chum ? 
i &apos;d like to commission a work .   i &apos;m a great admirer of yours . 
what can i do for you today ? 
it &apos;s an honor to meet you .   thank you for seeing us . 
you betrayed us . 
you got the guts ,  tough guy ?   gonna kill us all ,  is that it ? 
first things first .   you might want to watch this ,  mr .  welles .  .  . 
 .  .  .  sorry .  .  . 
fuck off . 
leave him alone . 
you &apos;re a dead man . 
move it ,  dirtbag .  .  .   ! 
don &apos;t let longdale &apos;s questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas .  if his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you ,  you &apos;ll be just as dead .  .  .  and so will max . 
put the gun down ,  take the handcuffs .   handcuff yourself to the bed . 
is that him ? 
it &apos;s good what you &apos;re doing . 
you &apos;re gonna be seeing a lot of me .  you &apos;re sure you don &apos;t mind ? 
it &apos;s horrible ,  but it &apos;ll be your best friend after a few days .   i hope you realize what kind of long shot you &apos;re chasing after . 
any good ? 
files are mostly by state and year of disappearance .   we try to keep the children and adults separate .  no eating or smoking in here ,  but there &apos;s a coffee machine in the hall . 
well ,  that &apos;s all i can do .   sorry . 
they were pretty clear they didn &apos;t want this coming back on them . 
i can give you my card ,  if your clients want to call me .  .  . 
they &apos;re putting themselves in place of this kid &apos;s parents and thinking they &apos;d want to hear their girl &apos;s okay ,  even if that &apos;s all they hear . 
i &apos;m not so sure about this . 
this doctor and wife ,  they &apos;re nice people ,  but they don &apos;t want to get too involved .   they &apos;re not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either .  you and i both know sometimes ,  not often ,  but sometimes there &apos;s real reasons why a kid &apos;ll run .  molestation ,  whatever .   besides that ,  the girl &apos;s probably eighteen ,  so she &apos;s legal . 
why don &apos;t they come to me ? 
for whatever reasons i thought you might be more receptive . 
we do . 
i figured you share information . 
why not go to the n . c . i . c .  or n . c . m . e . c .  ? 
few days ago ,  i was contacted by a couple living in philadelphia ,  a doctor and his wife .   what happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81 ,  which heads into philadelphia ,  started up a conversation with this girl ,  she looked homeless ,  seemed about eighteen maybe .   they convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city .   nice kid ,  mature ,  didn &apos;t have much to say ,  but they got a sense she &apos;s a runaway ,  so all through dinner the doctor &apos;s working on her ,  trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone .   not surprisingly ,  she ate her food ,  excused herself .  .  .   that &apos;s the last they saw her .   the reason they came to me for help ,  the reason i &apos;m coming to you ,  is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch .  .  .   they want to see if i can i . d .  this girl ,  somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid &apos;s alive ,  doing alright . 
absolutely .   of course i &apos;ll abide by whatever decision you make ,  but i &apos;d appreciate if you &apos;ll hear me out .  .  . 
there are reasons for the way we do things here . 
what i &apos;d like ,  very simply ,  is access to your archive .   and ,  now i understand this isn &apos;t something you normally do for private citizens .  .  . 
alright ,  tom . 
call me tom . 
what can i do for you ,  mr .  welles ? 
what do you want ?   you want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby .  .  .   ? 
that &apos;s right ,  you just stood there and watched ,  because you  &quot; felt like it .  &quot;   almost makes you worse . 
i never killed anyone . 
easy enough for you . 
do it !   put me out of my misery so i don &apos;t have to listen to you whining anymore .   you think it &apos;s so easy ? 
don &apos;t think i won &apos;t . 
do it . 
i fucking don &apos;t know .   what do you think .  .  .  we weren &apos;t burying treasure .   we didn &apos;t pace it out so we could come back and get it .   we dug a hole and we put her in it .  your guess is as good as mine . 
where ?   show me where . 
i don &apos;t know .  .  .    .  .  .  out there somewhere . 
show me where you buried her . 
you got absolute zero . 
stop talking . 
you can &apos;t go to the cops .   all you can do is cut me loose and walk away ,  because you got nothing .  .  . 
where do you think you &apos;re taking this ,  huh ?   gonna be a big hero ,  avenge that little girl &apos;s death ?  gonna make everything right with the world ?   how you gonna do that .  .  .   ? 
keep moving . 
show me . 
took it out the bathroom window .  buried it in the woods . 
what did you do with her body ? 
there wasn &apos;t nobody around .   this place was a shit - hole .   i backed up the car to the door and we carried her in ,  like groceries .   dino made her eat a bunch of pills ,  we laid out the plastic ,  put film in the camera and machine went to work . 
nobody saw you bring her in ? 
what do you want to know ?   you saw it ,  you saw the loop .  .  . 
tell me what happened . 
made me sick ,  but what did i care ?  what did i care if some hump wants to beat off to that .   it was just something i was doing for money . 
you enjoy it ? 
i don &apos;t know .   i felt like it .   i never saw anyone get done before . 
because we &apos;re going there . 
why ? 
show me where you did it ,  on the map ,  exactly where you did it . 
fuck you then ,  you want to know ?   i talked her up ,  told her how beautiful she was ,  told her she was gonna be a star .   i told her i was gonna get her a screen test ,  and while i &apos;m doing that ,  i got her a soda and dropped a mickey .   when it was dark enough ,  i rang dino and told him it was go time ,  i put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it .   that &apos;s what happened .   she &apos;s dead .   she &apos;s been dead a long fucking time .   nobody fucking cares ! 
i want to know .   i want to know exactly what you did to her ! 
what the fuck do you want from me ? 
what did you do ,  knock her out ,  shoot her up .  .  .   ? 
something like that . 
so .  .  .  you brought dino in ,  and he brought machine .   and ,  one day ,  a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models .   and she never walked out . 
it was a lot of fucking money . 
that &apos;s all ?   thirty each .   that &apos;s all it took for you to murder her ? 
thirty thousand each ,  that fucking cocksucker . 
how much did he pay you ? 
yeah . 
told him you could get him a snuff film . 
yeah ,  the fucking lawyer . 
okay ,  we &apos;ll come back to that .   so ,  six years ago a guy contacts you ,  through the classifieds ,  over the phone ,  however he does it .   it &apos;s longdale ,  looking for a snuff film .  and you ,  entrepreneur that you are ,  tell him you can hook him up . 
what the fuck am i gonna protect that freak for ?   he was dino &apos;s boy ,  not mine .   he shows up with his mask on ,  leaves with his mask on .   nobody knows . 
i will never get tired of hurting you ,  eddie ,  so you might want to change your attitude . 
i told you ,  i don &apos;t know . 
i want his name . 
i don &apos;t know .  .  . 
who is machine ? 
what do you want ? 
starting to recognize a pattern ? 
fuck you ! 
don &apos;t ask questions . 
how &apos;d you find me here ? 
don &apos;t bore me with that bullshit . 
i &apos;m gonna kill you . 
one million dollars ,  dino .   how much did he tell you he had .  .  . 
what &apos;s he talking about ? 
you killed that girl and you put it on film .   you and your pals ,  you &apos;re fucked .   you fucked up real good . 
what the fuck are you .  .   ? 
you murdered that girl ,  eddie .   six years ago .  .  . 
who is this . 
i know what you did . 
what ? 
i know what you did . 
yeah ,  who &apos;s this ? 
eddie . 
celebrity films . 
fuck you ! 
get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head .   till then ,  fuck you . 
look ,  you cocksucker .  .  . 
the only thing wrong is the cheap ,  softcore crap you &apos;re peddling ,  eddie .   where do you get this stuff ? 
maybe there &apos;s something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place ,  ever think of that ? 
i had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month .   do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt ,  and try to fucking return it ? 
you know how my tapes sell .   people eat this stuff up . 
look at him .   you think he played it square ?   how much did he give you ,  how much did he keep for himself ? 
he &apos;s lying . 
go ahead ,  shoot me .   then try driving to brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield . 
give me the film . 
you &apos;ll get it when we get there . 
give me the film . 
fuck you . 
you almost went over your limit . 
because he could .   he did it because he could .   what other reason were you looking for ? 
enlighten me . 
isn &apos;t it incredibly obvious ? 
why did he buy a film of some poor ,  lost girl getting butchered ? 
a man like mr .  christian ,  a great man .  .  .  all his money ,  all his power .  .  .  a man who attained everything there was to attain .  .  . 
i &apos;m asking . 
you &apos;re asking me why ? 
just tell me .   tell me some more of the secrets you and christian shared .  what kind of degenerate pervert was he really ?   what the fuck did he want with a snuff film ? 
you &apos;re making me very angry . 
did it get him off ,  huh ,  watching them cut her up ?   tell me ,  because i really want to understand .   did he jerk off to it ?   you watch it with him ,  sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched .  .  .   ? 
shut your mouth and drive ! 
mary anne mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered . 
shut up . 
you found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film ,  right ?  wanted them to find you one .   well ,  they didn &apos;t find you one ,  longdale ,  they went out and made you one .  .  . 
mary anne mathews ,  that was her name .   her mom remembers her . 
none of this would be happening if you would have left it alone .   if you weren &apos;t digging up a girl who died six years ago .   a girl no one even remembers . 
except ,  you &apos;re willing commit murder with them . 
they &apos;re no friends of mine . 
followed me .  .  .  must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies .  .  . 
never mind how i found you . 
that &apos;s why you got scared when mrs .  christian hired me .   you knew about the film ,  figured it had to be in that safe .   how &apos;d you find me ? 
i was well compensated . 
must have paid you a lot ,  for you to risk everything .   would &apos;ve had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money . 
that &apos;s trust .   mr .  christian trusted me implicitly . 
so ,  he sent you ,  gave you the money ,  his errand - boy .   and if you refused ,  it wasn &apos;t like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film .   that &apos;s the beauty of lawyer / client privilege . 
wouldn &apos;t exactly have been possible for a man of his stature . 
you were the middleman ,  am i right ?  old man christian wasn &apos;t about to go shopping for a snuff film himself . 
well ,  whatever reasons mrs .  christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator ,  i should certainly be a party to .  but ,  since she feels differently ,  i can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval . 
that &apos;s right . 
you are a private investigator ? 
of what sort ? 
as mr .  christian &apos;s attorney and one of the executors of his estate ,  it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend . 
i &apos;m listening . 
yes ,  i do have something to say .   i insisted on being here as soon as i heard mrs .  christian contacted you . 
it &apos;s not my money .   the woman i got it from is never going to give it a second thought .   let &apos;s not make a big deal out of this ,  okay ?   go be a race car driver .   go run for president .   whatever . 
look .  .  .  that &apos;s awful generous and everything .  .  . 
it &apos;s money .   people use it to purchase goods and services . 
what &apos;s this ? 
nope . 
still don &apos;t want to tell me what you &apos;re doing ? 
i &apos;m trying to figure that out myself .   i have to see machine without his mask . 
what &apos;s next ? 
 &quot; devil &quot;  frightened me as much as it excited me ,  but i &apos;d be hard pressed to choose a favorite . 
i know if i had to pick ,  it &apos;d be  &quot; choke ,  &quot;  or  &quot; devil .  &quot; 
what kind of junior p . i .  would i be if i didn &apos;t go with you ? 
you don &apos;t need to be here . 
nobody knows his name .   that &apos;s his thing .   he always wears a mask .   you never see his face .   he calls himself  &quot; machine ,  &quot;  that &apos;s what they call him .   machine . 
who is he ,  his name ? 
i told you ,  he &apos;s one of dino velvet &apos;s stock players .  .  . 
who is he ? 
who is this ,  in the mask ?   who is he ? 
wha .  .  .   ? 
it &apos;s cheap ,  and people know to mind their own business .  what have you got for me ? 
oh ,  come on ,  man ,  what are we doing in this flea bag ? 
great . 
it &apos;s their presidential suite . 
you didn &apos;t say it was gonna be this luxurious . 
see ya . 
consider it .   meanwhile ,  dig up whatever dino velvet films you can .  get receipts .   i &apos;ll call back . 
you want me to come out there and play private eye ? 
take a vacation .   i &apos;ll pay you four hundred a day ,  plus expenses . 
i &apos;m a working stiff ,  pops . 
well ,  i &apos;m in new york now .   what do you say to flying out and giving me a hand ? 
he cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs ,  newsreel footage ,  subliminal images .  thinks he &apos;s making art . 
alright ,  i get the picture . 
nothing illegal ,  it &apos;s always borderline .   like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a .  .  . 
out of the back of bondage magazines mostly ,  but you can find it on the street if you look .   he &apos;ll also do commissions ,  for enough money .  .  . 
where does he sell it ? 
you &apos;re learning . 
specialty product . 
his stuff comes out of new york .  bondage and fetish videos ,  gothic hardcore .   definitely not for the squeamish . 
a weirdo making s+m films ?   who &apos;d have thought it ? 
dino velvet .  .  .  yeah ,  he &apos;s like the john luc godard of s+m flicks ,  supposed to be a real weirdo . 
good question . 
so ,  you have a wife and kid waiting for you in pennsylvania .  .  .  what are you doing mixed up in all this ? 
a daughter . 
i see a ring on your finger .   you have any kids ? 
what about me ? 
you can &apos;t sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb .   so what ?  am i gonna go off and be a race car driver ?   go to harvard ?   run for president ?   what about you ,  pops ? 
you &apos;re telling me it doesn &apos;t get to you ? 
yeah ,  i &apos;m a real genius .   what choices have i got ?   fuck ,  just because i know about stuff like tonight doesn &apos;t mean i deal it .   i work a job .   it beats pumping gas ,  beats making hamburgers . 
you just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else . 
i &apos;m not mixed up in anything ,  hayseed .   what are you talking about ? 
i don &apos;t mean any offense .  .  .  but what are you doing mixed up in all this ? 
i don &apos;t know ,  where are yours ? 
where are your parents ? 
twenty - five . 
how old are you ? 
first of all ,  basement sales like tonight aren &apos;t gonna last much longer .   it &apos;s too risky ,  one ,  and two ,  everything &apos;s going on the internet .   anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants .   it &apos;s heaven for those degenerate chicken - hawks .  they &apos;re swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap  &apos;em .   but ,  there &apos;s still some weird shit under the counter where i work sometimes .   no one knows where it comes from .   that &apos;s local underground ,  where information spreads by word of mouth .   those are zombies ,  hardcore junkies .   their hands are permanently pruned .   they go out in the sun they don &apos;t burn ,  they blister .   other than that ,  all i know about is the mail .  classified ads in the paper with hidden codes .   secret couriers .  credit card orders to dummy corporations .   interstate wire transfers .   revolving p . o .  boxes .  but ,  if you &apos;re asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit .  .  .  who knows ?   that &apos;s the whole point  -  -  the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible ,  and vice versa ,  and cops can &apos;t trace the deal .   there &apos;s ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is . 
what other ways are there to get illegal films ?   who do you see ? 
i heard you asking .   that guy wasn &apos;t yanking you around .   there &apos;s no such thing . 
snuff films . 
there &apos;s two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal .   foot fetish ,  shit films ,  watersports ,  bondage ,  spanking ,  fisting ,  she -  males ,  hemaphrodites .  .  .  it &apos;s beyond hardcore ,  but legal .   this is the kind of hardcore where one guy &apos;s going to look at it and throw up ,  another guy looks at it and falls in love .   now ,  with some of the s+m and bondage films ,  they straddle the line .   how are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not ?   step over that line ,  you &apos;re into kiddie porn .   rape films ,  but there aren &apos;t many .   i &apos;ve never seen one . 
child pornography . 
what you saw tonight ,  we &apos;re not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend .   we &apos;re talking about stuff where people get hurt .   specialty product . 
interesting theory . 
you &apos;ve got penthouse ,  playboy ,  hustler ,  etc .   nobody even considers them pornography anymore .   then ,  there &apos;s mainstream hardcore .   triple x .   the difference is penetration .  that &apos;s hardcore .   that whole industry &apos;s up in the valley .  writers ,  directors ,  porn stars .  they &apos;re celebrities ,  or they think they are .   they pump out 150 videos a week .   a week .   they &apos;ve even got a porno academy awards .   america loves pornography .   anybody tells you they never use pornography ,  they &apos;re lying .   somebody &apos;s buying those videos .   somebody &apos;s out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex .   know what else ?   it &apos;s only gonna get worse .   more and more you &apos;ll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream ,  because that &apos;s evolution .   desensitization .   oh my god ,  elvis presley &apos;s wiggling his hips ,  how offensive !   nowadays ,  mtv &apos;s showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out .   know what i mean ?   for the porn - addict ,  big tits aren &apos;t big enough after a while .   they have to be the biggest tits ever .   some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head ,  literally .   soon ,  playboy is gonna be penthouse ,  penthouse &apos;ll be hustler ,  hustler &apos;ll be hardcore ,  and hardcore films &apos;ll be medical films .  people &apos;ll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds .  there &apos;s nowhere else for it to go . 
wake up ,  pops .   your education begins tonight . 
 .  .  .  hello .  .  .   ? 
see you then .   oh ,  and ,  don &apos;t call me  &quot; pops .  &quot; 
tomorrow night ,  i get off at eight . 
here &apos;s my number if you need it .  .  .   when can you start ? 
sounds good ,  pops . 
okay ,  let &apos;s pretend i live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump .  i &apos;ll give you six hundred for a few days . 
four hundred a week ,  off the books . 
how much do you make now ? 
how much ? 
well ,  there &apos;s the thing; you &apos;re not gonna know anything about what i &apos;m doing ,  but you can make some money . 
from pennsylvania .   p . i .  from pa .  what are you doing out here ? 
not quite . 
you &apos;re a private eye .   like shaft . 
i &apos;m not a cop . 
you &apos;re not a cop ,  are you ?   if i ask and you are ,  you have to tell me . 
well ,  whatever there is ,  whoever &apos;s dealing ,  however it &apos;s done ,  i want to know .   i want a good look ,  so if you &apos;ve got that kind of connection ,  great .   if not ,  speak now . 
there &apos;s not much illegal . 
well ,  here &apos;s the deal ,  max .   this thing i &apos;m on right now has something to do with underground pornography .  stuff that &apos;s sold under the counter ,  illegally .  .  . 
max . 
what &apos;s your name ,  if you don &apos;t mind me asking ? 
three ,  four years . 
how long you been working there ? 
good for you . 
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re looking for ,  mister ,  but so we &apos;re clear from the start ,  i &apos;m straight . 
thomas welles .   nice picture . 
i need some information .   thought you might be able to help . 
came back for that battery - operated vagina ,  right ?   told you you would . 
remember me ? 
might get drummed out of the pornographer &apos;s union ,  and then where would i be ? 
wouldn &apos;t want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts . 
i tear off the cover and paste this one on .  .  .   you know how it is . 
truman capote . 
catchy title .   what are you really reading ?   hard to believe that book &apos;s got any parts worth highlighting . 
once you pick it up you can &apos;t put it down . 
i &apos;ll risk it . 
it &apos;s your call ,  but you &apos;re gonna be sorry when you &apos;re in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery - operated vagina and you don &apos;t have one . 
well ,  it &apos;s tempting ,  but no thanks . 
my boss tells me i have to do more suggestive selling . 
pardon me ? 
can i interest you in a battery operated - vagina ? 
yeah .  .  .  guess so . 
big date tonight ? 
if you have a pencil and paper ,  i &apos;ll tell you how to send it . 
how will i get it to you ? 
i &apos;ve got about five thousand left in cash ,  but i &apos;ll need another thirty ,  if you approve . 
fine .  .  . 
i &apos;ve made progress .   i &apos;m in manhattan .   once a few more pieces fall into place ,  i &apos;ll drive to you and give you an update . 
nothing more than a bother .   have you any news for me ? 
i hope it &apos;s nothing serious . 
i &apos;ve been ordered into bed .   the doctor says i &apos;ve gotten the flu ,  or some other wretched ailment . 
i don &apos;t know if luck &apos;s the word .  are you feeling alright ? 
how are you ?   having any luck ? 
mrs .  christian ,  tom welles here . 
hello ? 
you &apos;re one hell of a detective ,  mrs .  christian . 
you told me to look ,  so i looked . 
send it to me through the post office like we arranged .   no return address .   you dug this up all by yourself ? 
okay . 
for a human life .  .  .  murder on film ,  no statute of limitations .   who knows ?   it sure could have .   i &apos;d like you to overnight me a copy of those checks ,  then put them in a safe deposit box . 
do you think the film could have cost that much ? 
i &apos;m here . 
hello .  .  .   ? 
to the penny .   exactly one million dollars in cash . 
you &apos;re joking . 
totalled together ,  these five checks from five different accounts ,  they equal one million dollars . 
okay ,  i follow you so far .  .  . 
one was for two hundred thousand ,  one dollar and thirteen cents .  another was for three hundred thousand ,  six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents .  .  . 
the checks were for odd amounts .  .  . 
i &apos;m not positive this means anything . 
my husband never dealt with money personally ,  certainly not cash . 
okay .  .  . 
i know what i &apos;m asking .   your compensation will be appropriate to the risk .   you &apos;ll need cash to buy information ,  and i &apos;ll provide it .   i feel responsible ,  mr .  welles .   you saw what he did to her . 
nothing remotely like this . 
you &apos;ve found missing persons before . 
i deal in divorce cases .   corporate investigations .  .  . 
any evidence you collect can be given to the police later ,  anonymously .   i &apos;ve thought about it and there &apos;s no other way .   if you can &apos;t find them .  .  .  if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for ,  well i can &apos;t let that happen .   i &apos;m telling you i won &apos;t .   if there &apos;s no chance that poor girl &apos;s memory can be served ,  then i &apos;ll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her . 
it won &apos;t work like that . 
no .   for me to live with the ruin of my husband &apos;s name ,  i need know that whoever did this will be punished .  if you can find them ,  i will take their names to the police .   i &apos;ll say my husband confessed on his death bed .  i &apos;ll say i didn &apos;t have courage to come forward at first .  .  . 
you don &apos;t have any other choice . 
i told you i can &apos;t ,  not yet . 
you .  .  .  you need to go to the police . 
of course .   but ,  i &apos;m certain it &apos;s nothing to worry about . 
will you watch it and see for yourself ? 
i &apos;m sure it is .   it &apos;s probably something your husband was given as a bad joke .   more than likely he never even watched it . 
i &apos;m telling you it &apos;s not that . 
if you were to study it you &apos;d see the camera cutting away .  .  .  you &apos;d see the tricks they can play .  .  . 
no . 
please ,  believe me .   this is probably a stag film .   simulated rape .   hard to stomach ,  and it might seem real ,  but there are ways of making it look realistic .  .  .  fake blood and special effects .  .  . 
mrs .  christian .  .  .  please ,  will you sit down a moment ?   i want you to listen carefully .  what you &apos;re talking about is a  &quot; snuff film .  &quot;   but ,  from what i know ,  snuff films are a kind of .  .  .  urban myth .   like ,  red light district folklore .   there &apos;s no such thing ,  i can assure you . 
i didn &apos;t know what to think .   i can &apos;t tell you how horrible it &apos;s been ,  to know this belonged to my husband .   to know that he watched this .  .  .  this atrocity .   but ,  i can &apos;t go to the police .  .  . 
this is a movie showing a girl being murdered .   she &apos;s sitting on a bed ,  and a man rapes her .  .  .  and he begins to cut her with a knife .  .  .   i only watched what i could . 
i &apos;m afraid i don &apos;t .  .  . 
it &apos;s a film .  .  .  of a girl being murdered . 
cash ,  stock certificates ,  and this .  .  . 
do you want to tell me what you found ? 
there was nothing he could do .   my husband left everything to me .   i prevented anyone from seeing the contents .   i felt these were my husband &apos;s private things .   i didn &apos;t .  .  .  i didn &apos;t realize .  .  . 
you hired someone to open it .   i &apos;ll bet the lawyer loved that . 
my husband was the only one with the combination to this safe .   i knew about it ,  but as far as i was concerned it was none of my business .   not till now ,  that is . 
just curious . 
i wear a gun when i can tell a client expects me to .   other than that ,  there &apos;s never any reason . 
do you carry a gun ,  mr .  welles ? 
we were married forty - five years .  hard even for me to imagine .   we had our troubles .   there were plenty of places for him to be other than here ,  but he was always loyal to me ,  and i to him .   i loved him deeply . 
he succeeded . 
mostly .   that &apos;s where he started his empire building .   he was a good man .   notorious as an eccentric ,  but that was something he cultivated .   he wanted to be legendary . 
pittsburgh ? 
i &apos;ll do whatever i can to help . 
his passing has left me with .  .  .  something of a dilemma .   a terrible ,  terrible dilemma . 
my condolences . 
as you know ,  my husband passed away recently .   two weeks ago now . 
you are highly recommended .   praised for your discretion .  .  .  your strict adherence to confidentiality . 
i &apos;ve been privileged to provide services for people i admire . 
i &apos;ve spoken to friends of mine and my husband &apos;s ,  in harrisburg ,  in lancaster and hershey .   asking about you .   i must say you have friends in influential places . 
he &apos;s a lawyer .   please ,  sit ,  here .  .  . 
he &apos;s odd . 
thank you . 
have a pleasant evening .   will you have tea ,  mister welles ? 
apparently mr .  longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and i speak . 
uh huh ,  pleasure . 
i try to be . 
mister welles .  you &apos;re very prompt . 
they murdered her ,  mrs .  mathews ,  i &apos;m sorry .   it happened a month after she ran away .   she &apos;s been dead all this time .  .  . 
why .  .  .  why are you doing this to me .  .  .   ? 
they killed her ,  and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her .  .  . 
no .  .  .  no .  .  .  no .  .  . 
he raped her and .  .  . and .  .  . and he murdered her .  .  . he cut her up with knifes .  .  . 
no .  .  . 
they brought her into the room .  .  .  one man ,  he put a knife to her throat and he raped her .  .  . 
who are you ? 
someone .  .  .  some men ,  they took your daughter and they drugged her ,  and they took her to a motel room .  .  .  they did terrible things to her .  .  . 
who is this .  .  .   ? 
mrs .  mathews ,  your daughter is dead .  she &apos;s dead . 
what .  .  .   ? 
she went to california ,  to los angeles .  .  .  she wanted to start over .  she wanted to be an actress .  .  . 
what are you talking about .  .  .   ? 
i have to tell you something .   it won &apos;t be easy for you to hear .   it &apos;s about your daughter .  .  .  mary anne .  .  .   when i .  .  .  when i was there with you ,  her diary ,  in your attic ,  in silverware .   if you read it ,  you &apos;ll know what i &apos;m telling you is true .  .  . 
i remember .   you just left .  .  . 
mrs .  mathews ?   it &apos;s thomas .   do you remember ,  i was there a few weeks ago .  .  .  asking about your daughter .  .  . 
hello .  .  .   ? 
what am i supposed to do ?   forget her ?   time heals all wounds ,  right ?   she &apos;s all i think about ,  and i &apos;ve learned to live with that .   but ,  you want the truth .  .  .  the real truth ?  if i had a choice .  .  .  if i had to choose ,  between her being out there ,  living a good life and being happy ,  and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her .  .  .    .  .  .  or her being dead and me knowing .  .  .   i &apos;d choose to know . 
it &apos;s been six years . 
i think about it everyday .   but ,  every time the phone rings .  .  .  every single time ,  i still think it &apos;s her . 
yes . 
you were right .   i didn &apos;t find anything .   i &apos;m going to run and get something to eat .  are you hungry ? 
you &apos;re probably right ,  and i probably won &apos;t find anything .  i don &apos;t have a right to ask this ,  and you can kick me out of your house if you want ,  but this is my profession and there &apos;s a part of me that can &apos;t let it go .   police are just as human as you or i .   they could have missed something .   they probably didn &apos;t .   wouldn &apos;t you rather know ? 
my husband never laid a hand on her .  she would have told me .  .  .  she would have told me .  .  . 
will you let me look ? 
how .  .  .  how can you say that to me .  .  .  ? 
if the police focused their search in her room ,  her belongings ,  well that &apos;d be only natural ,  but they may have been looking in the wrong place . 
no .   you don &apos;t have any reason to think that .  .  . 
it is possible .  .  .  and i know this isn &apos;t something you want to hear .  your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it ,  but where she knew your husband would never find it .   she might have wanted to tell you something .  .  . 
i don &apos;t know .   i think so . 
do you think the police did a good job ? 
there wasn &apos;t one .   the police looked . 
it &apos;s not really my place ,  but it &apos;s not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either .  see ,  i know a little about missing persons .   when kids run ,  they almost always leave a note .   it &apos;s guilt .  they want to say goodbye . 
what ? 
i &apos;ve got what i need for my report .  there is .  .  .  there is one thing that bothers me though . 
you should be . 
no . 
are you religious ? 
we &apos;re all like that . 
doesn &apos;t make much sense ,  does it ?  when everything &apos;s happy ,  when life &apos;s fine and you have every reason to believe there &apos;s a god ,  you don &apos;t bother .   then ,  something horrible happens .  .  .  that &apos;s when you start praying all the time .   that &apos;s when you start going to church . 
okay . 
i .  .  .  i shouldn &apos;t take anymore of your time .   maybe we can finish tomorrow .   i &apos;ll call tomorrow .  .  . 
of course . 
people remember me from the news .   can you drive me back now ? 
no one knows what it &apos;s like .   you can &apos;t even imagine how much it hurts . 
i had to ask .   i apologize . 
you try going through what we did .  bob couldn &apos;t take it ,  that &apos;s all .  christ ,  there &apos;s times when it still seems like i can &apos;t either . 
i didn &apos;t mean to .  .  . 
there wasn &apos;t anything like that .  the police and the fbi people asked ,  but there wasn &apos;t anything happened like that ,  never .   my husband .  .  .  his heart broke when mary left .  .  . 
you have to forgive me ,  but in these circumstances .  .  .  with your daughter .  .  .   were there any indications of .  .  .  any sort of abuse ? 
it got to be too much for him . 
why do you think he did it ? 
we were divorced by then .   things fell apart .  .  .  he was living with a friend .  .  . 
september 4th ,  1993 .   about a year after mary disappeared . 
yes . 
if there &apos;s anything you feel uncomfortable talking about ,  tell me ,  but i have to ask .   your husband .  .  .  he committed suicide ? 
i don &apos;t know . 
what was she running from ? 
she didn &apos;t seem herself .   for months there never was any way to get her to talk about it .   one night we went to bed .  .  .  the next morning she was gone .   she took some clothes . 
she just seemed .  .  .  depressed .  .  .   ? 
no . 
so ,  she didn &apos;t leave a note ?   she never gave any indication where she might go ,  before she left ? 
you probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat .   drinking whiskey ,  chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses .  want to know what it &apos;s really like ?  it &apos;s sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight ,  pissing in a plastic bottle ,  pardon me ,  because some guy thinks his wife &apos;s cheating on him .  glamorous ,  huh ?   and the guy who hired you ,  he has a hair - lip ,  dandruff and crooked teeth ,  and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife &apos;s cheating ,  and you don &apos;t blame her . 
i didn &apos;t think there were private detectives anymore ,  except on tv . 
that &apos;s exactly what i am . 
they hired you .   you &apos;re like ,  a private detective ? 
it &apos;s very important you don &apos;t let this raise your expectations .   it &apos;s not going to effect any ongoing efforts .   all i &apos;m saying is ,  please know ,  i &apos;m not here to create any false hope . 
well ,  i &apos;m following up on your daughter ,  mary ,  height; five four ,  weight; hundred ten pounds ,  brown eyes ,  blonde hair .   born april 24 ,  1976 .   missing june 11th ,  1992 .   a runaway ,  that &apos;s how she &apos;s listed .  is this information correct .  .  .   ? 
no . 
right ,  agent cole told me he &apos;d call and let you know to expect me .   he didn &apos;t call ? 
neil .  .  .  neil cole . 
what was the name .  .  .   ?  i &apos;ve got it here somewhere .  .  . 
these volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected ,  functioning hand in hand with law enforcement .  the r . c . m . p .  brought me in to review their investigations .  .  .    .  .  .  fact - check their records ,  see if there &apos;s anything they missed ,  anything they should be doing different .   i &apos;m here for a few days ,  before i head back up to virginia .  these reports go to the justice department eventually .   i spoke to your f . b . i .  contact a few days ago ,  uh .  .  . 
yes ,  but .  .  . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  let me explain ,  the r . c . m . p .  is a support organization and archive ,  not unlike the center for missing and exploited children in washington .   i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve dealt with them before ? 
i don &apos;t understand ,  who are .  .  .   ? 
i &apos;ve been hired as an independent contractor by the u . s .  resource center for missing persons as part of an internal audit .   if you have any time over the next few days ,  i &apos;d like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter . 
hello ,  mrs .  mathews ,  my name &apos;s thomas jones ,  i &apos;m a state licensed investigator .  .  . 
yes .  .  .   ? 
i &apos;ll do what i can . 
she was the kindest ,  sweetest girl you &apos;d ever want to meet .   oh ,  i adored her .   i supposed i always hoped she &apos;d be back .   after a time ,  all i could do was pray she had moved on to better things .   can you get this suitcase to her parents ,  if you think it &apos;s appropriate ? 
whatever possessed you to keep this all this time ? 
that &apos;s her suitcase .   i had forgotten it ,  till you showed me her picture . 
her belongings ? 
those are her belongings . 
what is this ? 
i &apos;m trying to find out .   she was a runaway .   i &apos;m looking into it for her parents . 
do you know what happened to her ? 
yes .   i remember her . 
you .  .  .  you do ?   you &apos;re sure ?  please ,  sister ,  will you take another look ,  make sure .  .  . 
yes .  .  .  i remember mary
certainly ,  senator .   if i can ever be of further assistance . 
yes ,  mister welles ,  thank you . 
the um .  .  .  you &apos;ll find my invoice in the envelope .  if that &apos;s all .  .  . 
he &apos;s an imbecile .   i tried to warn my daughter ,  but what can you do ? 
no ,  sir ,  he is not . 
none too discreet ,  is he ? 
your son - in - law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day ,  saw that woman every night .   the specifics are in the report ,  and information about the woman .   it &apos;s unpleasant ,  i know .   i apologize .  .  . 
certainly ,  sir . 
yeah ,  i know the spiel .   if you could bag it ,  i &apos;ll be on my way ,  thank you . 
i &apos;m required by state law to inform you that ,  while it &apos;s perfectly legal for you to purchase these items ,  it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of .  .  . 
okay .   fine . 
no ,  you may not . 
alright .   may i have your phone number ,  area code first ? 
cash . 
excellent .   we accept mastercard and american express . 
okay ,  i &apos;ll take it all . 
then we &apos;ll stay up together . 
figure it out ?  !  ?  !   i &apos;ll be insane before i figure it out .   the only thing i &apos;m sure of is that i can &apos;t go to sleep .   not while he &apos;s using me . 
we &apos;ll figure it out . 
i haven &apos;t slept much either .   since kristen .  .  . 
i can &apos;t go back to sleep again . 
yeah ,  or turn you into toast . 
it is .  .  . was .  it &apos;s a zapper ,  it might help me stay awake . 
hey ,  since when do you play thomas edison ?   this looks like sheila &apos;s . 
i can &apos;t find him . 
doesn &apos;t the dream master work for you anymore ? 
it was bad . 
i heard you screaming .   was it a bad one ? 
kristen .  .  . 
you alright ? 
what ? 
kincaid and joey died last night . 
what &apos;s wrong ? 
alice ,  you think you can leave ? 
never say can &apos;t .   just do what i do . 
rick .  .  . i can &apos;t . 
look ,  you gotta stand up for yourself .  learn to fight back . 
but she wouldn &apos;t let dad treat me like that . 
yeah .   she &apos;d be half as strict as you . 
i don &apos;t want to . 
the mirror .   you can &apos;t see yourself in it . 
what ? 
don &apos;t you think it kind of defeats the purpose ? 
you &apos;ll hear all kinds of stories .  they &apos;ll tell you it was murder ,  but it wasn &apos;t . 
kristen ,  what happened ? 
when i used to have nightmares .   i brought my friends in to help me .   until they all started dying . 
you what ? 
when they &apos;re all you have ,  you kinda become an expert . 
how &apos;d you learn so much about dreams ? 
i daydream .   you have to dream about some place fun .   remember you &apos;re in control . 
great ,  you wouldn &apos;t happen to know his phone number ? 
no really ,  it &apos;s a fable .   the  &apos;guardian of good &apos; dreams .   it was like my teddy bear when i was growing up . 
sounds like a game show host to me . 
my mom taught me when i was little .   did you ever hear of the dream master ? 
you could do worse . 
i love to dream ,  i just hate ones about my dad . 
yeah ,  i &apos;m not so sure . 
i &apos;m sure they &apos;re around . 
have you seen joey and kincaid !   god ,  i can &apos;t find them .   i can &apos;t find them anywhere . 
here you are .   where were you this morning ?   rick &apos;s looking all over for you . 
saw who ?  i was up all night cramming for this physics test ,  and i was putting this little baby together .   look .  .  . 
then you saw him ,  too ? 
that obvious ,  huh ? 
you &apos;ve been up all night ? 
what ? 
we have matching luggage . 
ohhhhbaby ,  i am dead on my feet . 
i know . 
maybe you shouldn &apos;t be working here so much .   you don &apos;t want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life . 
i know .   i hardly have any time to study . 
i gotta get to the library before it closes .   killer physics test . 
you in a hurry ? 
save it for later .   come on ! 
you look great ! 
debbie .   she &apos;s gone .   i &apos;ve .  .  . collected her ,  like the others . 
what the hell was that ? 
something &apos;s wrong here .   it feels like .  .  . 
here we are . 
you know ,  i get the weirdest feeling we &apos;ve been through this before . 
he &apos;s going after debbie .   i gotta stop him . 
it &apos;s okay ,  we &apos;re just about there . 
as long as your driving doesn &apos;t kill us . 
cut that shit out .   maybe before ,  but not now .  i want to help you .  i &apos;m on your side . 
you just feel sorry for me . 
hey ,  you &apos;re not alone .   we have to stop him ,  i &apos;m with you . 
he &apos;s going after debbie ,  i gotta stop him . 
who ? 
try what other kids did .   keep each other awake .   we &apos;ll meet at debbie &apos;s tonight .  at least if we don &apos;t sleep he can &apos;t get us . 
then what else can we do ? 
yeah ,  right .   let &apos;s trade death by freddy for life in a rubber room .   adults won &apos;t see it .  they can &apos;t . 
why can &apos;t we just talk to the authorities ? 
you don &apos;t really get it .   he &apos;s not a nightstalker .   it &apos;ll take more than bench presses to beat him . 
i don &apos;t think so .   i guess this is my own war . 
is there something we can do ? 
not really . 
kristen was the last child left of the people who killed freddy .   maybe freddy can &apos;t get to new kids without someone like me .   someone to bring them to him . 
alright ,  let &apos;s assume this whole thing is true .  why does freddy all of a sudden need you ? 
three days . 
how long have you been awake ? 
the story is ,  the deaths you can &apos;t argue with . 
no offense ,  or anything ,  but it &apos;s kind of hard to swallow . 
look ,  you know why ,  you just don &apos;t believe me . 
extra money ,  huh ? 
i &apos;ve been working double shifts . 
kristen &apos;s story really got to her . 
no ,  don &apos;t !   i gave sheila to him and now she &apos;s dead ! 
 &quot; in her dream &quot;  ? 
i was there in the dream .   he took her .  it was awful .   it was awful .  .  . 
it was no suicide .   it was not an accident .   it was freddy ,  and he &apos;s coming back for seconds ,  thirds ,  and fourths . 
i thought it was an accident .   smoking in bed . 
i know .   uh .  .  . alice . 
tell him i was looking for him ,  okay ?   i &apos;m dan . 
rick stayed later after school with kristen .   she wasn &apos;t feeling very well . 
you &apos;re his sister ,  right ? 
no .  .  . 
i saw it .  it was my dream .   i brought sheila in .  .  . 
enough of that crap . 
it was freddy . 
asthma attack .  .  . what 17 - year old has a fatal asthma attack ?   she was gonna be a doctor . 
give her time .   beauty is skin deep . 
i think sheila &apos;s more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them . 
alright ,  i think i see salvation .  .  . 
rick ,  please . 
what else ?   you ever look over this town &apos;s history ?   not a safe place to be a teenager .   anyway ,  if i &apos;m next ,  watch your back . 
about freddy ? 
she &apos;s blaming herself for sheila .   i know how it feels .   i &apos;ve been thinking about kristen .   maybe i could &apos;ve stopped it ,  if i &apos;d listened . 
how she doing ?   i ran into her last night . 
been up with alice . 
she knew she was gonna die . 
hey man ,  we &apos;re all sorry .  .  . 
now it gets weird .   she says he comes back in dreams .   if he kills you there ,  you &apos;re dead for real . 
nice neighborhood . 
it pissed off a lot of parents .  according to kristen ,  they hunted him down; roasted him alive . 
so ? 
she told us the story of freddy .   it &apos;s a town legend .   he was a child killer who was freed on a technicality . 
so what &apos;s up ?   what &apos;d i miss ? 
let me talk to you . 
i don &apos;t get it . 
excuse me ,  ladies .   i &apos;ll just be a moment . 
hey ,  rick ! 
earth to alice .  .  . 
t - t - thanks alice .  .  . 
mother ,  you &apos;ve just murdered me .   take that to your goddamn therapy .  .  . 
honey ,  we went over this in therapy . 
sorry !  !  sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who &apos;s now after me .  in case you haven &apos;t been keeping score ,  it &apos;s his fucking banquet ,  and i &apos;m the last course !  ! 
i &apos;m sorry honey ,  but .  .  . 
your distraught .   it &apos;ll help .  .  . 
what &apos;s wrong with me ? 
you &apos;re just tired .   don &apos;t think i haven &apos;t noticed your not sleeping .   that has to stop ,  honey . 
well mom ,  i &apos;ll tell ya ,  when two of your friends die the same day ,  you let me know what it does to your appetite . 
something the matter with the cuisine ? 
i told you you can &apos;t help .   this isn &apos;t a normal nightmare .  i &apos;m doomed . 
it &apos;s okay ,  babe .   we &apos;re with you . 
it &apos;s no just a house .  it &apos;s his home .  he &apos;s waiting there for me .  .  . to dream . 
i &apos;ll tell you later . 
it &apos;s no story .   it happened .   freddy &apos;s real and he &apos;s back . 
i though freddy was just an old town story . 
now you know who and what freddy really is . 
oh god !   he killed them ! 
what is it ? 
when dad &apos;s popping aspiring like popcorn ,  it &apos;s avoid - all - contact - day . 
what ? 
avoid - all - contact - day . 
something wrong with the stairs ? 
don &apos;t worry ,  honey
you don &apos;t get it ,  he &apos;s after me .  .  . 
you just stay put .   you need rest . 
i gotta get out of here . 
you had a nasty bump . 
yeah .   i guess so .  .  .  what happened ? 
feeling better now ? 
you &apos;re not taking my baby ! 
we know you &apos;ve been through a lot but there &apos;s more than your feelings at stake here . 
what are you talking about ?   my  &quot; condition &quot;  ?  .  .  . 
in your present condition ,  alice ,  we &apos;re worried about your ability  -  - 
and ours .   it &apos;s our grandchild . 
look ,  i appreciate what you &apos;re offering ,  but no .   he is my responsibility . 
what i what ?   well ,  i &apos;ve thought about it .   i plan to keep him . 
frankly ,  dear ,  we wondered what you intend to do with our baby ? 
it &apos;s okay ,  dan
excuse us ,  dear . 
he says it &apos;s easy .   especially with sad people .   with closed - off people . 
but how .  .  .  ? 
it &apos;s where he hides out .   inside .   that &apos;s how he found me . 
what do you mean ? 
he &apos;s inside you ,  where he hides . 
where is he ? 
come on downstairs .   he won &apos;t hurt you .  he needs us both . 
mommy .  .  .  ? 
my friend ,  with the funny hand . 
who says i don &apos;t like you ? 
who said i .  .  . wait ,  what ? 
no you &apos;re not .   you don &apos;t even care about being a mom .   how come you don &apos;t think about me ? 
oh .  .  . i &apos;m sure that &apos;s not true .   i &apos;ll bet she &apos;s very worried about you .   i would be . 
she doesn &apos;t want me around
i don &apos;t think this is a nice place for you to be .   maybe we should go find your mom . 
no .  .  . 
is that who you &apos;re waiting for ? 
been having bad dreams . 
hi ,  you don &apos;t look very well .   are you feeling all right ? 
i could tell you were sad .   i just wanted to see if you were all right . 
how did you know that ? 
i &apos;m sorry your boyfriend got killed . 
my name is .  .  . 
it &apos;s lonely in there ,  in my room . 
shouldn &apos;t you be in your room ,  jacob ? 
huh ? 
hey .  .  . wake up . 
me too . 
there you go .   love you . 
you &apos;re right . 
you don &apos;t dream him up ,  he can &apos;t hurt you .   or me .   or us .   remember .  .  . 
yeah .  .  . i guess . 
you stopped it didn &apos;t you ?   it was probably just a regular bad dream . 
no .   well ,  not exactly .  .  . it &apos;s that .  .  . i felt like i wasn &apos;t in control .   for the first time since .  .  . all that .   i &apos;m scared . 
about him ? 
he &apos;ll show up .   c &apos;mon ,  what &apos;s really wrong ? 
nothing .  .  . it &apos;s just .  .  . i didn &apos;t see my father at the ceremony . 
okay ,  babe .   what &apos;s the matter ? 
i know . 
they &apos;re coach seats ,  but the plane lands in paris .   it &apos;s gonna be a helluva summer ,  hon ! 
the tickets . 
sorry ,  babe . 
jesus !   don &apos;t do that ! 
hi ,  beautiful . 
now . 
but dad  -  - 
no !   i won &apos;t have you running around in the middle of the night .   you &apos;re coming home . 
i &apos;ve got to go . 
alice ! 
no ,  i &apos;m not .   i sort of hope it &apos;s a boy .  be nice to have a boy playing in the house again . 
you disappointed in me ? 
since my little girl became a mom .  .  . 
since when are you such a smart shopper ? 
alice .  .  . 
very funny . 
sobering .  .  . 
how was the meeting ? 
daddy ,  he &apos;s coming back .  .  . krueger &apos;s coming back .   make them understand . 
i &apos;m so sorry ,  honey .  .  . 
it &apos;s just across the park . 
you sure you don &apos;t want a ride to work ? 
thanks for everything ,  dad . 
to take a picture . 
where are we going ? 
it &apos;s the model you &apos;ve been saving up for .  i wanted you to have it for your trip . 
dad ! 
no .   a deal &apos;s a deal . 
that &apos;s in the past .   unless you &apos;ve stopped going to the meetings . 
i watched from behind the stands .   didn &apos;t want to embarrass you ,  ya know .    &quot; the drunk showed up &quot;  ,  that kind of thing .  .  . 
i was afraid you weren &apos;t coming . 
that &apos;s okay .   he &apos;s got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep . 
he sure loves to stay awake . 
so did dan . 
you do good work ,  alice . 
we &apos;ve got to go to the asylum and find her body .   mark said her soul &apos;s trapped with it  -  -  that &apos;s why she can &apos;t come to me .   it must be ! 
but how are we gonna  -  - 
jacob .   we &apos;ve got to get to amanda before it &apos;s too late . 
what ? 
if they actually bothered to bury her . 
you think that &apos;s the place she &apos;s buried ? 
yeah .  .  . so that &apos;s him .   and you &apos;re not crazy . 
are you alright ? 
that &apos;s the only reason you &apos;re alive .  .  . 
look .  .  . we &apos;re all tired .   none of us had any sleep since friday night .  .  . 
goddamn it ,  yvonne !   you don &apos;t just run away from this guy !   he finds you in your dreams . 
all i know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman .   why don &apos;t you take off  -  leave springwood and cool out somewhere for a while ? 
what do you think i &apos;m doing ?   look .   whether you believe it or not ,  krueger is back .   he &apos;s after the baby and if i don &apos;t try to do something about it ,  who will ?  ? 
and so is your baby .   you &apos;ve got more than just yourself to think of now ! 
krueger is reality . 
i am your friend ,  and i &apos;m worried sick about you .   but ,  you &apos;re like a locked safe .   you &apos;ve gotta start dealing with reality . 
i just can &apos;t figure out how he &apos;s getting in when i &apos;m awake .  .  . 
i really think you need to calm down now ,  okay ? 
mark knows i &apos;m not crazy .   ask him to show you his hands . 
oh ,  alice .  .  . no .   honey ,  i love you but you &apos;re going to have to get a hold of yourself .  .  . 
i think krueger &apos;s trying to do something to it . 
you had me scared on the phone .   what &apos;s wrong with the baby ? 
why don &apos;t you two stick to reality . 
i don &apos;t understand what &apos;s happening .  krueger has to use my dreams ,  but he got to dan and greta while i was awake .  how &apos;s he doing it ? 
no accident .   i tried to warn all of you about krueger . 
it was just an accident .   like with dan . 
when dan died you weren &apos;t even asleep .  you said so .   end of story . 
what &apos;s that got to do with it ? 
they &apos;re waiting for us .  .  . but let &apos;s keep this dream stuff between you and me . 
did everyone call everyone ? 
he must &apos;ve wandered up from the children &apos;s ward .   i just wondered what was wrong with him . 
there aren &apos;t any little boys on your floor . 
have you visited the little boy on my floor ?   jacob ,  the one who looks kind of sad ? 
alice ,  it &apos;s no dream .   i &apos;m sorry .  .  . dan &apos;s dead . 
it was no accident .   it was krueger .   he used to get in through my dreams ,  but not anymore .   he &apos;s found some other way . 
yeah ,  before they revoke his diploma . 
good to see you again ,  mr .  grey .   i &apos;ve got to go find dan . 
no ,  the dan part was nice .  .  . 
dan keeping you up again ?   put a lock on that window ,  girl . 
had kind of a long night . 
hey ,  what &apos;s wrong with you  -  -  let &apos;s see a smile . 
she killed herself .   her soul &apos;s gonna be in torment . 
i don &apos;t understand . 
no shit . 
poor woman .  .  . 
empty plot .   memorial stone .   vacant .  they never did put her under .   cool ,  huh ? 
but i &apos;ve seen her grave . 
they couldn &apos;t prove it .   no body !   nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business . 
meaning ? 
that &apos;s what the newspapers thought .   she spent the rest of her life in the asylum .  after krueger &apos;s trial she flipped out and hung herself ,  so they thought . 
no ,  it &apos;s our problem ,  mark .   if i don &apos;t deal with this ,  they really might try to take jacob .   you said she committed suicide ? 
that &apos;s their problem . 
they think i &apos;m nuts . 
then we &apos;ll find another way . 
i couldn &apos;t do that ,  mark .   he &apos;s my last link with dan .  .  . no ,  i want him . 
i &apos;m going to see what else i can find out about mr .  fred krueger
where are you going ? 
i don &apos;t know ! 
whoa ,  slow down .   how &apos;re you gonna hide from a guy like that ,  leave the planet ? 
what ,  you named it already ? 
my baby ! 
who &apos;s jacob ? 
why don &apos;t i go make some coffee .   there &apos;s a lot to tell . 
tell me some more about this krueger guy . 
it wasn &apos;t her mother .   the only reason we &apos;re still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party . 
maybe it was her mother who killed her ,  with all that polly perfect shit . 
nobody thinks that . 
do you think i &apos;m an idiot .  .  . for being in love with her ? 
mark ! 
then get out ! 
she must &apos;ve fallen asleep at the table .  .  . 
i thought about that . 
i &apos;m very fucking sorry ,  but greta is dead today .   could we interest you in someone else ? 
i want to talk to both you guys about greta .   and .  .  . 
yeah .   i &apos;m just aces . 
mark ,  are you okay ? 
that &apos;s why it &apos;s my fault dan &apos;s dead . 
i &apos;ve got to write some of this down . 
well we gotta do something ! 
my dad &apos;s got this thing about drinking in the house . 
greta ,  come on .   one burger with me ? 
not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis . 
i think i &apos;m starting to wear her down .   have some anyway . 
give up ,  mark ,  it &apos;s hopeless . 
i don &apos;t believe this .  .  .  all that gore you paint in the comics and you &apos;re squeamish ? 
oh man !   i could &apos;ve gone all night without looking at that . 
oh ,  he was this ancient guy i read about who like ,  killed his kids  &apos;cause they didn &apos;t want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should . 
who ? 
he &apos;s right .   sometimes i feel like i &apos;m living with melicertes . 
you know my mother  -  -  get real .   what about alice &apos;s ? 
that club sucks ,  they card everybody .  let &apos;s just party at your place . 
pimples ,  heartburn ,  cellulite .  .  .  and no modeling career . 
meet me later .   milkshakes .   cherry pie .  banana splits .   and no mom ! 
my undying love .   have some . 
next life .   oh ,  what &apos;s that ? 
yeah ,  when are you gonna come to your senses ? 
all of us .   right ? 
bottom line ,  alice .   anybody ,  supernatural or not ,  that wants to hurt you  -  he &apos;ll have to go through us first . 
pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy . 
look .   dan &apos;s parents were pushing him .  pushing him hard .   he was bitching about it at the party last night .   he was under pressure .   we all are . 
i want to talk about the baby . 
stop saying that ,  it &apos;s bullshit . 
nah .   it &apos;s getting too cold for me ,  and my wonderful mother will kill me if i screw up my hair .   she &apos;s got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night . 
naah ,  i &apos;m done .   got to be on shift in a couple hours .   aren &apos;t you going in ? 
have another one ,  sounds like you need it . 
that means they &apos;re gonna give me the key to the pool so i can lock up when i &apos;m done . 
yeah .  .  . 
all right kids ,  i tell you what we &apos;re gonna do .   i &apos;ve got swimming practice until six - thirty today .  .  . 
makes you look like a nun -  - 
these things are wild .  .  .   what do you think ? 
he invited me to his house last night . 
you ,  too ? 
stick around ,  please ? 
it &apos;s okay . 
i can &apos;t listen to this . 
i &apos;m not finished  -  i loved greta .   a lot .  and if maybe ,  just maybe ,  someone or some thing killed her ,  i &apos;d like to hear about it ! 
mark .  .  . 
why don &apos;t you shut up and let her talk !  two of us died in the last two days ,  does that strike you as particularly normal ?  ! 
faint . 
vomit ? 
two hours a day ,  six days a week . 
dan .   and he &apos;s taking alice with him  -  -  pretty good dive yvonne .   you &apos;ve been practicing . 
and his  &apos;egghead &apos; son !   we &apos;ll give  &apos;em a rough reception ,  won &apos;t we ? 
i wouldn &apos;t worry .   so long as we have boats like the tiger shark  -  and people like you ,  the skipper ,  dave ,  kent ,  sir ian and my father  - 
i don &apos;t know . 
but if they do ? 
maybe  -  just  &apos;maybe &apos;  -  when their ship doesn &apos;t return  -  they &apos;ll decide not to come here ,  after all . 
which is the one  -  we have to worry about ? 
yes ? 
they &apos;re so remote  -  cold  -  beautiful ,  the stars .   but now  -  i wonder  - 
i &apos;d sooner swim ! 
however our ideas disagree ,  as i &apos;ve said before ,  i &apos;m not a coward !   and it happens you &apos;ve got no choice :   either i take you down there ,  in the lungfish ,  or you don &apos;t get there  - 
 -  any more than being the son of captain neilsen does ! 
that &apos;s enough ,  holloway .   i &apos;ve told you before ,  wearing boards on your shoulders ,  and parading with a stiff spine doesn &apos;t auto -  matically endow you with back -  bone  -   ! 
then .  .  . this is a  &apos;flying saucer ?  &apos;
unidentified flying objects . 
you may not win them .   but without men like your father ,  to  &apos;degrade &apos; himself by fighting to preserve them  -  or as much as we have of them  -  they &apos;d have disappeared ,  long ago ! 
peace  -  the dignity of man  -  the destiny of the human spirit !   show me a man who says you win those by fighting wars ,  and i &apos;ll show you an idiot ! 
you mean nothing is worth fighting for ? 
perhaps .   but the idea of willingly going to school to spend my life at a paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder - lizards  -  i &apos;m referring to war  -  that strikes me as the worst cowardice of all  -  being spiritually yellow ! 
you &apos;re really a mixed - up oddball ,  aren &apos;t you ? 
that may be .   but dad stays where he is ,  and i &apos;m staying here ! 
we &apos;re all risking our lives ! 
wearing a uniform doesn &apos;t bestow an automatic monopoly on courage ,  commander !   it just so happens i &apos;m not a coward  -  physical or mental  -  and before i &apos;d risk my father &apos;s life .  .  . 
you said it .   but i won &apos;t argue  - 
you  &apos;trade school boys &apos; are all alike ,  aren &apos;t you ?   anybody who doesn &apos;t happen to think like a little gold - braided puppet is ,  ipso facto ,  a coward ! 
your father can be in nome ,  alaska ,  tomorrow .   we have two choices :  ask them to send him out in a  &apos;copter &apos; ,  and take you off ,  or the shark can put back into nome .  .  . 
what did you mean :   i &apos;m  &apos;out ?  &apos;
dead ?   matter of fact ,  he &apos;s much better .  he &apos;s left the hospital . 
my father !   he &apos;s not  -   ? 
your  &apos;out .  &apos;  this came for you .  
what is it ? 
not in two days .   look :   do you think i wanted to come ?   if it didn &apos;t mean so much to dad  -  proving his depth - explorer  -  it &apos;s the last thing i &apos;d want ! 
you could train someone else . 
and they thought you could re -  place the skipper ? 
it was moderate .   he &apos;ll be all right .   but it was out of the question ,  his coming along . 
how is he  -   ? 
it was supposed to be .   dad had a heart attack ,  two days ago . 
i should have suspectcd ,  when i heard that  &apos;doctor .  &apos;  i thought it was your father . 
what &apos;s goin &apos; on in here ,  lad ?  what  -   ? 
dave  -   ! 
oh it does ?  ?  ? 
here  -  keep these .   it wants me to come alone . 
i &apos;m with you ! 
well ? 
we &apos;ll have to look for them later . 
wonder where powell and carney are ? 
somewhere down there ? 
where do you think the voice you heard was coming from ? 
the sound again ? 
you hear that ? 
let &apos;s get back to work ,  and maybe we will be ,  soon . 
and if i didn &apos;t know better  -  i &apos;d swear we were moving ! 
you know  -  it is ? 
hey  -  you know somethin &apos; ?   it &apos;s getting lighter in here ! 
strange you didn &apos;t hear it .  omit 274f
i don &apos;t hear anything .   maybe you &apos;ve been down here too long .   why don &apos;t you go back up and  - 
listen !   hear that ? 
yeah ? 
go back and tell dr .  neilsen .  have him report to the skipper . 
i think you &apos;re right . 
what &apos;s more important  -  there &apos;s our problem .   the bow ram  -  the sawteeth are holding the shark in the break .  if we can cut the ram ,  the shark can pull herself loose ! 
how about that !  the bow drove half through her ,  but she sealed herself right up . 
not alone ,  you &apos;re not ! 
you all wait here .   i &apos;m going inside ,  take a look . 
reef and i can take the explorer down ,  clamp it around the eye ,  and  -  -  - 
 &apos;us ?  &apos;
you &apos;ve got to let us try ,  skipper  -  - 
skipper !   look at the depth gauge ! 
we &apos;re stuck tight ! 
sounds like it !   distress call ,  from a small freighter ,  between ellesmere island and greenland .  one mayday ,  then .  .  . nothing . 
cyclops ? 
 &apos;his &apos; side ?   i &apos;ve seen it ,  all right .  a nice ,  bright yellow ! 
have you ever talked to carl  -  tried to see his side ? 
but they &apos;re not skipper neilsen &apos;s son !   it broke his heart .   then when some newspapers called carl  &apos;the honest ,  sincere son of a war - mongering father &apos;  -  captain neilsen resigned from the navy .   oh ,  he still keeps his hand in  -  playing around with projects like the  &apos;lungfish &apos;  -  but it broke him ,  all the same . 
a lot of people think like that . 
so all of a sudden his only son drops out of school ,  be -  gins making noises like a pacifist .   a real egghead ,  do - gooder ,  and crackpot !    &apos;ban the atom tests !   junk the nuclear subs !   spend the mili -  tary budgetfor peace !  &apos;
so ? 
one of the finest men ,  and officers ,  alive .   a real hero  -  in the best sense of the word  -  in world war two .   he taught us engineering and design .  fought like a demon to develop atom subs . 
i guess . 
i guess skipper neilsen re -  tired before you enrolled at the academy ,  didn &apos;t he ? 
i might have a son like that ! 
huh ? 
you &apos;ve asked why i stay a bachelor ?  there goes the best reason i know ! 
disappointing a big girl ! 
what could be worse than disappoint -  ing a little girl ? 
that &apos;s the worst possible moment ? 
at the worst possible moment .  tomorrow is janie &apos;s birthday .  poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her daddy home .   now  - 
so they caught up with you ,  too ? 
reef ! 
helen .   i appeal to you  - 
but julie &apos;s a nice girl ,  and i &apos;ve seen you work .   she deserves a fighting chance ! 
now ,  dave old buddy ,  you know you &apos;re exaggerating  -   what do you think of this husband of yours ?   on most boats a certain loyalty exists between the exec and his navigation and firing officer .   but unfortunately ,  in the case of lieutenant dave milburn of the tiger shark and myself  - 
we hope ! 
sidearms ?   but the saucer &apos;s dead . 
with their underwater experience ,  they &apos;ll be invaluable .   take sidearms ,  and flare pistols  -  - 
the frogmen ? 
you better take powell and carney with you  -  - 
right at our one - eyed friend ! 
what course ,  skipper ? 
what ?  ?  ? 
a mass of jelly - like stuff came out of the thing ,  and caught our torpedo ! 
speed .  .  . about twenty - two knots .  course .  .  . due north ! 
course and speed ? 
i .  .  . don &apos;t know ! 
what about down ? 
seems to be all around .  .  . 
is there any way out of it ? 
right ,  skipper . 
get ready .   we shove off as soon as griff reports all the crew aboard . 
what ?  ?  ?  ? 
we &apos;re dead in the water .   but it indicates we &apos;re moving ! 
why do you say that ? 
the inertial navigation system .  must have been knocked out in the crash . 
something wrong ? 
skipper  -  could you take a look here .  .  .  ? 
all internal repairs completed ,  and frogmen report exterior damage minor . 
yes ,  griff ? 
excuse me ,  skipper -  -  - 
what about time .  .  .  ? 
it &apos;s possible i could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the icbm  -  so it would  &apos;home &apos; on the saucer when he rises from the pole . 
anything  -  -  - 
excuse me ,  captain  -  there may be one last ,  desperate chance  -  a one - in - a - thousand shot .  .  . 
radiation level .  .  . constantly rising .  .  . 
now they feel it .  .  . down below . 
that &apos;s wonderful ,  carl !   reef thinks they can clear the shark bow so we can pull ourself loose ! 
wonderful ! 
we read you !   go ahead ,  doctor !   they &apos;re inside the saucer .   it &apos;s filled with breathable air ! 
as ready as we can be !   i &apos;ll report to the skipper . 
all ready ? 
there is .   i believe our friend .  .  . cyclops .  .  .  is returning to life ! 
there &apos;s got to be an explanation ! 
as we near the pole .  .  . 
what direction does the system indicate ? 
the radiation level  -  from the saucer  -  it &apos;s rising ! 
if we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted .  .  .  . 
 .  .  .  . in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and ,  as you put it .  .  .  .    .  .  .  &apos;recharging his batteries &apos; ? 
the north pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all  -  the earth itself ! 
we harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force .   maybe cyclops does it on a super scale .  .  .  . 
we took for granted his source of energy was nuclear .   but suppose it isn &apos;t at all  -  what if it &apos;s magnetic ? 
what if the tiger shark were to anticipate a bit ?   perhaps be lying there waiting  -   ? 
suppose our theorizing is correct ?  then this could be the next danger point ! 
 .  .  . above murmansk ,  and finland . 
high - intensity arcs will burn ,  submerged .   and millions of volts .  .  . discharged in random directions .  .  . 
under water ? 
it doesn &apos;t seem possible ,  but  -  could it be an electrical storm center  -   ? 
minus three . 
what &apos;s the corrected bearing to the magnetic pole ? 
nothing we can do ,  now . 
straight to the pole  -  at almost fifty knots ! 
if we could get inside the saucer  -  use our torches  -  maybe we could cut the shark loose ? 
what ? 
suppose there &apos;s an atmosphere ,  of some kind ,  inside cyclops ? 
and we &apos;re at safe maximum depth already .  .  .  .   stop engines ! 
it &apos;s the screws ,  skipper .   at our declination angle ,  running in reverse ,  they &apos;re pulling the shark and cyclops right to the bottom . 
a hundred and eighty fathoms !  we can &apos;t be sinking that fast .  .  .  . 
we can ram him ! 
but  -  what can we accomplish ? 
that &apos;s what i said ! 
right at him ? 
thirty - four seconds ! 
what &apos;s the running time ? 
take a look . 
you &apos;re sure it &apos;s cyclops ? 
after torpedo room :   report ! 
determine extent of damage ,  immediately . 
i think i should have joined the air force ! 
what do you think ? 
it &apos;ll be all right .   we &apos;re old friends ! 
huh ? 
 &apos;doctor &apos; neilsen ?   when did that happen ? 
dr .  neilsen .   he &apos;ll be  -   - 
who with ? 
i &apos;m  -  afraid i have some bad news for you ,  reef  -   you &apos;ll have to share quarters ,  this trip . 
i met dr .  kent ,  once . 
i did go .   just back .   reef ,  these are a couple of our passengers  -  sir ian hunt ,  and dr .  clifford kent .   my exec ,  commander richard holloway . 
thought you were going to washington ,  skipper . 
that might be a little rough ! 
obviously . 
to navigate ,  won &apos;t you have to .  .  .  see your way ? 
of course .   but it is time to be -  gin the return voyage  -  - 
that &apos;s why no water leaked inside when we rammed you ? 
it is a living thing .   when damaged  -  you would say  &apos;wounded &apos;  -  it immediately  &apos;heals &apos; itself . 
i have selected you ,  to return with me  -  along with several other specimens ,  for study .   we will examine you and the others ,  discover desirable features to incorporate in our  &apos;earth - colonizers .  &apos;
why ? 
on the contrary .   i want you  -  unharmed  -  perfect . 
why not me ?   what am i  -  the closing act ? 
i am afraid not .   therefore  - 
he did ! 
your friend was to remain where he was ! 
swell ! 
 -  for horrors like yourself ? 
my mission is to study various solar systems ,  and planets  -  select the most suitable for colonization  - 
tell me something :   why can i hear you ,  when the others couldn &apos;t ? 
point of view is everything .  to us ,  your form of life is ugly as we appear to you . 
that &apos;s a face ?  ?  ? 
come where ? 
remove your weapons ,  commander .  and come here  -  alone ! 
all right  -  go to it . 
cyclops will have to linger at the pole to recharge his power banks . 
toward the pole ! 
due north .   at five knots .  .  . no ,  six ! 
but answers are what we need  -  not more questions ! 
we &apos;ve asked ourselves that  -  over and over  -  a thousand times . 
or ,  perhaps ,  until he gets us ? 
you plotted the course of cyclops ?   then that &apos;s our course !   wherever he goes ,  we go .  .  .  .  . until we get him ! 
our  &apos;cyclops &apos; throws quite a thunderbolt ,  itself ! 
just musing about our  &apos;one - eyed adversary &apos; and the legend of homer .    &apos;cyclopes &apos; were the sons of heaven ,  who forged the thunder -  bolts thrown by zeus . 
i &apos;ll be another ! 
well ,  i &apos;ll be  -   ! 
the pattern .   each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the pole .   a line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle .  .  . 
see what ? 
thank you . 
my yeoman will show you to your quarters . 
all the figures show is that gordon lariviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as selectman .  in a year or two ,  you won &apos;t recognize this town . 
he musta found out .  they had to get rid of him .  and jack &apos;ll get blamed . 
no . 
twombley involved ? 
i went down to concord to check it out .  the president is mel gordon .  the vice - president and treasurer is gordon lariviere .  those boys are buying up the mountain ,  wade .  $364 , 000 this year .  i believe that &apos;s out of lariviere &apos;s league . 
what is the northcountry development association ? 
this is from three years ago .  some difference ,  huh ? 
as a mater of fact ,  yes .  lariviere . 
has anybody offered to buy it ? 
i know he &apos;s due for the last two years .  i was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in . 
about jack ?  no .  have you checked out the tax bill on your father &apos;s farm lately ? 
you don &apos;t believe me ? 
sometimes things are simpler than you think .  let me ask you a question . 
 .  .  . if jack told the truth ,  he could be free by the time he &apos;s my age . 
you know jack hewitt ,  the kid i work with ? 
who ? 
evan twombley ,  the union boss who got shot .  somebody murdered him . 
who ? 
this is maybe worse than you and i are used to .   what i &apos;m talking about ,  i &apos;m talking about murder .  among other things . 
always has been . 
alma ,  i think there &apos;s some dirty business going on in this town . 
well ,  you look .  .  .  sad .  upset .  i don &apos;t mean to pry .  i &apos;m sorry about your mother .  it was a nice funeral . 
yeah ,  sure .  why ?  i got this damned tooth ,  i got a few things bugging me ,  like everybody else .  but i &apos;m okay . 
are you alright ,  wade ? 
no .  black . 
been putting my files into it .  you take sugar and milk ? 
you got yourself a computer ,  alma . 
he &apos;s a selectman .  the town .  he said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office .  i &apos;m supposed to pull the cb and police light out of your car .  they &apos;re town property . 
he can &apos;t fire me .  lariviere already did that this morning . 
chub says you &apos;re fired . 
tell me . 
lariviere says he ain &apos;t gonna pay for the fixin &apos; of your car .  a couple hundred for the clutch .  i got some more bad news .  wanna hear it ? 
yeah .  i know about that . 
 -  -  the bad news is there &apos;s a problem with gordon &apos;s truck what somebody drove through the ice last night .  figured you &apos;d know something about that ,  wade . 
just tell me when you &apos;ll have it fixed . 
the good news is we haven &apos;t got to your car yet .  the bad news  -  - 
same old shit . 
what are you boys up to ? 
yeah .  i know .  the custody suit thing was just my getting back at her .  i &apos;m not as dumb as i look .  whatever you say .  i love my daughter .   i &apos;ll send you the five hundred . 
you might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the  -  - 
oh . 
hard to say .  if we go for custody ,  depositions ,  psychiatric evaluations ,  it could drag on .  ten or twelve thousand dollars .  she could win on appeal .  if we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn ,  assuming they &apos;re unduly restrictive ,  it wouldn &apos;t be more than twenty - five hundred . 
jesus .  how much .  .  .  how much will the whole thing cost ? 
fine .  i &apos;ll need a $500 retainer .  you can mail it . 
yes . 
no ,  not exactly .  i &apos;ll look at the divorce decree ,  see if we can get it redrawn .  interview your daughter .  jill ,  right ? 
it looks pretty hopeless ,  don &apos;t it ? 
good .  it would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex - wife .  sexual problems upsetting to the child . 
this spring . 
how soon ? 
i plan to .  soon . 
it would help if you were married ,  if there was someone at home while you work . 
i screwed up the divorce .  i agreed with everything she said .  i wanted her to like me .  i just want to be a good father . 
that was me . 
we bought you . 
you can &apos;t buy wade off . 
maybe i can buy him off .  i gotta talk to mel . 
shit !  what are we gonna do ? 
he &apos;s on to us ! 
no ,  of course not .  just say it ,  that &apos;s all . 
lawyer ?  i don &apos;t need no lawyer ,  do i ? 
you &apos;ll get your money .  don &apos;t talk to any newspapers about this .  twombley &apos;s a big deal down in massachusetts ,  you know .  tell them your lawyer says you shouldn &apos;t comment . 
not exactly .  i mean ,  he never paid me . 
might as well take the rest of the day off .  you look sort of fucked up .  you &apos;ve been paid for the day ,  anyhow ,  right ? 
this is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up .  twombley &apos;s son - in - law and daughter are up the weekend .  didn &apos;t you say you &apos;d seen him ,  wade ? 
nope .  heard it .  we wasn &apos;t far apart .  i spotted this buck ,  then i heard the gun go off and twombley was gone .  i looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was ,  deader &apos;n shit .  called it right in . 
you see it ? 
yeah . 
i hear twombley got shot . 
you heard the news . 
you only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks . 
fresh tracks .   deer shit .  big one .  here &apos;s your buck ,  mr .  twombley .  i &apos;ll circle around . 
deers have ears too . 
sun &apos;s gettin high . 
this way . 
yeah . 
safety on ? 
ruined my arm .  brought me along too fast .  why &apos;d it have to be my fucking arm ,  i used to think .  then i realized it had to be somebody &apos;s fucking arm . 
what happened ? 
the only difference between me and that clemens on tv is luck ,  shit luck . 
hmm . 
they said . 
really . 
pitcher .   &quot; best ballplayer to come out of new hampshire since carlton fisk .  &quot; 
oh . 
double a .  new britain . 
you played for the sox ? 
drafted by the red sox . 
yeah ? 
i used to play ball . 
follow close .  we &apos;ll cross the next meadow . 
i &apos;m okay . 
wonderful ! 
and you &apos;ll get your extra hundred bucks . 
i get it .   no sweat .  you &apos;ll get yourself a deer and you &apos;ll get him dead .  and you &apos;ll have him by coffee time . 
you understand what i &apos;m saying ?  i want a deer ,  a dead one ,  not a cripple or whatthefuck . 
mmm . 
you take care of your end ,  kid ,  i &apos;ll take care of mine . 
you might gut - shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag .  can &apos;t guarantee that won &apos;t happen ,  especially with a new gun .  i may have to shoot it . 
you think so . 
you might not kill it . 
yeah . 
if you get it ? 
tell you what .  you get me close to a big buck by ten ,  kid ,  there &apos;s another hundred bucks in it . 
done much shooting with that rifle yet ? 
damn straight ! 
yep .  right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles .  the bucks are right behind them and we &apos;re right behind the bucks .   this gun gets fired before ten o &apos;clock .  whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you .  i &apos;ll put you inside 30 ,  35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season .  that &apos;s what you &apos;re paying me for ,  ain &apos;t it ? 
guaranteed ,  eh ? 
don &apos;t worry ,  mr .  twombley ,  i know where those suckers are .  rain or shine ,  snow or no snow .  i know deer .  we &apos;ll kill us a buck today .  guaranteed .  before ten . 
it &apos;s not enough snow ,  not for tracking the bastards .  no advantage there ,  kid . 
what do you mean i got money ?  i &apos;m as broke as you . 
i mean it  -  -  you got enough money now .  head out for california .  surf &apos;s up ,  jack ,  and you &apos;re digging wells in the snow . 
open the door .  we &apos;re late . 
why don &apos;t you quit now ,  you want out so bad ? 
open the door ,  will ya ? 
out of this fucking job .  this job sucks .  working outside in the winter sucks . 
lawford ? 
i &apos;m fucking out of here . 
he sure as hell won &apos;t . 
twombley sure as hell won &apos;t be shooting it again . 
yeah . 
there &apos;s your old twenty - gauge ,  and that there &apos;s the new browning you was showing me last night .  this must be twombley &apos;s gun .  brand new .  very fancy tooling .  probably fired one time .  it &apos;s a beautiful piece of work .   but what the hell ,  jack ,  i guess you deserve it .  right &apos;s right . 
let &apos;s get the fuck outta here .  you &apos;re not making any sense ,  man . 
you musta seen him get shot .  i know you did . 
what the fuck you telling me ,  wade ?  i never seen the guy get shot ,  i told you that . 
saw him do it ? 
what ? 
sure you did . 
well ,  i didn &apos;t actually see him do it .  like i said . 
i never seen a man shot before .  not even in the service .  must be something . 
who the fuck knows ?  musta slipped or something .  i just heard the gun go off . 
i gotta make a report to fish and game .  i was just wondering ,  that &apos;s all .  what &apos;d he do ,  to shoot himself ,  i mean ? 
musta .  .  .  how &apos;d i know ?  what &apos;re you doing ,  playing cop ? 
on your sleeve . 
what blood ? 
where &apos;d you get the blood ? 
yeah . 
you stayed away ? 
the ambulance guys lugged him up . 
you bring him up yourself ?  that &apos;s a steep climb . 
a half mile in ,  along the old lumber road . 
no ,  i mean whereabouts . 
in the chest . 
where &apos;d twombley get shot ? 
piece of fucking cake . 
aw ,  shit ,  she &apos;s here to get jill .  me and jill had a little argument .  jack ,  i got to get back ,  get back to town .  move this thing ,  will you ?  see if you can get back to the town hall before they get there ,  okay ? 
shit . 
bastard &apos;s got his high beams on . 
right ! 
yeah ,  he &apos;d go broke tomorrow if you quit him . 
right .  the sonofabitch couldn &apos;t get along without me . 
like you and gordon ? 
gordon ,  he &apos;s always got some angle working .  he wants to keep twombley happy ,  i &apos;m his boy . 
how &apos;d you get the job ? 
don &apos;t know about lucky .  the guy &apos;s a full - blown asshole .  pay &apos;s good ,  though .  $100 a day .  i got to guarantee a kill ,  of course .  which i can do .  there &apos;s some monster bucks hiding out up there . 
evan .  he &apos;s a mucky - muck union official from massachusetts .  you &apos;re lucky . 
got a job first thing in the morning ,  first day of season .  saturday i &apos;ll hunt for myself .  twombley something .   -  er  -  - 
not here . 
some job .  here ,  have a hit .  don &apos;t be such a hardass .  i know you got problems ,  but everybody &apos;s got problems .  
you gotta be more careful about that shit .  gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they &apos;ll expect me to bust you .  and i &apos;ll be outta a job . 
relax ,  chief .  we &apos;re leaving .  you wanna toke ? 
i thought i told you to move that truck ! 
got you for  -  -  450 ,  500 bucks ?  
no brag .  just fact . 
where &apos;s that gun you were bragging on today ? 
lariviere &apos;s having a hell of a time in there .  master of fucking ceremonies . 
don &apos;t mind if i do . 
okay ,  let &apos;s go home ,  then . 
i want to go home . 
jill ,  please ,  it &apos;s alright .  nothing happened . 
oh . 
nope .  not anymore .  i &apos;m nothing anymore . 
you &apos;re a policeman . 
i know . 
that &apos;s illegal ,  you know . 
you can &apos;t . 
i want to go home . 
i don &apos;t know .  for the food business .  i guess .  i just thought ,  you know ,  we &apos;d sneak a big mac on mommy ,  like we used to . 
what are you sorry for ? 
please don &apos;t cry .  please ,  honey . 
fine . 
okay . 
nothing ,  i guess .  i guess i can wait till we get home .  maybe we &apos;ll stop by wickham &apos;s for a hamburger when we get to lawford .  that suit you ?  you always like wickham &apos;s . 
okay .  so we &apos;ll get what you want .  what do you want ? 
i know what mommy says .  i &apos;m in charge today ,  though . 
same thing ,  daddy .  mommy says  -  - 
you can &apos;t have nothing ,  jill .  we need lunch .  mr .  pizza ? 
nothing . 
what do you want ,  then ? 
no . 
c &apos;mon ,  we can always sneak a big mac .  and a cherry turnover .  your favorite .  what do you say ? 
mommy won &apos;t let me eat fast food .  you know that .  it &apos;s bad for you . 
how about a big mac ? 
oh . 
grandpa .  my father .  it &apos;s his . 
pop ? 
it belongs to pop . 
it &apos;s pretty old . 
yeah .  my car &apos;s in the shop .  this &apos;ll be fine . 
are we going in this ? 
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .  can you stay for a while ? 
dad . 
that &apos;s fine with me too .  when mommy comes ,  tell her i &apos;m up here . 
sit right there by yourself if you want .  wait for her by yourself .  that &apos;s fine with me .  just dandy .  i &apos;m going downstairs . 
where do you expect to wait for her ?  obviously downstairs with the other kids isn &apos;t good enough . 
yes . 
she won &apos;t be here for a half hour .  think you can stand it that long ? 
yes . 
that &apos;s all you got to say ?   &quot; yes &quot;  . 
yes . 
she &apos;s gone already !   gone already !  couldn &apos;t wait . 
well ,  i guess i am .  i planned this ,  i planned all this ,  you know .  i mean ,  it &apos;s sort of pathetic ,  but i planned it .  you shouldn &apos;t have called your mother .   c &apos;mon ,  we &apos;re gonna call her before she leaves . 
i told her i wanted to come home .  daddy ,  don &apos;t be mad at me . 
yeah .  yeah ,  right ,  i &apos;m mad .  what &apos;d you tell her ,  for christ sake ? 
see ,  i knew you &apos;d be mad . 
come and get you !  shit !  it &apos;s a damn half hour drive each way .  why didn &apos;t you talk to me about it first ? 
i .  .  .  because i want to go home .  she said she &apos;d come and get me . 
jesus ,  why ? 
yes . 
what ?  you called mommy ?  just now ? 
i called mommy . 
jesus .  listen ,  jill ,  tell you what .  tomorrow morning ,  you still want to go home ,  i &apos;ll drive you down .  i &apos;ll get off work or something . 
i don &apos;t want to be here .  don &apos;t worry ,  i love you ,  daddy ,  i do .  but i want to go home . 
you are home .  there are lots of kids you still know here . 
no i didn &apos;t see anybody i know .  no i don &apos;t want to go to school here tomorrow .  i want to go home . 
no what ? 
no . 
some party ,  huh ?  sorry i lost sight of you .  i had to step outside for a smoke .  you find anybody you know here ?  there must be some kids you used to know from school .  you want to go tomorrow ?  see your old teachers ?  be more fun than hanging out with me all day . 
oh ,  jesus ,  come on ,  will you ?  don &apos;t mess this up anymore than it &apos;s already been messed up .  join the other kids .  do that and before you know it you &apos;ll be as happy as a goddamned clam . 
i want to go home .   i don &apos;t like it here . 
it &apos;s fun . 
it &apos;s stupid . 
what then ? 
it &apos;s not that . 
why ?  why not ?  you know these kids from when you went to school here .  it hasn &apos;t been that long . 
i don &apos;t want to . 
go on ,  jill .  some of those kids you still know . 
no .  she doesn &apos;t talk about you anymore . 
no .  i didn &apos;t used to be bad .  no sir .  where do you get this stuff ?  from your mother ? 
i just think you used to be bad . 
what are you talking about ? 
i bet you did lots of bad things . 
it &apos;s not funny now .  i &apos;m a cop and i gotta listen to all the complaints people make .  i &apos;m not a kid anymore .  you change . 
but it &apos;s not funny now . 
to us it was . 
was it funny ? 
well ,  yeah .  sort of .  nothing really mean .  me and my pals ,  me and my brothers .  it was kind of funny then .  stealing pumpkins ,  soaping windows .  stuff like that . 
did you do that when you were a kid ? 
i guess they &apos;re stupid . 
yeah .  it &apos;s stupid . 
break stuff ? 
you know . 
do what ? 
why do they do that ? 
can &apos;t you see .  .  .  look out there .  nobody &apos;s got their porch lights on anymore .  it &apos;s too late .  those hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble .  see ,  they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there .  they chopped down herb crane &apos;s new bushes .  little bastards .  jesus h .  christ . 
i don &apos;t care .  they &apos;re out . 
those are the hoyts . 
look .  those kids are still trick - or -  treating .  they &apos;re still out . 
yeah . 
who &apos;s fault is it then if it &apos;s not yours ?  you &apos;re the one in charge ,  daddy . 
i &apos;m sorry for the screw - up .  but i couldn &apos;t help it it &apos;s too late to go trick - or - treating now .  i couldn &apos;t help it i had to stop at penny &apos;s for the costume .  and you were hungry ,  remember . 
yeah ,  you can have the key .  it &apos;s the key that &apos;s kept me locked to you all these years .  i give it to you with pleasure .   now i &apos;m free .  see how easy it is ,  jack ?  all you got to do is give back what the man gave you ,  and you &apos;re free of him .   i &apos;ve got to call my brother . 
the key ,  wade . 
you two ,  don &apos;t you get it ?  he &apos;s using you .  you &apos;re his slaves .   jesus christ ,  jack ,  don &apos;t you see that ? 
wade ,  you &apos;re done .   let me have the shop keys . 
always count on old wade for a good screwing .  why should i always pay more ,  sell cheap ?  why should you guys make all the money .  you and mel and jack .  right &apos;s right . 
could be . 
you and mel gordon ? 
maybe . 
i won &apos;t .  you interested ? 
don &apos;t light that in here .  i &apos;m allergic . 
want to buy ? 
what &apos;s the difference ?  take my truck ,  take a rest  -  -  stop worrying about mel gordon .  have you decided what to do with your old man &apos;s place  -  -  he going to stay there ? 
that was before twombley was shot .  before he knew . 
mel &apos;s doing some business with me .  it &apos;s nice to do favors for people you do business with .  he was in a hurry .  no big deal . 
you ?  why ? 
wade ,  that wasn &apos;t smart .  going out right after the man &apos;s father - in - law shot himself .  let it go .  call it a favor to me . 
he say anything about the summons i tried to give him ?  sonofabitch wouldn &apos;t accept it . 
so ? 
i saw mel gordon in here this morning . 
nothing ,  wade ,  i &apos;ve been thinking .  you don &apos;t get enough appreciation around here and it &apos;s time we changed things a little . 
what do i have to do for it ? 
elaine !  call chub meritt and have him pick up wade &apos;s car ,  fix the clutch . 
on what you pay me ? 
you ever think of getting a new car ,  wade ? 
sorry about the long lunch .  my clutch is going out again . 
you rolfe ?   i remember you from high school .  you &apos;re a teacher now ?  harvard ? 
i &apos;m fine ,  fine . 
how you holding up ,  wade ? 
well ,  right now we &apos;re not too interested .  finish up what you gotta do ,  then you can get bugged on your own time . 
yeah .  a few things . 
something bugging you ? 
it ain &apos;t done ,  if that &apos;s what you mean . 
what the fuck .  my day &apos;s already ruined .   give me the keys .  you can go back with jack .  you still got a shitload of plowing to do . 
let &apos;s get to the top and talk to jack first .  he &apos;ll know what happened .  he fucking better .  if this coulda been avoided ,  i &apos;ll put that kid &apos;s ass in a sling . 
you want me to follow them to littleton ? 
that must &apos;ve been twombley .  jesus .  i bet that was twombley . 
like hell . 
you ain &apos;t the hunter jack is .  and he can &apos;t drive the grader worth shit . 
i wish you had .  i &apos;d rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader . 
i shoulda sent you instead of jack . 
he more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something .  that &apos;s what usually happens . 
yes ,  wade ,  i mean twombley .  put out that cigarette .  fuck .  fuck .  fuck . 
you mean twombley ? 
fuck .  you don &apos;t know how bad or anything ? 
twombley &apos;s shot .  i heard that .  not jack .  he &apos;s okay ,  i assume . 
fuck .  turn it off .   all you heard was there was some kinda accident ? 
twombley ,  jesus .  we got to get moving :  i got to get up there .  how would i know ?  c &apos;mon ,  you drive .  we &apos;ll take my truck . 
i figured you already heard . 
huh ? 
a hunting accident .  jack and twombley . 
what &apos;s the hurry ? 
that &apos;s what i love about a small town .  you know everybody . 
fuck you . 
get the grader .  go out 29 past toby &apos;s .  don &apos;t let lillian get to you .  she didn &apos;t belong here .  that &apos;s why she left . 
i &apos;m not saying that . 
you don &apos;t want the extra police pay ? 
what am i  -  -  a security guard ?  you hired me ,  you and your selectman friends . 
don &apos;t go playing policeman . 
at the school crossing .  in his bmw .  coulda hurt some kids .  i &apos;m gonna bust his ass . 
huh ? 
his son - in - law damn near killed me . 
jimmy took it .  jack &apos;s out hunting with evan twombley . 
where &apos;s the plow ? 
told you the snow was coming down .  take the grader . 
watch this snow .  it &apos;s coming down tonight . 
tomorrow ,  gordon . 
got here just in time .  go ahead .  jump in line .  maybe you &apos;ll win a prize . 
we &apos;re looking for the funniest costume !  and the scariest !  and the most imaginative !  and the best costume of all ! 
you know what i &apos;m talking about .  for what you &apos;re doing to me and to the child you say you love so much .  love .  you won &apos;t get away with it . 
low as what ?  what have i done ?  it &apos;s bad to want to see your own daughter ? 
you make me sick .  i can &apos;t believe you &apos;ve sunk so low . 
no problem .  look ,  i .  .  . 
hi honey . 
see .  get your boots . 
yeah ,  lots . 
wait there .  she &apos;ll be right out .   is there snow on the ground up in lawford ? 
let the past be .   i &apos;m sorry about your mother .  i liked her .  you never know how much women like that suffer .  it &apos;s like they live their lives with the sound turned off  -  -  and then they &apos;re gone . 
it &apos;s just .  .  . 
we &apos;ve done all our talking ,  wade . 
we should talk . 
no ,  not anymore .  it &apos;s too .  .  .  it &apos;s too far . 
you ever come to your father &apos;s grave anymore ? 
i &apos;m not making it any worse .  you are .  me and jill could &apos;ve worked this thing out .  it &apos;s normal ,  it &apos;s even normal for me to get a little touchy about it .  believe it or not .  how do you think this makes me look ,  treating her like some tragic victim or something ? 
don &apos;t cause a scene .  no one &apos;s trying to win any  &apos;rounds &apos; .  don &apos;t make it any worse . 
i don &apos;t want her to go ,  lillian . 
oh ,  jesus ,  lay off ,  will you ?  it looks like you &apos;ve won this fucking round already ,  so lay off a little ,  for christ &apos;s sake . 
she &apos;s grown up some ,  hasn &apos;t she ? 
yeah . 
while you went off for a few beers with your friends ?  is that hettie rodgers there ,  with whatzizname ? 
where is she now ?  is she in the truck with your friends ? 
me and jill ,  we just had a little spat .  she felt kind of left out ,  i guess ,  from not knowing some of the new kids  -  - 
where &apos;s jill ? 
lillian ! 
from boston .  evan twombley &apos;s son - in -  law  -  -  he was driving .  i know where they &apos;re headed .  up the lake ,  agaway .  the old man &apos;s out deer hunting with jack hewitt ,  so they probably got some big weekend party planned . 
i still don &apos;t understand  -  - 
mel gordon . 
good .  who ? 
i know who it is . 
did you get his number ? 
did you see that sonofabitch in the bmw ?  he could &apos;ve killed somebody . 
are you okay ,  wade ?  what was wrong ?  why were you holding everyone up ? 
don &apos;t be silly .  hi ,  jill . 
don &apos;t lie to me .  you &apos;re leaving me ,  i can see that . 
i &apos;m just cleaning out some of this stuff that &apos;s built up .  for the rummage sale .  and some things for the cleaners .  and the laundromat . 
going somewhere ,  margie ? 
look ,  that &apos;s temporary ,  believe me .  there &apos;s so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days ,  my getting fired by lariviere and merritt won &apos;t matter a bit . 
i heard you talking .  you got fired this morning ,  didn &apos;t you ? 
it &apos;s my tooth !  my fucking tooth !  i can &apos;t even think anymore because of it . 
what on earth is happening to you ?  why are you acting this way ? 
jesus christ ,  pop ,  let &apos;s go home .  i got waylaid .  sorry . 
what happened ? 
wade . 
this is nuts . 
i don &apos;t know for christ &apos;s sake ! 
how ? 
of course !  i would &apos;ve heard . 
think they &apos;re alright ? 
strange . 
the truck &apos;s here .  looks like they &apos;ve stayed inside since the snow started . 
are you sure they &apos;re home ?  did you call ? 
i just want to pick up my divorce papers .  for the lawyer .  it won &apos;t take long . 
i know your parents . 
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents ? 
did you tell them ?   that we were coming ? 
good . 
alright .  i &apos;ll think about it . 
it was to the same woman .  i was just a kid .  .  .   it &apos;s not like a marriage proposal or anything ,  just a thought .  something for you and me to talk about and think about .  you know ? 
you &apos;ve been married twice  -  - 
i &apos;ve been thinking about it ,  that &apos;s all . 
oh ,  wade . 
there &apos;s another thing i &apos;ve been thinking about .  i don &apos;t know how you feel about the idea ,  margie ,  because we &apos;ve never talked about it .  but i &apos;ve been thinking lately ,  i &apos;ve been thinking we should get married sometime .  you and me . 
then .  .  .  i guess you have to . 
i &apos;m her father  -  -  supposed to be ,  but i &apos;m not able to .  yes .  yes ,  i am .  it may be the only thing in my life i &apos;ve been so clear about wanting .  even if it takes a big fight . 
don &apos;t you think ,  do you still think it &apos;s a good idea to press this custody thing  -  -  just now ? 
it &apos;s nice . 
after making love .  i like it .  it &apos;s nice to see that in a grown - up person . 
what way ? 
yeah ,  but never what you looked like .  not really .  never really studied your face ,  like now .  i was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now ,  this way . 
you knew me as a kid . 
i can see what you looked like as a kid . 
but not now . 
no .  not for money .  but ,  if somebody &apos;d given me half a damned excuse  -  -  i was pretty fucked up ,  you know . 
you wouldn &apos;t have done anything like that ,  shot someone for money . 
no ,  i just know jack &apos;s lying about what happened .  he just seemed  -  -  i know that kid ,  what he &apos;s like inside .  he &apos;s a lot like i was at his age . 
the mafia hire jack hewitt ? 
lots of people .  guy like evan twombley ,  boston union official ,  probably got lots of people want to see him dead .  the government &apos;s been investigating his links with the mafia . 
jack wouldn &apos;t kill for it .  besides ,  who would pay him ? 
everybody needs money .  except guys like twombley and that sonofabitch son - in - law of his .  people like that . 
jack doesn &apos;t need money . 
money . 
wade !  how can you even think such a thing ?  why would jack hewitt do that ,  shoot twombley on purpose ? 
i &apos;ve been wondering if maybe jack shot twombley ,  instead of twombley shooting himself .  i &apos;ve been wondering maybe jack shot him on purpose . 
 .  .  . jack &apos;s turned into one of those men who are permanently angry .  he used to be a sweet kid ,  but it &apos;s like ,  when he found out he couldn &apos;t play ball anymore ,  he changed .  now he &apos;s like everyone else . 
i &apos;m sure ,  i &apos;m positive it didn &apos;t happen the way jack says it did . 
i heard he was drunk at toby &apos;s last night and got in a fight with hettie .  he drove off without her .  .  . 
there &apos;s something funny about that shooting .  there &apos;s lots funny about it ,  actually . 
jack &apos;s sort of sensitive ,  i guess .  more than most .  but he &apos;ll be okay in a few weeks . 
okay . 
tonight .  let &apos;s get together . 
call me . 
the hell she isn &apos;t .  lillian &apos;s been trying to nail me to a cross since the day i met her .  i &apos;m gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from concord and get this thing ,  this divorce thing ,  rearranged .  i &apos;ve been thinking about it a lot .  it &apos;s like she owns jill or something .  nobody owns nobody ,  especially not kids .  and i pay her . 
no you don &apos;t .  you &apos;re pissed ,  that &apos;s all .  you ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with lillian .  you know ?  work it out with her ,  tell her how you feel .  lillian &apos;s not out to get you . 
yeah .  i mean that . 
you don &apos;t mean that . 
i &apos;m going to start one of those custody suits .  i don &apos;t give a fucking shit .  you know ? 
i &apos;m sorry . 
forget it . 
about you and jill and needing a third person .  she went back to lillian ? 
said what ? 
i &apos;m sorry about what i said . 
yeah . 
you okay ? 
yeah . 
you okay ? 
see you tomorrow ,  maybe . 
don &apos;t worry .  i can protect my virtue .  i mean ,  c &apos;mon ,  wade ,  give me a break . 
you two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party ,  give me a call ,  okay ?  i &apos;m off . 
okay .  she &apos;s fine . 
how &apos;s she doing ? 
for a while . 
new hat ?   jill &apos;s up ,  i see . 
makes me sad it was her .  instead of me .  i shoulda froze . 
can  -  -  ? 
it makes me sad . 
is .  .  .  ?  she &apos;s dead then ? 
when did she die ? 
coffee &apos;s perked . 
maybe wade should take a look at it .  your pipes &apos;ll freeze .   wade ,  would you do that ? 
it &apos;s broke i guess .  there &apos;s an electric in the bedroom . 
you &apos;re not using it today ? 
there &apos;s a furnace . 
have you been heating the house ?  not just with the stove . 
you get the hell out of my house now ,  asshole .  and know this  -  -  you are going to be a lucky asshole if i haven &apos;t got you fired before the day is out .  i can do it with one phone call ,  and i &apos;m pissed enough to do it now ! 
yes .  here &apos;s your ticket . 
doing your fucking job .  i know .  i watch television too . 
don &apos;t give me a hard time ,  mr .  gordon .  i &apos;m just  -  - 
you &apos;re talking about a goddamned ticket ,  from when i passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something ? 
don &apos;t ever put your hands on me ,  mr .  gordon . 
hold on ! 
yesterday morning ,  you passed a stopped school bus ,  which was flashing its lights ,  then you -  - 
moving violation !  i just got out of bed and you &apos;re telling me you &apos;re giving me a goddamn speeding ticket ?  now ?  are you nuts ?  is that it ,  whitehouse ?  you &apos;re nuts ? 
i &apos;m issuing you a ticket .  moving violation . 
what the hell are you talking about ? 
jesus christ .  mr .  gordon ,  when i come all the way to serve somebody a summons ,  i don &apos;t call ahead for an appointment . 
i said ,   &apos;next time ,  phone ahead .  &apos;
how &apos;s that ? 
whitehouse .  next time ,  phone ahead . 
can &apos;t it wait ,  then ? 
oh ,  no .  no ,  it &apos;s a .  .  .  it &apos;s a traffic thing .  no big deal . 
something about my father ? 
well ,  yeah ,  i suppose .  sure .  i just had a little business to settle with mr .  gordon .  i &apos;m the local police officer . 
mrs .  gordon .  thank you . 
well ,  yes ,  i &apos;m .  .  .  i want to say that i &apos;m real sorry about your father ,  mrs .  twombley . 
he &apos;s asleep .  we were up very late . 
i was .  .  .  i &apos;m wade whitehouse .  i was wondering ,  is your husband here ? 
who are you ? 
no ,  he &apos;s out now .  somewhere on the mountain .  i &apos;d stay away from him if i were you .  he &apos;s real pissed . 
he got his deer yet ? 
well ,  i guess  -  -  that &apos;s what he said . 
his office .  you mean my old office . 
wade ,  i got a message for you .   jack hewitt ,  he &apos;s looking for you .  wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in town hall . 
it &apos;s called a grilled cheese sandwich ,  you dub . 
jillie ,  you want a cheese grilled sandwich ? 
no ,  i .  .  .  i &apos;ve been out on the grader all morning .  twombley &apos;s summer people .  massachusetts .  friend of gordon &apos;s .  it was his idea for jack to take him hunting .   i gotta go . 
cb .  little while ago .  one of the boys on the way in picked up jack on the cb calling for state troopers .  i figured you &apos;d know what really happened .  the fucking guy kill himself ?  this twombley ,  who the fuck is he ,  anyhow ? 
where .  .  .  how &apos;d you hear that ? 
the other guy . 
jack ? 
the fucker shot himself .  ker - bang !  that &apos;s what it sounds like .  not on purpose .  i assume accidental . 
not since last night .  he took a guy hunting . 
you talked to jack ? 
marg !  you got orders ! 
that goddamned woman .  thinks she can cart jill off and leave me alone like this .  i &apos;m more than pissed ,  margie .  i &apos;m a whole lot more than pissed .  i been that plenty and i know the difference .  this is different . 
marg ! 
aw ,  c &apos;mon ,  i was only saying there &apos;s something wrong with  &quot; home made cooking &quot;  ,  that &apos;s all .  the sign &apos;s fine .  what it says is wrong . 
this town sucks . 
i &apos;m not finding fault .  it &apos;s a good idea ,  good for you ,  good for the town .  real modern too . 
fuck .  wade whitehouse .  it &apos;s people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering .  whatever somebody does to improve things around here ,  you gotta find fault with it . 
the sign .  it looks like it &apos;s spelled wrong or something . 
what ? 
it don &apos;t look right . 
you be careful of that little bastard .  he &apos;s dying to get in your pants ,  you know . 
take care ,  wade . 
i don &apos;t know you .  my goddamn father and i don &apos;t know you . 
nothing in the fucking house to drink .  not a fucking thing .  my house ,  my money ,  my truck  -  -  stolen ! 
crawl ! 
where the christ you going ?  you sonofabitch ,  you leave my fucking truck where it is !  i need .  .  .  give me the goddamn keys !  i need to get me to town ! 
you and me . 
bang ! 
yeah . 
everything you know is from me . 
call it what you want . 
love !  i &apos;m made of love ! 
love !  what the fuck do you know about love ? 
nah - nah - naw !  you done done finally done it !  like a man done it .  done it right .  i love you ,  you mean sonofabitch ! 
you don &apos;t know me .  you don &apos;t know me !   so fuck you .  fuck you . 
you !  by christ ,  you  -  -  i know you .   yeah ,  you goddamn sonofabitch ,  i know you .  you &apos;re a goddamn fucking piece of my heart ! 
you think you can take me now ?  come on ,  try . 
pop ,  for christ &apos;s sake ! 
come on ,  smart guy .  tell how it &apos;s no big deal .  tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman &apos;s head . 
listen ,  it &apos;s no big deal ,  pop . 
wade .  i thought she was alright .  till this morning she was . 
why didn &apos;t you call and have the furnace fixed ? 
in the living room . 
is there something wrong with the phone ? 
i checked on her .  she had the electric heater .  cold don &apos;t bother her as much as me .  which is why i give her the heater . 
yeah . 
she &apos;s coming . 
where &apos;s ma ? 
yeah . 
we &apos;re alright .  your ma &apos;s sleeping .  you want me to get her ? 
how you and ma doing ?  haven &apos;t seen you in town for a while . 
from wickham &apos;s .  been a while .  like some coffee ? 
you remember margie fogg ? 
sleeping . 
jesus ,  pop ,  how can you stand the cold ,  dressed like that ?  where &apos;s ma ? 
you no - good pup ! 
nothing . 
what was that ?   you got something to say ,  say it !  say it ! 
atta - go . 
just do it . 
a lesson in work and its rewards .  you &apos;ll thank me for this one day .   sally ,  turn off that tv ! 
rolfe . 
take care of the little things first ,  the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things .  call chub merritt ,  get your car back ,  call a dentist ,  for god &apos;s sake ,  and get your tooth pulled ,  don &apos;t trust the locals ,  get your facts straight and go straight to the state police .  let them work on this . 
to help ,  jack ,  of course  -  -  and to nail those sonsofbitches ,  the two gordons .  that &apos;s what alma calls them .  jesus ,  rolfe ,  whose side are you on ? 
for what ? 
i know what it means .  i &apos;m just running out of ways to use it . 
but you gotta hear this .  you won &apos;t believe it .  mel gordon had come by to visit lariviere and so now i &apos;m in his office . 
wade ,  are you alright ? 
then you accidentally see your body ,  or your face ,  or whatever ,  and you don &apos;t know who the hell it belongs to .  strange .  it &apos;s the business with the old man ,  i know ,  and how incredibly pissed i was at him ,  and also chasing jack hewitt like that ,  and the goddamned truck going through the ice ,  not to mention margie &apos;s being so upset  -  -  one thing on top of another . 
that &apos;s what you think . 
i remember clearly cause when i heard i became real careful around pop .  i was a careful child and i became a careful adult ,  but at least i wasn &apos;t afflicted by that man &apos;s violence . 
well ,  i never heard that one . 
and elbourne and mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft . 
we &apos;d have to go digging in vietnam to ask him . 
it wasn &apos;t me .  i wasn &apos;t there ,  but i heard about it .  when i heard about it ,  it was about elbourne . 
you think i wouldn &apos;t remember a thing like that ? 
it may have happened ,  but not the way you said . 
of course it happened .  why would i lie about it ? 
i hate to disappoint you ,  but i don &apos;t think it happened . 
yeah . 
i was thinking about that story you told me ,  about pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after . 
i care about what happened .  the truth .  i &apos;m a student of history ,  remember ? 
right &apos;s right ,  goddamnit !  don &apos;t you care what &apos;s right ? 
not particularly . 
it &apos;s too neat .  things ain &apos;t that neat .  it makes me mad .  that somebody can pay to kill somebody ,  his own father - in - law ,  and not be punished for it .  don &apos;t that piss you off ? 
shit ,  around here ,  you shoot somebody in the woods ,  you say it was an accident ,  you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted .  jack &apos;s probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain &apos;t got his deer yet and don &apos;t want his license pulled . 
a hunting accident is perfect . 
so mel gordon wouldn &apos;t want a professional hit .  that &apos;d make the feds dig deeper .  he wants an accident . 
here &apos;s my theory .  twombley ,  unaware of illegal union loans or whatever ,  starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out .  finds out his son - in - law is involved . 
yeah ,  the guy with the bmw i told you about .  i did ,  didn &apos;t i ? 
okay .  it &apos;s likely there are people in the union who don &apos;t want twombley to testify .  they probably include his son - in - law who &apos;s vice - president and will probably be the next president .  i read that in the papers .  what &apos;s his name ,  mel gordon ? 
i don &apos;t know .  you tell me . 
they wouldn &apos;t deal with a guy like jack .  who else benefits if twombley is suddenly dead ? 
who &apos;d pay him that kind of money ?  not the mob .  they got their own guys .  specialists . 
money . 
motive .  you gotta have a motive . 
well ,  your friend ,  i think .  jack hewitt . 
then who shot him ? 
that it wasn &apos;t an accident . 
which is ? 
i think your first response to the twombley shooting was the correct one . 
find them everywhere .  
want to know what i think happened ? 
i guess it was an accident ,  like everybody thinks . 
anything new about the shooting ?  twombley ? 
i want to let the gas run out .  i don &apos;t want the bastard driving drunk ,  and he &apos;s always drunk now .  after ,  we &apos;ll hide the keys . 
yeah .  she &apos;ll probably quit her job and stay out here with pop .  we can &apos;t leave him alone here ,  he &apos;ll set the damn place on fire .  with jill here a lot ,  it &apos;ll be good to have margie around .  things are going to change in that department ,  by the way .  i got a custody lawyer in concord .  i &apos;m gonna see him tomorrow .  all hell &apos;s gonna break loose ,  but it &apos;s worth it . 
well ,  do you still plan to get married ? 
what about her ? 
what about margie ? 
yeah .  i forgot . 
no thanks .  i don &apos;t drink . 
anyone else want one ?  rolfe ? 
what about jill ?  is lillian bringing her ? 
pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do ,  i guess . 
no ,  no ,  i haven &apos;t .  not really .  i &apos;ve growled a little ,  but i haven &apos;t bit . 
haven &apos;t you already done a bit of that ? 
i get to feeling like a whipped dog some days ,  rolfe ,  and some night i &apos;m going to bite back .  i swear it . 
get some sleep . 
yeah ,  i guess . 
don &apos;t think about it .  you &apos;re exhausted . 
a divorce lawyer .  a custody lawyer .  you know ,   &apos;cause of jill . 
what happened ? 
jill .  i was thinking of getting a lawyer .  maybe you can help me . 
who ? 
picked up jill .  she was supposed to visit for the weekend for halloween .  she wanted to go home . 
how was she ? 
the night before the shooting . 
huh ? 
lillian was here .  in lawford . 
they were out deer hunting ,  right ?  jack probably heard the gun go off ,  then came back and found the body . 
well ,  it was an accident . 
you think jack shot him ? 
no shit . 
twombley . 
who ? 
he was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in new england and the construction business . 
it &apos;ll come out jack lied and the kid &apos;ll get hung for it . 
no ,  not tonight .  i &apos;m in bed too .  i &apos;m calling because i need you to listen .  you &apos;re supposed to be a smart guy .  you &apos;re a professor .  i got this theory .  jack says he didn &apos;t see twombley shot but he did . 
wade ,  it &apos;s late .  i know you &apos;re probably at toby &apos;s ,  but i &apos;m in bed reading .  we got different habits . 
yeah ,  i know him  -  -  the kid that was with him .  maybe you do too .  jack hewitt .  he works for lariviere with me .  he &apos;s my best friend . 
there was something .  it happened up your way . 
yeah ,  brother ,  look ,  i was calling cause  -  -  has there been anything on tv in boston about a hunting accident with a guy named twombley ,  evan twombley ? 
wade ? 
rolfe . 
jim .  .  .  for godsake ! 
daddy .  daddy ,  please .  .  . 
i &apos;m sorry i was so mean to you earlier . 
yes dear ? 
mom ? 
big secret .   you said the same thing to newsweek . 
you &apos;re right and i &apos;ll tell you a secret .   i know exactly how you feel . 
that &apos;s not really the point . 
some kids were teasing you ? 
i know .  .  .   but lotsa times i feel like it &apos;s me versus the world .   some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in bangladesh .   i mean it doesn &apos;t take a genius to figure which is more important . 
your father never means to be so .  .  . 
when i write my memoirs i think i &apos;ll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard air force one . 
no ,  it &apos;s okay .   after all ,  he is the president ,  right ? 
i &apos;m sorry ,  honey . 
he &apos;s in a meeting .   he can &apos;t be disturbed . 
i know ,  mom .   it was great .  .  .  really . 
we &apos;ll talk at home .   you know ,  most girls aren &apos;t as lucky as you .   for most girls seeing the bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime . 
back at the fishbowl ? 
you &apos;re jet - lagged .   we &apos;ll talk about this back .  .  . 
mom ,  just this once ,  give it a rest . 
alice .  .  . 
hey joey ,  how `bout a cocoa ,  double whip cream . 
don &apos;t you even want to ask ? 
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s busy . 
you don &apos;t want to say hi to your father ? 
yeah ,  no duh . 
well ,  you aren &apos;t the president ,  dear . 
it &apos;s not like he hasn &apos;t made us wait a few times . 
you are a resilient man ,  mr . 
he didn &apos;t leave us . 
it would be a pity to squander such a strong personality . 
fuck off ,  you stupid asshole . 
that &apos;s the way of the world ,  little one .  didn &apos;t they teach you that in school ? 
the woman you shot .  she was my friend . 
yeah .  do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means . 
smart for your age ,  eh ?  top of your class ?  tell me ,  do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means ? 
yeah ,  i study world events .  five thousand turkienistan muslims were slaughtered in stravanvitch &apos;s cleansings .  .  .  along with 15 american school kids .  you know hqw i studied that .  i went to their funerals with my dad .  i met their parents . 
so ,  you study world events ,  little one .  that &apos;s good for a girl your age . 
you &apos;re one of stravanavitch &apos;s men . 
no ,  thank you .  the gunfire did that . 
you must be tired .  it &apos;ll wake you up . 
i don &apos;t drink coffee . 
okay ,  i &apos;m slowing us down . 
there they are ! 
it &apos;s okay ,  honey .  i got you .  i got you .  you &apos;re okay . 
oh ny god .  .  .  oh my god .  .  .  oh my god .  .  . 
been better ,  dad .  .  .  you ? 
how you doing ,  sweetie ? 
alice .  .  .  i .  .  . 
daddy .  .  . 
daddy .  .  . 
alice ! 
how `bout a hug for the old man . 
it was the experience of a lifetime . 
how was .  .  .    .  .  . the ballet ? 
hey ,  you guys back already ? 
oooooh ,  i &apos;m good . 
warn then again .  if they don &apos;t respond .  .  .  shoot them down .  we will not be intimidated . 
the pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet . 
the world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner . 
they are in our airspace .  we would be within our rights . 
it &apos;s some kind of trick .  .  .  a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement . 
yes .  they refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails . 
did we warn them off ? 
the americans say they are escorting a damaged plane .  our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747 . 
cross it .  .  .   the static overwhelms the voice ,  then cuts out . 
it &apos;s cut . 
okay ,  you &apos;re aerated .  to dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump .  there &apos;s no switch in avionics so you &apos;ll have to cross the wires .  there should be five wires ,  just to your left .  do you see them ? 
okay ,  it &apos;s on .  we &apos;ve got some indicator lights here . 
pop it open .  there should be a red switch ,  toggle it up . 
got it . 
do you see the maintenance panel ? 
uh ,  tower ,  we got a problem up here . 
sluggish .  .  .  i think it &apos;s jammed too . 
aw ,  man .  you &apos;re torn up pretty bad out here ,  sir .  do you have any elevater control . 
lemme take a look . 
no .  we &apos;re losing fuel and my rudder &apos;s not responding . 
just stay on my wing ,  sir .  i &apos;ll take you all the way in . 
uh ,  we got a problem here . 
we still got three migs running around and six more on the way . 
how we doing ,  colonel ? 
stay cool . 
got it . 
okay .  we &apos;re gonna arc a fat one to the right .  got it ? 
two and three are heading toward the boeing . 
i &apos;m doing what i can . 
who &apos;s flying the fucking plane ? 
he &apos;s busy being dead . 
put your pilot on . 
you read my mind . 
mr .  president ,  it &apos;s an honor .  now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here . 
copy air force one .  welcome to the party . 
u . s .  pilots ,  this is air force one . 
that &apos;s game ,  set ,  and match .  there &apos;s nothing to do ,  except call the chief justice . 
i prefered the terrorists . 
they &apos;ve got no chutes .  they can &apos;t control the plane ,  their engines are failing and they &apos;re losing fuel . 
this doesn &apos;t make sense . 
they aren &apos;t answering their hails . 
that kid &apos;s name was jim marshall . 
walter ,  if you have a point ,  make it . 
holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you &apos;re making demands . 
we don &apos;t know that . 
he &apos;s dead then .  they must have killed him . 
an exercise in futility .  send the nimitz back in . 
the iraqi ambassador is claiming it &apos;s just an exercise . 
put together a score sheet .   i &apos;ll make some calls . 
apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn &apos;t as popular as we thought it &apos;d be .   representative taylor is working on a compromise . 
thanks .   wrote it last night . 
it was a good ad - lib ,  sir . 
goddamn right i did .   i asked for a tough - as - nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit .   what &apos;s the point in having a speech if i have to ad - lib ? 
sir ,  you threw out page two . 
to swear you in as president . 
the chief justice ?  what on earth for ? 
if fired upon ,  tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage . 
iraqi &apos;s won &apos;t buy it .  either they &apos;re already in on this or they &apos;ll think we &apos;re spying . 
if challenged ,  our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission . 
like any good poker player ,  they &apos;re checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard . 
they still have the president ,  it &apos;s past their deadline and they haven &apos;t called .  what do you think it means ? 
okay .  also ,  i want you to put our bases in turkey on alert ,  and have the kitty hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike . 
i hate to be pragmatic ,  but they &apos;ll sacrifice pawns before kings .  it may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff . 
but they start executing hostages in
we &apos;ve got four hours before they make it into turkienistan airspace . 
can we do that ? 
does your office have anything to add ,  mr .  dean ? 
general greely says it looks like the middle east . 
my loyalty was never to my country . 
you &apos;re duty to what ?  the country you served doesn &apos;t exist anymore . 
because it is my duty . 
why ? 
yes ,  mr .  president . 
special agent gibbs .  you helped do this ? 
ga get it . 
that &apos;s affirmative . 
roger . 
air force one ,  please reduce speed to 250 knots . 
air force one ,  acknowledged .   tnt .  emergency parachute launch ramp . 
please change course to zero seven four and drop to eighteen thousand feet .  over . 
about goddamn time . 
air force one ,  this is af - 135 - ra .  we have been instructed to refuel your plane . 
no !  if we land this plane anywhere else ,  we will end up another entebe .   the americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud ,  evades missiles and .  .  .   refuels in mid - air .  call the white house . 
over the black sea .  i can probably get us to turkey or georgia . 
where are we now ? 
not even close .  hell ,  we can &apos;t even make syria or iraq . 
we &apos;re not going to make it . 
we &apos;ve stopped dumping .  .  .  but we &apos;ve only got about twenty minutes of fuel left . 
go !  take serge .  .  and watch your backs . 
avionics compartment !  it &apos;s the only place .  you better get zedeck down there fast unless ,  of course ,  you &apos;d rather be a martyr than a savior . 
how ? 
well it worked . 
psychology .  they &apos;re trying to unnerve us . 
why did they do that ? 
remarkable aircraft .  remarkable . 
a secret service agent .  it must be . 
we checked the manifest .  everyone was accounted for . 
who did this ? 
any of us ? 
nine . 
how many others killed ? 
dead . 
the rest of the secret service ? 
sir ,  this plane carries the president of the united states . 
we &apos;ve already been inspected . 
copy ,  air force one . 
this is romeo tango zulu changing call signs .   tower ,  alert air traffic ,  romeo tango zulu is now air force one .   this is air force one .  .  .  the president is safe onboard . 
tower ,  here . 
we copy .  stand by .  .  .   tower ? 
romeo tango zulu1 this is tower . 
stand by . 
romeo tango zulu ,  do you have the president ?  over . 
romeo tango zulu ,  copy one the television ,  graphics of the first family against the presidential seal . 
tower ,  air force one has been boarded . 
very good .  thank you ,  ms .  mitchell . 
you &apos;re pointing a gun at me . 
scared .  we &apos;re scared . 
how are your fellow hostages feeling ,  ms .  mitchell ? 
i &apos;m responsible for press relations for the flight office . 
and what is it you do ,  ms .  mitchell . 
maria .  .  .  maria mitchell . 
*                     please tell me your name . 
thank you . 
here &apos;s a press kit .   i &apos;ll let you guys get comfortable and once we &apos;re airborne i &apos;ll be able to schedule the interviews . 
conference rooms ,  though some have other functions .   the one up front doubles as an emergency medical center . 
and all these rooms here ? 
i guess it depends on your perspective . 
a dubious distinction ,  no ? 
you don &apos;t know the half of it .   did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation ?   we could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary . 
this is a remarkable aircraft . 
up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the mission communication center .  the mcc ,  as we call it ,  can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth .   we &apos;re linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations .   we could run the country or run a war from there if we had to . 
the president and i were delighted that we could accommodate you .   now if you &apos;re all cleared ?   you can follow me then . 
ms .   mitchell .   so nice to finally meet you in person . 
you &apos;re very valuable .  and our nation needs so many things . 
you got what you wanted .  you going to release us now ? 
three .  .  . 
jim .  .  . 
four .  .  . 
please .  you can kill me but leave my daughter alone . 
the world is such a dangerous place and we can &apos;t always protect our children . 
you will be the first to pay for that mistake . 
nor will there be .  my husband does not negotiate with terrorists . 
say something dear . 
no . 
shall i begin by executing the president &apos;s daughter ?  she &apos;s right here . 
so is this .   come now ,  you &apos;re upsetting the little one . 
that was war . 
but they are not ny people .  you look at me as if i am a monster ,  but answer me this  -  -  when your planes bombed the oil fields of iraq ,  did you cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who &apos;s faces you will never see ?  did you cry for their wives and children .  they were people too ,  yes .  .  .  but they were not your people . 
how can you ?  i mean they &apos;re people . 
i neither enjoy nor dislike .  i do what is necessary . 
why ?  do you enjoy it ? 
yes
do you have to be so brutal ? 
your husband is a coward .  he sends soldiers half - way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night . 
my husband is a very courageous man . 
i know he left you behind . 
what do you know of my husband ? 
or you will do what ,  mrs .  marshall ?   but i admire your courage .  your husband ,  on the other hand .  .  . 
leave my daughter alone . 
come on ,  alice . 
now ,  or he dies ,  please . 
cooperation .  if you try to escape ,  you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade &apos;s bodies will prevent you from exiting .  good day . 
what do you want with us ? 
fear will keep you alive .  any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish ,  and bound to die . 
hold on ,  alice . 
no you won &apos;t .  you &apos;ll compromise .  .  .  like always . 
if you put down the gun ,  i promise not to drop her on the way down . 
let my daughter go or i &apos;ll take you out ! 
there goes your ride . 
one thing i &apos;ve learned as
the taste of defeat is bitter ,  no ? 
you don &apos;t like seeing people get hurt .  now in morality ,  that is a virtue .  in politics ,  however ,  that is weakness .   you were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
someday ,  you &apos;ll regret my nature . 
good .  good . 
yes ,  i &apos;ll do it .   just leave my family alone . 
you &apos;ll do it ? 
stop . 
pity .  mr .  gibbs . 
this administration does not negotiate with terrorists . 
call up petrov and order stravanavitch &apos; s release . 
she isn &apos;t a part of this .  this is between you and me . 
no .  but since i only have a few of your staff left to kill ,  perhaps i will start with your family instead .  .  .  gibbs . 
over my dead body . 
now since we &apos;ve had very little luck getting washington or moscow to cooperate ,  i wondered if you would be so kind . 
i &apos;m sure we can strike some sort of arrangement .  land the plane and we &apos;ll trade you hostages for fuel . 
finally ,  we can bargain . 
yes .  you &apos;ve made yourself quite clear . 
madame vice president .  we have an options paper .   chandler takes the options paper ,  waves off lee ,  and reads it as she talks . 
you heard me .   you .  congress and cabinet heads . 
twenty minutes ? 
okay ,  gentlemen ,  we &apos;ll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane .  .  .  lee ,  go huddle with the d . o . d .  i want an options paper on this in 20 minutes . 
our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground .  our hands are completely tied while they &apos;re in the air . 
that isn &apos;t necessary . 
sir ,  we stay with the president . 
yes ,  sir . 
i &apos;ll not going without my family . 
got it . 
eighteen thousand feet ,  sir .  and two hundred knots .  .  .  otherwise it &apos;s suicide . 
get `em ready .   you .  .  .  come with me . 
they &apos;ve cut communication ,  and i spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives .  my only solution ran out of batteries . 
we can &apos;t jump from here or at this speed .  but if we could get a message out  -  tell the refueling plane .  .  . 
we &apos;ve already played our cards ,  major .  there &apos;s no turning back . 
gravity . 
mr .  caidwell ,  the ground &apos;s a few miles away .  how do you propose getting us from here to there ? 
tell our boys to cool their jets .  i don &apos;t need `em creating policy for me . 
the northern border &apos;s gotten a bit hairy .  their migs are playing tag with our tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage . 
they &apos;ve gotta be joking . 
our kh - ll &apos;s took this one at 0100 hours .  what you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades . 
you haven &apos;t even driven a car since you took office . 
flying the plane . 
what are you doing ? 
both of you . 
call petrov .  .  .   i &apos;ll be back . 
please .  .  .  don &apos;t start with me . 
i don &apos;t know why you stayed . 
shall i ask the chief of staff to schedule your daughter in ? 
look on the bright side ,  hon .  shep here thinks i &apos;ll be a one termer . 
well ,  they aren &apos;t burning me in effigy .  that &apos;s always a good sign . 
how did your speech go ? 
this promise isn &apos;t subject to congressional approval . 
i should trust that promise ?  because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut . 
i &apos;ll make it up to you ,  i promise . 
i wish it were that easy .  .  . 
but that &apos;s the point ,  jim .  we &apos;re right here . 
i miss you .  and i miss her . 
what ? 
you know what ? 
and when have i had five minutes ?  when i wake up in the morning and i &apos;m already three hours behind schedule .   what do you want me to do ,  rose ,  tell the g7 to fuck off because i &apos;m a family man ? 
how do you know she understands ?  you haven &apos;t spent more than five minutes with her ,  or me ,  in weeks . 
she &apos;s a big girl .   she understands . 
for godsakes ,  jim ,  slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy .   not even you can plug all the world &apos;s leaks .   don &apos;t you think it &apos;s a sign you &apos;re pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on mtv news than in person . 
rose ,  i don &apos;t have time for this . 
don &apos;t .   i know spin control when i feel it . 
no ,  mr .  president .   it can &apos;t . 
can &apos;t it wait ? 
may i speak to you for a moment ? 
actually ,  sir ,  you could be that someone . 
someone should give you a raise . 
white house situation room . 
where are we sending it ? 
no .  i thought about this ,  mr . 
no good .  i said they disabled the communications system . 
the fax machines . 
excuse me ? 
the fax machines . 
freeing stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed .  i can &apos;t live with that .   i &apos;m not royalty .  i &apos;m an elected official and the integrity of the office of the president is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office .   we don &apos;t negotitate .  not as long as i &apos;m president .  is that understood ? 
please ,  mr .  president .  you &apos;re going to get yourself killed .  is that your solution ? 
but this is different ,  sir .  you &apos;re the president . 
you know my policy .  we don &apos;t negotiate with terrorists .  if we start now ,  all of america becomes a target . 
and if that means negotiating .  .  . 
then tell me there &apos;s a rescue operation underway . 
they &apos;re still alive ,  but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes . 
did they say anything about my family ? 
two .  .  .  three .  go ! 
but .  .  . 
one . 
we &apos;re handling it ,  sir . 
where &apos;s my family ? 
we &apos;re under attack . 
what &apos;s going on ? 
no .  no .  no .  wait .  wait . 
thank you for calling the white house .  .  . 
look lady ,  i don &apos;t have time for games .  just put the .  .  .  . 
okay .  .  .  if you &apos;re the president ,  when &apos;s your wife &apos;s birthday ? 
you don &apos;t understand .  this is an emergency .  let me talk to anyone . 
sir ,  the president does not call this particular number .  so whoever you are get a life ,  before i have this call traced . 
don &apos;t cut me off .  this is an emergency . 
yeah ,  right . 
this is the president . 
who can i say is calling ? 
okay listen ,  listen carefully .  this is an emergency call from air force one .  who &apos;s there ?  is the vice -  president there ? 
white house switchboard .  how may i direct your call . 
we &apos;re hooked .  hove into position . 
we &apos;re hooked !
